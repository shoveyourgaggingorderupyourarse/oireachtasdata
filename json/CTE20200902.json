Our 19,500 members deliver high-quality public education across a wide range of settings, including second level schools and colleges, centres for education, institutes of technology and technological universities.  The TUI would like to thank all the principals and deputy principals, teachers, special needs assistants, school secretaries and caretakers, all of whom have worked tirelessly over the past few months to get schools ready to welcome back students.<\/p> <p>  The closure of school buildings on 12 March and its impact on staff and students have demonstrated beyond doubt that, notwithstanding the significant efforts made to ensure continuity of learning, nothing replaces face-to-face teaching and learning.  The schools we left on 12 March have been completely reconfigured and look very different.  A TUI survey of more than 120 second level schools, conducted in mid-August, illustrated significant challenges involved in a safe reopening, including difficulties employing contractors to make adjustments to buildings and difficulties recruiting teachers at a time when a two-tier pay system imposed by the Government is still undermining the morale of the profession.  The injustice of the two-tier pay system came to the fore again when the Department provided additional supervision to schools and decided to pay teachers differently, depending on their start date, to undertake the exact same work.  This damaging discrimination needs to end.<\/p> <p>  TUI members will not accept any departure from the public health guidelines, including the absolute necessity to maintain a physical distance of not less than 1 m - preferably 2 m - in our schools.  Unfortunately, we have had reports in recent days of schools that have not yet put the necessary measures in place.  We reiterate that the TUI will not permit non-compliance on this key issue.  The entire school community must observe and respect public health advice and do everything possible to minimise the spread of Covid-19.  Schools have already made significant adjustments, but they need the ability to ensure compliance with these measures.  Therefore, a nationally mandated addendum to a school&rsquo;s code of behaviour is required.  As soft face coverings are a critical safety measure, a policy is needed to prevent the wearing of soft face coverings with slogans or logos that may be offensive in a school community. <\/p> <p>  While the TUI welcomes the resources put in place by the Department to date, the challenges faced by schools are significant because our education system was chronically underfunded before the current health emergency, with the lowest spend on second level education compared with other OECD countries and the largest class size in Europe.  Furthermore, it is necessary that a safe and available school transport system is in place for all students who rely on that service.  The TUI will keep the circumstances in each school under review and if more resources are required, we will unapologetically seek them.<\/p><p>Any delay in providing necessary resources puts at unacceptable risk the health and safety of our school communities.<\/p><p> Many teachers do not have school-provided ICT devices.  They are uploading licensed software to personal devices.  This is unsatisfactory.  Teachers also need ICT training, in case the need arises to close a school partially or fully.<\/p><p> Some schools have a significant number of students categorised as very high risk and additional resources will be needed to ensure those students have access to technology to continue their education at home.  A major obstacle in this regard is the digital divide, where some students simply do not have access to broadband or the required technology to engage effectively.  Failure to address this will exacerbate inequality.<\/p><p> We must not forget that a teacher&rsquo;s workplace is the school and schools are crowded places.  A teacher working in a classroom of 49 sq. m can have up to 24 students with him or her in a class.  Some teachers have been categorised by the occupational health provider, OHP, as being at high risk although their own medical advisers have categorised them as being very high risk and working like this creates acute anxiety in the workplace.  The TUI made strong representations to the Minister on this matter and confirmation of an appeal process is welcome.  Given the rise in the number of young adults being tested for Covid-19, and the fact that many of our students are young adults, the TUI asserts that access to rapid Covid-19 testing for all staff and students is essential to help limit disruption in schools.  <\/p><p> We welcome the adjustments to the assessments for State examinations.  However, further adjustments to the curriculum or assessments or both may also be required as circumstances unfold.  Our students with special educational needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot be forgotten or left behind.  Customised interventions and supports may be required to reintegrate them into school.  Our members will work to ensure these students are identified early and prioritised.  Failure to do so will have a lifelong effect on these students. <\/p><p> The TUI has stated emphatically and repeatedly that we will operate in accordance with the public health advice.  We will not put our students, their families, their communities and teachers at risk.  Our members have played a critical role in reopening our schools but we now need to tackle the next challenges, which include keeping schools open and making sure no student, for whatever reason, is left behind and that teachers can maintain a worthwhile educational experience for all students.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to maintain the intensive ongoing engagement between the various partners to meet these challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gillespie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gillespie.

Phenomenal work to prepare was undertaken by school management teams, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and ancillary staff across the country.  Over those weeks, the ASTI commissioned research and some of the sample findings included 84% of principals reporting that their schools did not have a dedicated ventilation system and 25% of principals stating their schools did not have warm water in the school toilet facilities.  A previous RED C survey commissioned by the ASTI found that 49% of teachers believed they work in schools with overcrowding in classrooms and 60% considered that there was inadequate storage available for staff and students.  Indeed, Ireland ranks last of 35 OECD countries for investment in second-level education as a percentage of GDP. <\/p> <p>  This lack of investment must be addressed if schools are to continue to operate safely in the context of Covid-19.  The ASTI is demanding that the Department of Education and Skills commission new school buildings and, in the meantime, order prefabs in recognition that the Government's approach of living alongside the virus into the future is going to require major investment in school infrastructure.  Concerns also emerged about the feasibility of social distancing for students throughout school buildings, with 70% of principals surveyed rating the feasibility of social distancing in school corridors and other communal areas as weak.<\/p> <p>  We demand that an urgent review be undertaken of the physical distancing requirements for schools, given the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, advice that only six people should congregate in any indoor setting and the lack of clarity in the guidance that underpins the operation of schools.  We wrote to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and to the Minister for Health seeking a meeting with the HPSC, but our request has been declined thus far.  <\/p> <p>  We have a question about the possibility of putting fast-track testing in place for schools in order to get results back in 24 hours, similar to those in the healthcare system, or within 48 hours at most.  Why has this not been recommended and put in place?  Why was there no recommendation to put Perspex, for instance, in front of teachers&rsquo; desks in classrooms, as I notice is in front of the Acting Chairman here today?<\/p><p>Why is there no temperature testing, at least for adults, when they arrive in school each day?  Why was no guidance given on the numbers that could congregate for assemblies and staff meetings in schools?<\/p><p> We also seek clarity on the safety issues involved for students and teachers in the high-risk category.  The ASTI has members whose illnesses include chronic kidney disease, cancer and serious heart disease.  Anxiety levels among this group are very high.  It is unconscionable that teachers who suffer the likes of these illnesses are being required to return to classrooms teaching sizeable groups.  The ASTI demands alternative arrangements, such as working from home, for teachers who are in the high-risk category.  <\/p><p> Additional concerns that we would like to discuss with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, have emerged further to the publication last week of the document, Schools Pathway for Covid-19, the Public Health approach.  Provisions that are of concern include that where a case has been confirmed, it will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts; there is no blanket policy on testing entire year groups and classes in place; schools are not to inform parents or staff if a pupil or staff member goes home with symptoms; if someone goes home with symptoms, other staff and students do not need to be removed from the class, including siblings or other household members; and contact tracing will be done on a case-by-case basis.  Experts have argued that if a single child is infected, the entire pod has to go home and isolate for two weeks and get tested.  It is regrettable that those who are effectively making the decisions on these matters are refusing to meet representatives of those directly affected by them.<\/p><p> In addition, the Department of Education and Skills appears to be doing very little planning for the possibility that there might be individual schools or groups of schools closing down for a period.  We all want the sustained reopening of schools and hope that this will not happen.  However, this virus has shown itself to be persistent and it would be foolhardy to discount the possibility of closures. <\/p><p> Since the closure of schools in March 2020, the ASTI has repeatedly stated that remote learning is no replacement for face-to-face interaction between students and their teachers.  That is a given.  We have deep concerns about the lack of access to IT resources and broadband in many households.  Teachers have spoken of finding three and four siblings working from one device.  We have demanded that the Department of Education and Skills bulk purchase laptops for students and teachers so that every student has access to reliable IT equipment in the event of future closures.<\/p><p> On another matter, while the appointment of additional second level teachers is to be welcomed, the measure is inadequate in terms of achieving manageable class sizes and cover for Covid-19 sick leave during the pandemic.  This is a major concern.<\/p><p> Investment in education must be seriously increased.  We need support for teacher and student health and well-being, particularly the provision of alternative arrangements for the most medically vulnerable in our school communities.  Guidance and advice to the system related to physical distancing need to be reviewed and updated.  Staffing levels need to be adequately maintained and there must be proper contingency arrangements put in place to prepare for all eventualities. <\/p><p> My colleague from the TUI mentioned the situation regarding equal pay for equal work.  It is unfortunate that the pandemic has not put an end to those kinds of practices in schools.  We also call for an end to them.  I will have additional points to make later.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Christie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599001200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee this week as more than 500,000 pupils and 50,000 staff return to their primary and special school buildings.  There is excitement and trepidation in equal measure.  While INTO members are taking on the challenge of restarting formal education in the school system, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken and all protections are in place to safeguard the members of the school community.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the progress made to date by the Department of Education and Skills with strong input from stakeholders, including the INTO.  The publication of the roadmap for primary and special schools was welcomed.  The urgent calls for additional resources and a centralised procurement system for the purchase of hand sanitiser and personal protective equipment, PPE, were listened to and acted upon.  The additional grants to schools are also welcome and efforts to ensure they were paid in a timely fashion are appreciated.  We also welcome the establishment of the supply panels and other teacher supply measures as a way to improve access to substitute teachers in the event of a teacher becoming sick or self-isolating with Covid-19 symptoms.<\/p><p>The INTO further welcomes the announcement that no new school self-evaluation activities will be expected this year, and that the inspectorate&rsquo;s role will be more advisory and supportive.<\/p><p> I commend the serious volume of work that was done in schools throughout the country all over the summer, especially the sacrifices made by principal teachers and those who directly supported them.  As we know, classrooms have been reconfigured and stripped of extraneous furniture, new sanitation stations have been installed, one-way systems have been mapped out, signage has been placed everywhere and communication with parents is ongoing.  These practical matters are all in addition to the many changes involved in classroom management, supervising and reassuring pupils, creating class bubbles and pods and adapting the curriculum and teaching and learning to fit the new reality.  Returning safely to school is a common goal shared by all members of the school community.  Ongoing communication via the national media will be vital to ensure buy-in from the entire school community.  Clear advice and guidance for parents on supporting their children will be required throughout the entire year.<\/p><p> As has been stated by my colleagues, we must facilitate teachers who are in the high risk category.  We called for and received assurances that a robust appeal mechanism will be available to those who dispute original medical evaluations conducted by the occupational health service, Medmark.  We must also ensure that everyone in the education sector has quick access to testing and tracing and that there is an ongoing surveillance system for the education sector.  Schools are essential services and they are now the new front line in the battle against Covid-19.  Of course, our teachers want to be back in school but they must have full confidence that where a case arises all necessary measures, to use the words of Dr. Ronan Glynn, will be taken to protect students and staff.<\/p><p> It is also essential that employers show flexibility for workers whose children have to self-isolate and that such workers receive payment while they are absent from their workplaces minding sick children.  Otherwise, they will be disinclined to keep their children at home, adding further pressure and making schools unsafe.  School leaders will need ongoing access to guidance, in addition to their leadership and management days, to deal with the additional responsibilities that continue to fall on them.  The introduction of planned changes to the system and non-essential paperwork should be suspended for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis.  Stakeholder consultations are ongoing, and they will be vital to ensure that any change in circumstances can be anticipated, planned for and reacted to in a timely and comprehensive manner.<\/p><p> Just because schools are open, it does not mean there is nothing further to be done.  It is imperative that a review be undertaken, by the end of September, to assess the reopening of schools and identify improvements which may be necessary.  This review must be cross-governmental and include input from the HSA, the HSE, the inspectorate and all stakeholders.  There has to be a trusting relationship between the HSE and schools if everyone is to remain safe throughout the year.  Unless we are vigilant and in a position to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, schools may risk a second period of enforced closure.<\/p><p> Covid-19 has been a transformative experience for everyone in Irish society.  With regard to primary schools, it has shone a harsh light on years of underinvestment, the massive size of our primary classes and the inadequate spaces they inhabit.  No other European country had to issue illustrations of classrooms which were expected to accommodate up to 32 children in a class.  It has also highlighted the degree to which the system relies on the goodwill and professionalism of school leaders.  Principal teachers have taken on almost single-handedly the enormous task of managing the safe return to school of hundreds of thousands of children and staff.  School leaders must be supported, facilitated and remunerated to continue this vital work in the coming school year.<\/p><p> We need to take this opportunity to re-evaluate what is important in our society, acknowledge what are essential services and value them accordingly.<\/p><p>For our younger teachers, that is, those who graduated after 2010, this means that the scourge of pay inequality needs to be eliminated for once and for all.  Otherwise, after the Covid pandemic ends we will again see mass emigration of our brightest and best teachers overseas.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Covid-19, no one knows what will lie ahead.  However, I am proud to say that Irish primary school teachers have answered the call and responded to this unprecedented situation, often despite personal anxiety and trauma, with the professionalism, integrity and duty of care that has been their hallmark.<br\/><br\/><b>Acting Chairman (Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill):<\/b>I thank Mr. Boyle.  I ask Mr. Pike to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599001200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On behalf of the close to 20,000 non-teaching staff in schools, comprising school secretaries, caretakers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and others, including bus escorts, F&oacute;rsa trade union is pleased to have been asked to attend this meeting.  We are very much looking forward to the opportunity to engage directly with the committee on these matters.  Our opening statement covers five main areas: the position of staff with underlying health conditions; the availability and use of PPE; arrangements for attendance and testing; classroom supervision; and the use of isolation rooms.<\/p> <p>  We wish to make it clear that as the largest public service trade union in the State, F&oacute;rsa continues to support adherence to public health advice as we have done since the outset of the pandemic.  Our comments today are intended to inform debate on the optimum way to manage the pandemic and our schools within the context of the prevailing public health advice.  <\/p> <p>  The position of staff returning to school with underlying health conditions continues to cause concern.  Staff such as SNAs and bus escorts are not able to practice social distancing due to the nature of their role.  SNAs work side-by-side with students throughout the school day and bus escorts work in vehicles for several hours at a time in confined spaces where social distancing is simply not possible.  <\/p> <p>  Not all students can or will wear face coverings.  For instance, many students with additional care needs find wearing a face covering very difficult, if not impossible.  SNAs and bus escorts also provide personal intimate care for students who will not use face coverings.  Staff with underlying health conditions who have been classified as high risk should they contract Covid-19 have in many cases been advised to attend work in circumstances, despite their treating physician or specialist having advised against this.  <\/p> <p>  Some progress has been made by way of securing a review of the initial occupational health assessment.  However, we remain concerned that staff may still be directed to work side-by-side with students contrary to the HSE advice which states that those in a high-risk group should work remotely and that if they have to attend a workplace they should practice strict social distancing.  This is not possible for SNAs and bus escorts.<\/p> <p>  The Department has advised schools that a range of PPE is available and can be purchased.  This includes face visors and medical grade face masks as commonly used throughout our health and social care services on a routine basis.  Staff are now reporting that a number of schools have either refused to purchase such equipment or are requiring staff to reuse face masks contrary to HSE advice.  It is too early to be definitive as to the extent of this problem.  We intend to survey members early next week on this issue.  We can state to the committee that a significant number of staff are today providing personal care to students without adequate PPE.  The equipment in question is in plentiful supply and is inexpensive.  A medical grade face mask that provides protection against Covid-19 costs less than 50 cent.  <\/p> <p>  We support the protocols for testing students and staff and note that the HSE is developing supports for school schools with regard to rapid testing.  While we hope incidents of Covid-19 transmission in our schools we low, we believe there are advantages to conducting routine testing within our schools and universities.  The introduction of regular testing in schools would maintain confidence that a safe working environment for students and staff can be maintained and would provide a degree of certainty for the school community, including parents.  <\/p> <p>  There is one area where we believe public health advice could be reviewed, namely, the use of temperature testing.  The current advice for parents is that children should not attend school if they have certain symptoms, including a pyrexia of 38&deg;C.  To date, temperature testing has not formed part of the measures introduced to combat the pandemic.  While there has been no formal advice to schools to track temperatures, we have dealt with many queries about whether it will be required in schools and clarification would be helpful.  <\/p> <p>  Other stakeholders may wish to comment on classroom supervision as it is an issue that should only affect teaching staff.<\/p><p>F&oacute;rsa, however, is concerned that the Department's guidance and local practice may allow for special educational needs teachers to be deployed to supervise mainstream classes to cover absences.  Such practices reduce resources for students with additional care needs.  Where this takes place, SNAs are very concerned they may then be asked to supervise classes.  This is not their role, they are not qualified to supervise classes and they receive no recognition when they have to undertake such duties on instruction from a principal.  We would prefer to see a much stronger policy from the Department on this issue.<\/p><p> The use of isolation rooms for students exhibiting symptoms will without doubt be problematic.  Examples are now emerging of schools having simply no space for such a facility.  In one instance the isolation area in a school consists of a small Perspex partition hanging from the ceiling in a school secretary's office.  Difficulties are also apparent in the supervision of students awaiting collection by parents where SNAs may routinely be asked to provide this supervision, taking them away from their allocated students.  We suggest that these arrangements are reviewed to ensure that students with additional care needs are not denied access to their SNAs.<\/p><p> The reopening of our schools is of critical importance to the well-being of students, families and our society as a whole.  The efforts made by staff across the country to ensure our schools are ready to welcome back students is an example of the public service at its best and it should be recognised accordingly.<\/p><p> That concludes our opening statement.

For many years we have been looking for a nationwide supply panel scheme, as our president, Ms Magner, has just alluded to.  As of yesterday, these supply panels will be in 101 areas.  This is a massive increase on last year when there were only six supply panels.  We think it will cover in the region of 2,000 schools.  That leaves 1,250 not covered by the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Other measures have been put in place which we have welcomed.  Teachers who are job-sharing can now work nine days out of ten in their own schools.  Many teachers have taken career breaks so that they could move closer to home and now that they are closer to home they can work for the whole year as a substitute.  What we are really concerned about is the fact that young teachers cannot afford to live in the big urban areas due to pay inequality and the massive cost of rents, which have not really decreased very much during the pandemic.  These young teachers will vote with their feet and will not go to the cities.  In these instances, in an area like Dublin 15, for example, we have in excess of 1,200 primary school teachers and as of yesterday we have two supply panels there which are not covering all the schools.  We have six teachers who are supposed to be looking after up to 700 teachers, some of whom may have to be absent for up to two weeks to self-isolate.  As such it is maybe a bit early yet to say for sure but we will be demanding that that scheme be kept under review because as we get into the winter and the flu season, if more people are absent we are going to have to ensure we have cover for them.  We need to ensure that what Mr. Pike is concerned about for his members will not be happening, namely that those who are not qualified to teach and have other duties to be doing, important duties around special education, will not be asked to step in to cover classes.<\/p> <p>  With the largest class sizes in Europe, the bottom line for us is that we cannot have classes split among the remaining teachers because that totally goes against the whole premise of keeping people safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#J00500","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Can I just ask one more question about fast-tracking of testing?

People are genuinely happy to be back and kids are happy to be back with their friends but there is a degree of nervousness.

Do they have an estimate of the number of their members, at both primary and secondary level, who are considered to have a serious underlying condition?

Such people will be assigned to teach students who are also at very high risk at home.<\/p> <p>  One of the bigger problems, which I tried to mention earlier, is that there is a lack of teachers for certain subject areas at second level.  Recruitment is proving very difficult.  In a month's time, delayed retirements will hit the second level system.  We will not have the teachers to replace those retiring.  There will, therefore, be a massive shortage of teachers in the field and only a small number of teachers who are out of the field will be used to replace them.  As a result of the number of teachers to be clearly identified as being at very high risk over the coming weeks and who will not be able to teach in their schools and the coming retirements, we believe there will be a chronic shortage of teachers in some second level schools.

In some instances, four or five different consultants had advised these people not to go back to the school building.  The occupational health service, however, set a very high bar, which had been determined by Government.  People who met the conditions to be considered at very high risk would not have been going into the school even before the pandemic.  These people needed a lot of tender care from the union.

I understand that there has been some movement with the process relating to staff and that there is an appeals process.  My concern is whether the process is adequately independent and whether there will be a fresh look at existing evidence and, perhaps, a reinterpretation of it rather than simply requesting new evidence.  There is significant concern in that regard.  \"High-risk\" is a very broad term for a category that seems to take in everything from mild asthma to people with leukaemia and those at risk of liver failure.

It is not the case that we feel we are being ignored.  The week-to-week and sometimes day-to-day contact is with senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills.  On the issue of face masks, there is some confusion in respect of face coverings, which people wear to ensure they are not passing on anything to anyone else; and medical-grade face masks.  They are very cheap but are designed to the protect the wearer and to ensure there is a good degree of protection against droplet and aerosol spread.  One difficulty we have had with the Department is a reluctance on its part to issue clear advice.  We issued the advice ourselves, based on what the HSE recommends for staff providing personal care, that is, washing and changing of residents in nursing homes, and for those providing care in domestic or home settings.  It is very straightforward, namely, wear a face mask and wear a visor to protect one's eyes from splashes.  There are specific requirements around waste disposal.  If one has been washing or changing someone, any waste materials need to be bagged for 72 hours before they are put into general waste.  These are all common-sense, straightforward non-cost increasing issues.  We have found the Department to be very reluctant to address what one might call the specifics of providing care to students who have hygiene needs.  As regards PPE, maybe the term \"PPE\" is a bit frightening or disconcerting for some in the school sector but it is the basic provision of a face mask, gloves and an apron.  When people are being told to buy such equipment themselves or that the Department of Education and Skills guidance states that schools may wish to consider if they wish to provide this equipment for staff, we then have to say that the duty of care is not being maintained.  They can do a lot better than this.

That is something we simply would not tolerate.  At the moment, we are keeping a watching brief.  Covid leave is available to those who have tested positive or who are deemed to have to self-isolate but the difficulty may arise in the case of teachers who were off work for a short number of days because were that to happen regularly throughout the year, the number of absences would accumulate.<\/p> <p>  We are also worried, as I mentioned earlier, about those teachers who are pregnant and whose medical practitioners recommend that they not return to work.

We have many people who are worried and anxious and are using ordinary sick leave rather than Covid, and burning it because of this anxiety and nervousness.  That is especially the case when they see the after-effects of Covid.  Even those who are categorised as high risk or lower than high risk are nervous about returning to the classroom.  Classrooms are crowded places.<\/p> <p>  We have young adults in second level.  The media have been reporting recently, and the figures seem to back this up, that the number of people testing positive in the younger age group is rising rapidly.  These reports are creating anxiety which I believe will force staff to use sick leave.  We will then have the problem we outlined earlier because we do not have staff to support or replace these teachers and to meet the educational needs of students in schools.  In second level, it is certainly an issue with respect to the subject-specific teachers who are needed if a teacher goes out on sick leave.  If the only physics teacher in a school goes out sick, it will not be possible to get a replacement.

There is no room for isolation areas.  Some schools are using log cabins or converted and old shower rooms.  The problem with that is that if more than one student is sick - and this will occur.  In huge schools, one could have four students at the same time.  One student might have Covid, one might have hay fever, one might have a cough and there may be somebody else who does not have his homework done and does not want to be in class.  They cannot all be put in the same area.  Isolation means just one.  I am worried about that and glad that it was brought up.  <\/p><p> We have discussed space.

One of the most important aspects of the return to school is the morale of our school community.  Any threats to that should be tackled immediately.  One such threat is the issue that has emerged over the past couple of weeks related to the leaving certificate, namely, that the school rankings given out by the secondary school teachers will now be revealed to the students.  I was not aware that was going to take place when it was announced in April.  When did the secondary school unions become aware of that and what is the view of their members?<\/p><p>How has this frustration been related back to the Department?  Is it something we can address before it becomes a bigger issue next week?<\/p><p> I have a question for Mr. Andy Pike on guidelines for SNAs and potential further supports for SNAs as we move forward in the D&aacute;il term.  I want to ask about the vagueness of the guidelines.  I also want to touch on the use of face masks.  The guidance for primary schools and special schools on PPE and the use of face masks by staff states that schools should consider the specific circumstances where the use of medical face masks may be more appropriate for staff, for example, where staff such as SNAs or school bus escorts need to be in close and continued proximity to students with intimate care needs.  Is the vagueness of these guidelines a problem?  If the guidelines simply stated that staff should wear the appropriate medical mask would it alleviate some of the arbitrary decisions that have been taken from school to school, which are placing many SNAs at greater risk?<\/p><p> Medmark has already been discussed but if there are outstanding issues the unions feel need to be clarified I ask them to feel free to take some of my time to do so.  There are outstanding issues.  Is there anything Medmark needs to change or adapt in its algorithm, particularly with regard to the newly announced review system?<\/p><p> I have a question specifically for the witnesses from the TUI.  Their submitted document states that students with special educational needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot be forgotten or left behind and that customised interventions and supports may be required to reintegrate them into school.  Will the TUI witnesses speak a little about what exactly is meant by customised supports and innovations?<\/p><p> One of the stand-out parts of the ASTI presentation was that it is regrettable that those effectively making decisions on these matters refuse to meet representatives of those directly affected by them.

Through the lead worker representatives in these schools, we have clearly set out a procedure to all our members to follow if they have concerns, and they are following it.  We have had schools that have changed timetables to make sure they got 24 students into classrooms measuring 49 sq. m.  Very big classes have been divided into smaller areas or have been taught through live streaming.  If schools go through the 1:6 regime, they can solve this.  As I said, we have seen very big schools, namely, those with 1,600 pupils, managing to do so.  Where we receive a report that a school is not doing so, we tell it to get advice and call the Department's helpline, and then it should be able to do it.  Sometimes it is because the school has not pushed the last bit to get there.  We will not, however, allow our members to work in those schools where the basic precautions - such as physical distancing of in excess of 2 m, or between 1 m and 2 m when wearing masks - are not in place.<\/p><p> It is early days yet, and we may get more specific information.  We certainly heard a lot in the first day or two from teachers worried about the way in which their classrooms were laid out.  As Ms Magner stated, it was interesting that we had maps to lay out the classrooms in order that we could make sure we had 1 m social distancing in classrooms.  We have actually had to give maps to schools to make sure we know how many students can go into classrooms of various sizes.  Our classrooms are tiny.  Across Europe, 30 students go into classrooms that are nearly 100 sq. m, and our biggest classrooms are 49 sq. m.  Some of our newer buildings might contain classrooms that are up to 55 sq. m and we can put 24 students into those.  In certain countries in Europe, they put 15 students into classrooms measuring nearly 100 sq. m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gillespie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending.

We recognise that significant funding is put aside in schools in respect of sanitising and the purchase of PPE, but that does not necessarily translate into every member of staff having the benefit of that funding.  For example, there is flexibility within the funding for the purchase of different types of masks.  Our view from the beginning has been that if our members have any doubt about anything, whether returning to the workplace, having to self-isolate or what they have to wear, we advise that they wear whatever is most appropriate for them.  For example, we have teachers who are in the exact same position as the people whom F&oacute;rsa and Mr. Pike represent, namely, SNAs.  We have teachers who are looking after the intimate care needs of children with the assistance sometimes of SNAs, other times not because we may not have enough teachers or SNAs to look after special needs generally in primary.  Then there is the matter of administering first aid - responsibility for which very often just falls upon the class teacher - in trying circumstances in playgrounds or classrooms.  Our advice to our members and lead worker representatives is to demand that their boards of management provide what is available on the portal.<\/p><p>Nevertheless there will be differences with different workers and special schools.  We are really worried about the special schools sector and we are also worried about the fact that in the special school sector there are children up to the age of 18, which came up earlier.  We represent most of the members who teach there and there is not much distinction in the provision for those children on buses or in schools compared to the distinctions that are being made for students in the ordinary post-primary schools.

If there is a difficulty with accessing the Internet for learning why not put programmes onto those laptops so students can work on the exercises at night at home and bring that work in the following day?

The happy families that are contacting me are probably best epitomised by a parent of a student who is going to St. Mary's parish primary school, Bryanstown in Drogheda.  Last week there was a one-to-one between every parent and the teachers as to what was going to happen this week.  The parents, the children and the teachers were very professional, the parents and the children feel safe and there are very clear guidelines.  The professionalism of everyone involved is remarkable because this is not just a normal school year with the problems that happen in schools.

I have a constituent who is a child with special needs and requires resources.  The child has been medically assessed as having that need.  The Department has turned it down and the child is now in school.  Their parents and their medical people advise that that the child needs a full-time SNA and the Department has not given a date yet for that review in the school.<\/p><p>I ask that the unions campaign for and on behalf of children whose appeals have been delayed and whose education, therefore, has been significantly compromised.  The happiness of such children and their parents and teachers is severely challenged.<\/p><p> The other issue I will raise relates to schools which have lost teachers.  A school in my constituency, Rampark national school, had 180 students on assessment day last year but is now expected to have 170.  The school has lost two teachers leading to an unacceptable increase in the number of students in some classes.  I ask the unions to articulate the rights of students in these cases, particularly with regard to those with special needs and schools that have lost at least one teacher or, in some cases, two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#V00800","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599001200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and for his praise of teachers.

That could be very easily addressed in the budget.  If this was to be part of budget considerations in this pandemic year, it could be backdated to this September with an appeals mechanism to allow such schools to not lose their teachers immediately.  We now see the ridiculous scenario in which some of those schools that will lose a teacher in September 2020 will get that teacher, or even two teachers, back the following year if its enrolment increases.

Rural schools have not been put on what is called a supply panel.  How was the decision made to apply the panels to towns, that is, how is that 12 schools in towns were allocated three teachers whereas rural schools were not put on a panel?

Places such as Clifden, where there are many small schools, were added this week, as were Gweedore and other Gaeltacht areas.  The large urban areas are where the greatest pressure points exist.  More than 2,000 schools will be covered by the supply panels.  Obviously, we would wish that every school was covered, including the island schools, of which there are at least two on the supply panels.

To inform this submission, Inclusion Ireland conducted a short survey of 267 parents of children with disabilities on the reopening of schools.<\/p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland welcomes the reopening of schools and acknowledges the hard work of school staff over the summer period to make it happen.  It is important for children to re-engage in education and the social interactions that schools bring.  This is especially true for children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  In May this year, parents told Inclusion Ireland how home schooling was not working for their child with a disability.  Parents were working from home, they had more than one child at home and many children could not engage with education in the home.  Now, with the reopening of schools, 51.5% of parents responding to our survey report regression in their child&rsquo;s education and personal development.  This lost ground can often prove difficult, if not impossible, to make back.<\/p> <p>  The vast majority of children with disabilities - 87.5% - will, their parents report, go back to full-time education.  Some 9.5% of parents say their child will go back on a part-time basis with part-time remote learning and 3% of parents indicate their child will be engaged in full-time remote learning.<\/p> <p>  Some 80% of parents surveyed are worried about sending their children back to school during the Covid-19 period.<\/p><p>Thankfully, the level of worry in children is much less, with 54% having no concerns about returning to school.  Concerns for parents include anxiety and the risks regarding Covid-19, no social distancing on school transport and a lack of good information from the Department of Education and Skills.  Despite their obvious concerns, 86% of parents say their children will be going back to school.<\/p><p> A total of 11% of respondents to our survey reported that their children will not return to school due to high medical needs.  Our previous survey in May found that remote learning was not working for this cohort.  Inclusion Ireland raised this issue with the committee on 25 June and we have written to and met the Minister.  At present, we do not believe that satisfactory provision is in place to ensure that this very small cohort has access to appropriate education.<\/p><p> While schools are encouraged to create class bubbles, many children share SNAs who may be allocated to students in separate classrooms.  We do not believe that this has been addressed appropriately.  It must be noted that the impact of class bubbles on children with disabilities will be greater than the impact on their peers.  Parents report being told that there will be little or no access to supports such as HSE therapy services, the visiting teacher service, NEPS, assessments and special education teacher resources.<\/p><p> Inclusion Ireland is concerned that special education teachers will be used to cover absences of colleagues.  While welcome additional resources have been made available, teachers will, as a precautionary measure, have to stay off work once they display any type of cold-like symptoms.  This will place additional burdens on the substitute panel as we approach winter.  Resource teachers will be used as cover.  As we have already noted, parents are reporting regression in their children.  As we have noted, children with disabilities really need these additional supports to make up any lost ground.  HSE therapy supports and the visiting teaching service are vital educational supports for children with disabilities.  We ask the Department and its partners to look at alternative means of delivering these services to children with disabilities.<\/p><p> A total of 57% of respondents to our survey were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with communications from the Department of Education and Skills.  Parents reported that communication from schools was much better.  A number of parents commented that the Department's guidelines were so vague that schools were having difficulty working them out, especially in respect of children with disabilities.  Respondents stated that they were in the dark about school transport arrangements, sensory breaks, access to mainstream education where a child is transitioning from a special class and, with so many people in schools now wearing face masks, communication needs.<\/p><p> Inclusion Ireland acknowledges the hard work involved in schools reopening.  However, parents have expressed some concerns about their children returning to school.  Resource teachers must not be diverted from their posts.  The Department must ensure that there is adequate cover on local substitute panels.  SNAs must be allocated per class and not between classes.  If this requires additional resources, we ask that they be made available.  There must be comprehensive support guidelines for children who cannot attend school due to high medical needs or a parent's medical needs.  These should include access to the home tuition scheme if appropriate.  The Department and its partners must examine how previous external supports can be delivered, either through telehealth means or otherwise.  Many children will require access to sensory breaks and this must be accommodated within the current guidelines.  Will the Department examine whether children can continue their journey into mainstream classes from special education provision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Lynch to make a statement on behalf of the National Parents Council Primary and ask her to confine her statement to five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#KK00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599001200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The National Parents Council Primary welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the committee on the preparations for the reopening of schools and how this is operating in practice.  In making this submission, we are mindful that children have only just returned and it may be too early to fully understand their experiences and the experiences of their parents.  We issued a survey to parents in order to inform this submission and this issue was raised by a number of those who completed the survey.  The survey was open from 4 p.m. last Friday until 1 p.m. on 28 August and a total of 3,177 responses were received.  I will go through some of the headline responses from the survey, and the one I want to start with is that 93% of children who went back to school enjoyed their first day.<\/p><p>The further comments that I make are within that context.  When I was before the committee a number of weeks ago, over 90% of parents felt their children needed to go back to school.  The high percentage of children who enjoyed their first day is really reassuring and strongly reflects the work done within schools to make sure school is a positive experience for children.<\/p><p> We asked parents about school transport.  Only 8% of respondents said their children were using school transport and of that 8%, 67% were happy with the transport that was provided.  Parents raised a number of issues.  There seemed to be a mixed experience from children in regard to adhering to the new guidelines.  Sometimes the experience is different going to and returning from school.  In situations where different bus companies are involved, it is difficult to sit next to the same person.  The availability of hand sanitiser and social distancing was raised.<\/p><p> Some 82% of respondents felt they had enough information in advance of the schools opening, but 12% felt they did not.  Some 120 parents who responded to our survey said their school did not share any information with them.  That is a matter of some concern.<\/p><p> Parents reported high satisfaction generally with information from schools through many media, such as videos that schools sent to them, and text messages and emails, outlining the procedures that were in place.  That gave parents an opportunity to prepare their children for their first day back at school.  Some parents had concerns that they had received inadequate information to do this preparation with their children and some said they received information but it was only the evening or two days before their children returned to school.  Some 86% of parents said they were able to communicate with the school if they had concerns.  However, 40% said they did not have a facility to do this.<\/p><p> We provided many opportunities for parents to give individualised responses.  A number of issues came up in those responses.  One of the key concerns parents had was what happens if a class or school has to close and what provision in terms of education would be made for their children outside of school.  One of the issues with primary school is that independent learning is very difficult for children of this age.  Parents had concerns about how school closures would affect their learning.<\/p><p> Pods were an issue.  Children's happiness at being back in school was affected by whether they were with friends in pod groups and were able to play with friends at break times.  Many parents said drop-off and pick-up times worked very well but some said there were definite difficulties, in particular for those with more than one child.  A lot of respondents were concerned about parents congregating at school gates and not wearing masks. <\/p><p> Some parents feel the restrictions in schools should be looser, allowing the children to mix more.  However, other parents believe the opposite.  That is challenging for schools to manage.  A number of parents are concerned about the overuse of hand sanitiser and believe that washing hands with soap is more appropriate for young children.<\/p><p> Windows and doors being open is an issue and is causing some concern, given the Irish weather over the colder months and how this approach will work.  Some parents expressed concerns about their children in special classes.  Parents are concerned that they will not mix with mainstream classes in the way that they are used to and that their children are missing out on the essential development of social skills.<\/p><p> They are the main issues raised by parents in the survey.  As I said, it is very early days.  Some of these issues may play out differently over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lynch for her presentation and for staying within the five minutes.  I invite Ms Fanning to make her opening statement.  Again, I ask her to confine her remarks to five minutes.<\/p><p><b>Ms Mai Fanning:<\/b>The National Parents Council Post Primary is grateful for this opportunity.  The mental and physical well-being of our children has always been and remains the main focus of concern for parents.  We again emphasise the importance of fairness, equality and equity in the delivery of support for children and their families in the face of Covid-19.  This must continue to be central to the consideration and implementation of plans as our schools reopen.  All partners in education have committed to an assurance that no pupil or student will be negatively affected by the restrictions imposed due to this pandemic.<\/p><p>Full support for all schools is integral to delivery of that assurance.  We must work collectively as educators to fulfil this promise.<\/p><p> The importance of our school communities and the interactions therein to our students' well-being is long established and recognised.  There is no risk-free way to reopen our schools, but it is broadly accepted that the benefits to students being back at school are very important.  That said, parents do have some very real concerns, particularly in light of the ever-changing demands related to Covid-19 and the rapid changes that can occur as a result of trying to manage normal life alongside this pandemic.  Where such concern and potential for change exists, clear communications between all involved is essential.  The NPCPP recognises and appreciates the commitment of the Government to provide substantial funds to assist schools to reopen and is extremely grateful to individual school management and staff for their hard work and dedication in preparing schools for the safe return of students and teachers.  Parents are thankful to see our youth heading back to school, and we are certain they will endeavour to meet all the requirements demanded of them.<\/p><p> Some particular concerns have been expressed and we have asked that these be taken into consideration, acknowledged and addressed by education authorities and school management.  Each school in our educational system is autonomous and therefore different.  Each will have its own plans and will experience varying difficulties.  Prompt responses and provision of required State financial or personnel support must be available.  Likewise, assistance towards securing any additional space or infrastructure to ensure the safety of those in the whole school community must be forthcoming and promptly delivered.  Dedicated points of contact between the Department, schools and parents are vital and must be maintained.<\/p><p> While the reopening phase is particularly demanding, there will be an ongoing requirement for support in the foreseeable future.  On reopening, time must be given to inform students, and all in the school community, of the new routines being adopted at schools.  Once routines are established, day-to-day co-operation and management will become more familiar to all involved.  Procedures in the event of any suspected case or outbreak of Covid-19 in a school, including isolation requirements, should be calmly and sensitively explained to all in the school community to avoid any upset or panic should a case occur.  Prompt testing and availability of results, where necessary, must be a priority.<\/p><p> There are concerns that the necessity to wear masks, as demanded in everyday activity outside schools where personal distancing is not possible, may not be applied in school.  Transmission prevention is known to be key in the containment of the virus.  At times during the day, student movement through corridors or congregation at various pinch points may be unavoidable.  Masks should be worn at such times.  Where students are unable to wear masks for health or other reasons, required personal distancing must be applied.<\/p><p> The NPCPP wishes to emphasise the importance of support for students and families who face particular additional difficulties or disadvantage due to personal or family circumstances and for those who require additional learning support or who have special needs.  There are students who, for various reasons or in certain circumstances, may not be able to return to school or may resist returning to school.  Provision must be made to assist these students and their parents by way of support.  While the NPCPP welcomes the commitment to meet the costs of school transport where a student cannot avail of that provided, we are very aware that the most vulnerable families in our school communities will be unable to meet such costs upfront.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#LL00200","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I now open the floor to Deputies for questioning and statements.

On blended learning and our comments regarding the home tuition scheme, our previous survey was taken during the time when pupils were out of school.  We had an extensive survey with more than 1,000 respondents.  It was a fairly clear picture of the volume of children who were not able to engage with that blended learning.<\/p> <p>  What is proposed for children who cannot return to school because they are at very high risk from Covid-19 is again a similar situation of blended learning.  If the same children potentially are to be out of the school building setting for an extensive period, not just a couple of weeks or months, we propose that the children who so are identified should switch over to the home tuition scheme, which offers far more extensive one-to-one tuition of anywhere between ten and 20 hours depending on the age of the child.  What is currently proposed under the continuity of schooling report given to schools early last week is that a teacher would be appointed to the individual child who is unable to return to the school building.  While there is a framework there, we do not feel it would be anywhere near enough to just have remote-style tuition on a highly intermittent basis for children who cannot return to school for medical reasons.<\/p> <p>  That guidance also does not cover children who are at high risk and or indeed those who may have a parent or sibling who is at very high risk.  That continuity of support for children in the home setting is only for children who are at very high risk themselves and the document clearly states that no other circumstances will be considered and it only applies to those pupils.  As such, we do have a number of families where there is a child with disabilities who is at very high risk and is remaining at home and we believe that the proposals are less than satisfactory, particularly for those with very complex needs.  In the document appendix, some samples are provided.  The first three relate to children in mainstream school settings and special class settings and are focused on the teaching intervention being proposed.  When it comes to the child in a special school setting where there are more complex needs, it reverts to measures such as alleviating any issues in the home setting around behaviour and frustration and does not really engage with their educational input.  It is more about what can be done to alleviate things for the child at home.  We consequently have major concerns that children in that very high-risk cohort that cannot attend school and who have complex disabilities will simply be managed, as opposed to educated, during that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#NN00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey.

From my own knowledge, in the case of some of the schools in my own constituency and our own school as well, videos and text messages were very helpful and Ms Lynch referred to this in her own remarks.

Seeing the school, how to enter and leave it and what the classrooms and pods would look like was very reassuring.  Families who did not get this information said they would have liked to have received such support because its absence added to their child's anxiety on the first day.  It was also an anxious time for children just starting primary school because normal things such as visits to the school before attending and parents going in with them on the first day were all very restricted.

With everybody else here, I welcome the opening of schools and I hope that they will remain open.  We all know the impact the closure of schools had on many pupils.  In many cases, students with special educational needs were disproportionately impacted by these closures.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the lack of information pertaining to children with special educational needs in the roadmap for the reopening of schools.  There should have been a link with child development teams or the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, within the roadmap but that was not the case.  A lot of therapies normally offered to children, such as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, were not offered during the period of the Covid closures or were only offered in a very limited fashion.  In other years a transitional report would have been prepared with the student who was transitioning from primary school to secondary school and with the child development team.  This helped prepare students for that transition and showed parents how to support them.  This proved invaluable to schools.  Are the witnesses aware of whether such reports were prepared with students this year?  I believe they were not although I am open to correction.  I hope I will be corrected on that.  The report might include things as simple as where lockers should be located or that timetables should be colour-coded.  Those things are very important, especially for children who have autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  Will therapies now be offered on a regular basis, as they were before?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#OO00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599001200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Families and their children experienced a massive reduction in the availability of, and access to, professionals who deliver therapeutic interventions for children over the last few months.  It is well known that the HSE had to redeploy a great number of staff to Covid swabbing centres.  These staff included speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.  These are the people who need to work directly with our children.  While I am aware that returning these people to their posts is a priority, in certain areas it has been communicated that further staff may need to be redeployed to swabbing, particularly in areas where Covid is deemed to be on the rise.  There is conflict between getting those well-trained professionals back to their posts working with children in schools and homes and carrying out such transition planning, and the need for the health service to react to Covid.  At a previous committee meeting in June we said that, in whatever planning the HSE carried out, it needed to look at a permanent workforce relating to Covid to allow therapists do what they do best, which is to support our children.<\/p> <p>  On the transition plans which would normally be prepared in the early part of the year in which a child is moving from preschool to primary school or from primary school to post-primary school and on plans for school-leavers with disabilities, there was major disruption regarding the ability to contact teams, where a child had a team to provide such supports.<\/p><p>Schools have transition passports so information around a child's needs may have been provided directly by the parents, not necessarily by a health professional.  There is a good passport for children with disabilities who are in receipt of access and inclusion model support when they transition from pre-school to primary school.  That end was covered whether or not the related professional reports accompanied the passports and at least the teachers of junior infants would be well aware of the needs and strengths of the child coming into the classroom.  <\/p><p> There was considerable disruption to the profiling process for children transitioning from schools to adult services.  I know that we are talking about third level, further education, announcements and leaving certificate examinations but a large cohort of children who have left school this year face major disruption in their passage to what they will do in the course of the next few years and that needs to be addressed at another committee session.<\/p><p> There are existing waiting lists but we are looking for an increase in the number of available therapy staff to support schools.  I believe the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has managed to find a way around the redeployment of therapists with which it had engaged and has sanctioned the direct hiring of an additional 31 therapists.  That one's resource can be taken away and used for something else shows that the system is not working during Covid-19.  <\/p><p> In considering supports for children in schools, the education sector needs to look at directly providing special speech and language therapy.  Getting teams back together is essential for continuity.

First, there are many different media and given that schools are autonomous, the information is best coming from the schools to the parents.  The key in communications is that it is ongoing and that the language used is clear.  Quite a lot of the information that comes through to the school is not in language that a parent may be familiar with.  That information has to be translated by the school so that the parents, students and children understand what is going on.<\/p> <p>  In our submission and in general terms we have spoken about the early weeks of going back to school.  This is brand new for us all.  I refer to the understanding of routine, the gaining of knowledge for each pupil, what each pupil requires and what pupils' needs are as they move into the school.  This is a critical period during which the schools, parents and children all have to work together.  It is worth taking time at the start, even at the risk of not covering some of the academic side, to get to know exactly what each student needs and ensure the two-way communication is understood and delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#QQ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Rolston"},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>As I have five minutes, I will do this in two parts if that is okay.  First, I will address Inclusion Ireland.  It seems to me, and the previous survey presented to the committee demonstrated this, that children with special educational needs and intellectual disabilities were among those who suffered most due to the schools being closed, despite the best efforts of everyone.  From talking to parents and children, it seems the lack of access to schools during the lockdown was extremely difficult.  It is vitally important that these categories of children are prioritised.  Very often, these children have not been a priority for the Department of Education and Skills.  If ever there was a time for children with special educational needs to be a priority, it is now.<\/p> <p>  The roadmap presents some significant difficulties.  The first point that occurs to me concerns children who are in units.<\/p><p>There is a lack of clear guidance from the NCSE and the Department on a number of issues, including face coverings, but also units.  In some instances, principals are asking children and families to choose between the unit and the mainstream class.  Being in the unit reduces the value of the inclusion and integration with the main class unit.  If they are to go into the mainstream class, it to some extent undermines the argument for the unit.  That should not be the case because access to both is needed.<\/p><p> I have another question for Inclusion Ireland.  Deputies are hearing concern from constituents over school transport.  There are issues with school transport for students with special educational needs.  Very often there is a lack of access to taxis.

I do not know what the solution is.  As our colleague has mentioned, each school is autonomous and different situations arise in each school.  The information coming from the Department is certainly not up to standard.<\/p> <p>  School transport is an issue, especially for children with special educational needs.

There is a divergence in planning.  Some areas have recognised that having pupils from two special schools sharing one bus leads to the potential risk of two school closures if there is an outbreak and have managed to adjust the routes separating those two school buses.  There is a particular issue in rural areas in getting taxi support where no actual bus route is in place and where they cannot get a taxi to serve that route, which leaves the parent having to bring that child significant distances to school.  We are not talking about half an hour.  We are talking about 100 km or more in some instances.  They have been well documented in previous committee meetings.  Parents are concerned about the social distancing particularly with the cohort on the special school transport who in the main cannot wear any form of face covering, leaving them more open to risk.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Lynch mentioned earlier, children going to school may not necessarily be on the same special school transport vehicle on the way back, which mixes it all up again.

The junior infant children have never experienced anything other than going into school and their parents not coming in with them. The difficulty, and I speak from personal experience, is more for the parent than the child on the junior infant side.  <\/p> <p>  It is, however, a different thing for children going into fourth or fifth class who are more socially aware and on whom the long break has more significant psychosocial impacts.  When Ms Lynch was here earlier in the year - I believe it was it late May or early June - we talked about the importance of how the children were going back to school as much as when they were going back.  We spoke about the emotional resilience and emotional support they would need to cope with coming back, re-establishing their peer networks, coping with a new physical environment and, indeed, anything that has been going on at home for them in the interim.

Schools have put a huge focus on the mental health and well-being of children.  There are difficulties that are almost insurmountable at junior infant level because parents cannot physically go into the classroom.  Schools were doing a lot around videos before they went in and there has been much communication with parents.  However, many supports have been put into schools around that fourth and fifth class issue.  Much direction has been given to schools about the engagement of children back into the school with their peers and working through the experiences they have had over the past six months rather than through the curriculum.  The 93% of children who enjoyed their first day is a reflection on how that has been taken up and supported by schools and we hope that will continue.  We need to constantly be vigilant for children who are struggling with that.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has put many supports into schools for either groups of children or individual children who are having a particularly hard time reintegrating back into school.  Tusla is also looking at that as well.  They need to continue and we need to keep a close eye.  It is still early days, though, so we may not yet be aware of some of the issues that might come up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#SS00700","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1599001200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>It may take a couple of weeks for any child to settle back in, particularly this year.  From a practical perspective at post-primary level, the absence of lockers and having to carry big, heavy books and also, perhaps, some gym gear or equipment for practical classes or whatever it may be, all adds to the anxiety of managing a day and managing it differently as well.  Some of the videos have been helpful.  I do not know about other members of the committee but I have seen few videos that have been targeted at children other than videos of the new school arrangement, or walking on this or the other side of the corridor.  The actual experience of a child coming in, sanitising his or her hands and wondering where he or she can put his or her stuff can generate significant anxiety for a 14 or 15 year old.<\/p> <p>  With the time I have left I want to raise, in particular, from the perspective of parents, the drop-off and collection arrangements.  When Ms Lynch was here before I asked her and the Department about looking at this from the perspective of parent and sibling coordinated drop-offs rather than class drop-offs.  If we are concerned about the management or congregation of parents around the school and the impact on risk for community transmission in that way, then minimizing the hanging around may alleviate that.  One might have one child who is collected an hour early or another child who is collected 40 minutes early from the same family, or three children in three different classes.

The area where things are falling down is in miscommunication to parents.  Schools, within themselves, are working hard to communicate with the parental and student body.  If, however, schools are not getting the information they require to clarify matters, they cannot pass it on.<\/p> <p>  There are some grey areas.  I acknowledge that it is still early days for secondary schools because many of them have not yet fully kicked in.  There have been sort of lead-in days for different classes and some of them will not kick in full time for another week or two.  Grey areas have come up, however, and one of the main ones is that children who are classed as at risk because of a medical condition, but not at high risk, are in a dichotomy at the moment where they cannot go back to school because they are at risk.

The key areas for us are supporting schools to have adequate resources to support additional needs for children with special needs that might have been compounded by the extensive period at home.  That would involve looking at the whole school profile in respect of making amendments to it for the allocation of special education teachers and SNAs.  We feel that it can be challenging enough at times, but especially in a context where there may be ongoing issues for some children settling back into school because of leftover changes in behaviours, that challenge or otherwise.  Where schools identify a need for those additional supports, there should be a quick response.<\/p> <p>  Ms Fanning reiterated the issue of those at very high risk and the plans for supporting them at home.  The Department currently has no plans to support children in the high-risk medical group at home.  They are expected to attend school.  Even if those children are given a medical instruction to stay at home but they are at high risk, the document is not clear on the guidelines regarding whether the Department would step in and have that continuity of schooling programme open to them.  There is no indication as to what will happen in the case of children who have another family member at very high risk, whether a parent or a sibling.  This is happening already.  Families are having to make extremely hard decisions concerning their children, particularly at second level, who may not be going back to school because either a sibling or parent is at very high risk and there are concerns about the potential to bring infection back into the home, with catastrophic results.<\/p><p>Other than engaging with Tusla, it does not seem there is any proposal for those children to engage in continuing education.  There is psychological damage to the child who may not want to put their family member at risk.  There is also an educational issue for them in that, without standard provision being made in the plan for them, those children will be at home.  They will not have access to home tuition.  The proposal is not that the parents want to engage in home schooling.  They want their children to maintain contact with the school but that should be formalised rather than what we hear now, which is that it is left up to individual schools.  <\/p><p> In terms of additional supports from NEPS, those teams would be scaffolding around the schools, whether coming from NCSE or children's disability network teams, to ensure there is enough capacity there and that the schools feel supported in addressing any challenges that children with disability may have, which were compounded over the past six months. <\/p><p> Regarding parents who may be unable to return to employment, particularly if the child is in the very high risk category, there is no allowance for them other than to take permanent leave from their employment, with catastrophic economic consequences to the family unit.  These people are having to make decisions.  They might have term contracts according to which they were at home during the summer but they are expected to turn up to work this week and, unfortunately, they cannot.

Speaking from the perspective of special education, some situations need a little more teasing out and, in our opinion, some situations have not been fully considered.  We have already mentioned young people transitioning from special education to mainstream education who spend part of their day in both.  We have already mentioned the SNAs hovering between two or three classes, where each class is meant to be a bubble.  The issue we feel has not been addressed adequately is that of children with complex disabilities and medical needs.  Many of these children will not be back in school any time soon.  We do not believe the Department's guidelines will allow them adequate access to a full education.  In our previous survey in May, parents were clear that what their children needed was access to a highly skilled teacher and that they, as parents, were not in a position to provide this education.  We would like to see a little bit more thought put into this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020090200002#WW00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599001200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>From the point of view of the primary sector, the Department has issued huge amounts of information, guidance and support to schools and parents in recent months in an ever shifting environment, which has been extremely challenging.

It highlights that parents report having no access to supports such as the HSE therapies, services in schools, the visiting teacher service or NEPS services.  We have spoken about NEPS services before.  I did some informal work on this with local schools in Waterford and was appalled, to be frank, by the waiting times for the educational assessments and the fact that only a couple of assessments were being offered to individual schools each year.

Sometimes they are referred to the HSE to try some way of getting a similar type of assessment done.<\/p><p>As such it is an existing problem insofar as the child is missing out on six months of school during which assessments may normally have been carried out and there may be a delay there to children.  It is also important to note that the engagement with children who display additional needs in school in respect of their educational input should not be delayed by waiting on a NEPS assessment.  As there is a whole-school model of allocating special educational teaching supports, they no longer need a particular diagnosis to access additional teaching supports; it should be there and upfront.  However, in particular where children require a diagnosis for a particular type of support, there are still issues surrounding that, which the education system itself has to work through.<\/p><p> When it comes to providing psychological support to a school, I understand that NEPS has provided a lot of material to schools to provide generalised support to the whole school.

In interactions with the Department and the Minister, we will be looking for that broader model of support for children with all types of disabilities to be extended to the summer of 2021.  It would not only apply to the extended school year for post-primary students.  It would be appropriate to have that educational input but there is also a need for social and psychological supports and the ability to provide students with a programme that is educational, social and sporting over the summer period whereby students are not just restricted to having access to a teacher but also to an SNA where that is more appropriate.  We should aim to give parents that choice again.  As Mr. O'Connor said, silence suggests success.

Previous speakers spoke about the complications presented by Covid, but it is my experience that this issue was prevalent long before the arrival of Covid.  I have a letter I received from the HSE on 13 July this year concerning a constituent of mine.  The case concerns a ten-year old boy who was referred to the child development team of the HSE in February 2016 by Enable Ireland.  He received a diagnosis of developmental co-ordination disorder from Enable Therapy Services in August 2017.  This young boy needs support from the child development team psychotherapy services.  The case dates back to 2016.  The information I received in July is that the current waiting time for psychotherapy intervention is extensive but the service would make contact with the family as soon as an appointment becomes available.  You can imagine, Chairman, if you were the parent of that child and that is the clarification you received about a child who needed support from 2016.<\/p> <p>  This child also needs support from the occupational therapy service.  Again, there is an acknowledgement that the child was referred to the child development team in 2016 and that he is currently on the occupational therapy waiting list for intervention.  No date has been given, but there is an indication that there may be an appointment within the next three months.  The child also needs to meet the psychology services staff.  That goes back to September 2015 when a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder was made.  Since that time he has been on the waiting list for psychological services.  He received the psychology input from the primary care team and received a psychology appointment with the child development team in 2017.  He was then placed on a high-priority waiting list for individual psychological work but he is still waiting.<\/p> <p>  That is a scandalous legacy issue pertaining to a child with special needs and I know of countless other cases.  My question is directed in particular to the representatives of Inclusion Ireland.  Is that type of scenario particular to my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan or is it generally prevalent and is there any indication of exactly how many children are in that position?
