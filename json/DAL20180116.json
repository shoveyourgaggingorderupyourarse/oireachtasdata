The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine reasonably asked how many more patients would have to die needlessly while inertia prevailed.  This is in a context in which it is estimated that 350 to 400 deaths per year are directly attributable to emergency department overcrowding.<\/p><p>This situation is interesting, given what happens in Scotland and England.  In Scotland, just 6% of patients waited for longer than four hours.  In Ireland, 19% of patients waited for longer than nine hours, which is a considerable difference.  In England, commentators describe people waiting longer than four hours as a shocking lapse.  Ms Susan Mitchell recently put it well in her article in the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>, which stated: &quot;What passes for inexcusable in Britain would represent a huge improvement for the Irish health system.&quot;<\/p><p>Three years ago, the Taoiseach as Minister for Health said that he was &quot;sick to death&quot; of the problem and that he would solve it once and for all.  He referenced a long-term plan to solve it.  Three years on and that plan has never materialised.<\/p><p>As we know, the situation has become much worse since that announcement by the Taoiseach.  This reflects a continuing unacceptable approach, a fundamental lack of urgency in respect of this issue and, sometimes, an attempt to normalise it.  The toleration threshold relating to people waiting in accident and emergency departments is simply unacceptable and too high.  The level of complacency is shocking.<\/p> <p> In terms of some of the Government's own metrics and targets, the capital provision is woefully inadequate and does not provide for any meaningful response to the awaited bed capacity review.  On the GP contract talks, we have been told for the past two or three years that something would materialise but it has not.  Nothing is happening.  Community intervention teams have not been established and providing diagnostics in the community is another aspiration.  There is a lack of home support and so on and the crisis is all round.  The budget is passed in October and the HSE's service plan is published in late December.  There is an absence of transparency in the lead up to the budget.  The Government takes it on trust that adequate provision will be made for acute services but that never materialises.<\/p> <p> Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government did not adequately prepare for the current crisis and that this is why there were record numbers on trolleys, which caused enormous distress to people throughout the country?  Will he confirm that real, meaningful funding will be provided to underpin the recommendations of the bed capacity review in terms of extra beds in 2018?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I would like to start by welcoming everyone back to the House after the December and January recess.  I also want to begin by paying tribute to Dolores O'Riordan who died yesterday.  For so many of us, especially those of us who grew up in the 1990s, she was the voice of a generation.  No matter where one was in the world in recent times, it would not be long before one heard a Cranberries song on the radio, even in the most far-flung places.  Dolores blazed a trail across the world with her unique voice and song-writing talent.  Our thoughts are with her children, family, friends and the people of Limerick in particular.

We expect that number to fall throughout the day, as it usually does, to approximately 250.  It is important to say that two thirds of people who attend an emergency department are through it within nine hours.  In other words, from the time that he or she registers, a patient is either in a hospital bed or discharged home within nine hours.  That is the experience for two thirds of patients but, of course, the experience for many others is much worse and can sometimes involve prolonged periods spent in emergency departments or on trolleys while waiting for beds.  That is something I do not seek to defend in the House today because it is not defensible.<\/p>  <p>  If this was simply a matter of political will or finance, we would have resolved this problem a long time ago.

That is particularly obvious when one considers that there has been an almost 20% increase in health funding in the past three years.  The population has increased and there are now more older people here.  There has also been pay restoration but certainly not in the region of 20%.  Depending on whose figures one accepts, funding for our health service puts Ireland in the top six or top three in the world on a <i>per-capita<\/i>basis.  As a doctor who worked for seven years in our health service, including in emergency departments, as a former Minister for Health, as a politician who represents tens of thousands of constituents and as somebody who has elderly relatives who, on occasion, have had to spend time on hospital trolleys, I can say that the Government is doing everything it can to alleviate both the short-term and longer-term issues involved.  I do not want any citizen to face the indignity or the clinical risk that comes with a prolonged stay on a hospital trolley.<\/p><p>In terms of what is being done, the Cabinet discussed this matter in detail last week.  We are going to continue to press ahead with increasing our hospital bed capacity - increasing the number of acute beds in our system.<\/p><p>That is under way already.  Almost 200 new beds have come into the system in the last year.  The number of beds in the system increased in the previous year as well.  The Minister for Health will bring the bed capacity review to the Cabinet before the end of the week.  We have approved the resumption of talks with GPs on a new contract.  Obviously, it takes two to tango.  We are very keen to have the new contract agreed this year in order that implementation can begin.  The position of director of health service reform, as head of the Sl&aacute;intecare office, was advertised on Friday.  I hope we get good applicants for that position.<\/p> <p> We want a particular focus on mainstreaming best practice across our health service because there are huge variations.  Hospitals like Beaumont Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Connolly Hospital, Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda have seen considerable reductions in hospital overcrowding.  Interestingly, figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation for the eastern region show that last year, overcrowding across the hospitals in Dublin and Naas was at its lowest level since records began, even though there has been a big increase in population and in ageing in that region.  There are huge variations across hospitals.  I suggest that in the future, we should place a greater focus on mainstreaming best practice where it occurs in the health service, as it often does.  We need to make sure best practice is mainstreamed.  We need to ensure additional resources are put into rewarding good performance and best practice.  We should not always put more resources into systems that do not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600004#B00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":14,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I would like an opportunity on the Order of Business to pay tribute to Dolores O'Riordan.

Some 1,600 extra beds were provided between 2000 and 2005.  That occurred under my watch.  Contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Harris, has been saying on the radio, there was massive investment in acute hospitals at that time.  I will leave that to one side because people are interested in the issues we are facing here and now.<\/p>  <p>  I will explain why I have said there is a lack of urgency.  Last summer, Letterkenny University Hospital made a submission to the HSE and the Government for an extra 20 beds at a cost of &euro;1.8 million.  It did this last summer so that it would be ready for Christmas and the winter initiative.  It did not receive a reply.  Deputy McConalogue raised the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, and as a topical issue, but no action was taken.  As a result, there are 36 people waiting on trolleys at the hospital for admission today.  Last week, Letterkenny University Hospital had the unenviable claim of having the highest number of people on trolleys - 45 - which is an illustration of how chronic this issue is.  I understand there were 2,000 people on trolleys at the hospital in 2016.  According to Deputy McConalogue, that figure increased to 5,000 in 2017.  The hospital had a solution and it made a submission, but it did not receive a response.  When Deputy Kelleher raised this matter at the health committee some months ago, he was assured that things would be looked after and that we would not have record numbers of people on trolleys.  We are beating those records every year.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and his Fine Gael colleagues have been in government for seven years.  It is about time they took responsibility for their time in government in respect of issues like this.  The failure to respond to cases like Letterkenny resulted in the exacerbated crisis we witnessed this Christmas.  There are other examples across the country of submissions being made to the Minister in plenty of time.  Hospitals sought funding to try to alleviate the worst of the crisis but they simply were not responded to.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, were alerted to the Letterkenny submission but there was no response to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Funding for Letterkenny University Hospital has increased from &euro;94 million five years ago to &euro;121 million this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am talking about capital provision for beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Its budget has increased by almost &euro;30 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":20,"content":"<p>What about the 20 beds and the 36 people on trolleys today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C00800","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":21,"content":"<p>We need to have a health service in which such a level of increase in funding and investment results in better outcomes for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C00900","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":22,"content":"<p>That is not the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C01000","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":23,"content":"<p>If that does not happen, we will continue to do more of the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C01100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Is that a threat to close wards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C01200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":25,"content":"<p>We know that more of the same does not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600005#C01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The Government controls the HSE.

The Taoiseach has often said he welcomes constructive proposals from the Opposition.  On 6 December last year, when I put to him a modest, costed proposal to increase respite care services, he committed to examine it.  I also sent him a detailed copy of my proposal in writing, but he has yet to respond to me.  One week after I made my proposal, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced that he had secured an additional &euro;10 million for respite care services.  As I told the Taoiseach many times, there are no emergency services and only a limited number of respite care beds in my constituency of Louth.  While the Minister of State's announcement was presented in part as an urgent response to this issue, it has since emerged that the additional funding is grossly inadequate and a task force to examine the matter has not yet met.  In most cases, this involves citizens in a family setting.  However, it has emerged that children with a disability who are in the care of the State are being denied respite care facilities.  <\/p>  <p>  An investigation by the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, has found that the State has been denying the necessary supports to a woman who has been fostering for 14 years Molly, a teenager with Down's syndrome and severe autism.  Molly's carer accused the Health Service Executive and Tusla of abandoning her and leaving her financially, emotionally and physically drained.  The Ombudsman for Children found the HSE had abdicated its responsibility to Molly's foster mother by refusing to fund respite care for her.  As I am sure the Taoiseach knows, this has caused horrific stress.  The report of the Ombudsman for Children is damning.  It found that the State's actions had a negative effect on Molly who did not have the opportunity to reach her full potential and that the actions of the State were contrary to fair and sound practice.  There are 472 children, including Molly, with disabilities in the care of the State.  Among his recommendations, the Ombudsman for Children calls for a respite care action plan for children with a disability in the care of the State and the community at large.  While these recommendations have been accepted by the HSE and Tusla, the former has pointed out that its commitment in this area is ultimately resource dependent, in other words, it is now over to the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  This is not another shameful, historical episode of neglect or ill treatment of children in the care of the State.  It is occurring now and we will not be able to blame anybody else if it continues because it is taking place on our watch.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the report is damning?  Does he accept its recommendations and will he provide the resources needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600006#D00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1516112700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Government decided this morning that we would not oppose the Sinn F&eacute;in motion on hospital overcrowding.

We responded in kind, which is more important, by providing an extra &euro;10 million for respite care services in the year ahead.<\/p><p>Later this year we will also provide a statutory right for all those in receipt of carer's allowance to see their general practitioner for free.  This comes on top of our decision last year to provide all children with a severe disability with a full medical card as a statutory right for the first time.<\/p> <p> I was asked about the report on the case of Molly.  Tusla and the HSE accept the Ombudsman for Children's report in full and are committed to implementing its recommendations.  I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, with whom I discussed the matter this morning and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, take the findings very seriously.  The investigation highlights a gap in the provision and co-ordination of supports and services by Tusla and the HSE for children in foster care with a diagnosed moderate or severe disability.  We all respect and value the role of foster carers, particularly foster parents who take on children with special needs, additional needs or disabilities.  The report published by the Ombudsman for Children on the complaint which was made in 2014 by a foster carer on behalf of her foster daughter is of real concern to the Government.  Action is already under way, including a review of the supports available to Molly and monitoring her care to ensure her needs will be met into the future.  Furthermore, Tusla and the HSE are reviewing all similar cases of children with moderate or severe disabilities who are in foster care with a view to maximising the level of co-ordination, co-operation and support.  There must be many other Mollys and we want to ensure the State agencies will review all similar cases.  <\/p> <p> We must continue to support foster carers who, like Molly's family, have opened their homes to children who cannot live with their own families.  As I mentioned prior to Christmas, we provided an additional &euro;10 million for respite care services to support people with disabilities throughout the State and their carers.  A joint working protocol has been agreed between Tusla and the HSE.  It has been in place since last  year and is to ensure Tusla and the HSE will work more closely together.  However, it only came into effect on 1 January this year, only a number of days ago.

It is a sad reflection on our society that news of hundreds of sick people on trolleys is no longer shocking.  According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, there are 541 people on trolleys, 413 in emergency departments and a further 128 on wards today.  Last year almost 100,000 people spent at least one night on a trolley.  That is a shocking number.  Our hospitals are operating at an occupancy rate of 95%, which is well above international safe levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has almost perfected the management of the news cycle as this annual crisis erupts.  There are many myths about the trolley crisis and many proposed solutions.  I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that it is important that we do not talk down our health service.  There are real problems that we need to resolve.  Immense work is being done every day and every night in our hospitals treating sick people.  Our population is growing.  It is ageing and health problems have become more complex.  Diseases that once killed are now being managed and new solutions are being provided to manage complicated illnesses.  Progress is being made.  Our health service staff are national heroes who save lives every day and we have much to be proud of but we must address the problems.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has perfected the line that it is not a matter of money or resources and we heard that again today.  At the heart of the trolley crisis is a lack of capacity and staff and to solve that requires money.  Government makes choices and its choice in the last budget was to provide tax cuts rather than to move every cent we had into addressing the crises we face.  We should have almost 4,000 consultants but we have fewer than 3,000.  Everybody is in agreement that we also need more acute hospital beds.  A bed capacity review is still awaited but the number of beds needed has been estimated from up to 9,000, or at a minimum 2,500, over the next ten years if the Sl&aacute;intecare project agreed in this House is to be implemented.  <\/p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach's plan and what is the actual target to hire more doctors in the coming 12 months?

I am also shocked that it has taken and is taking so long to resolve it.  The figure of 100,000 the Deputy gives does not refer to people who spent the night on a trolley.  That is a count done at 8 a.m. and could include people on a trolley for fewer than nine hours, maybe even one hour or two hours.  The figures collated by the INMO by its own explanation, on its website, include patients who are not on trolleys but are in the wrong sort of bed in, for example, an overflow ward or a unit that should have 12 beds but now has 14 and so on.  As more categories of patients are added to that count inevitably the number will go up.

We also saw the difficulties in Limerick arising from the closures in Ennis and Nenagh.  It is not that it was the wrong thing to do.  Clinically, it was the right thing to do.  However, one needs to make sure the new central hospitals have adequate capacity to deal with the additional patient loads and evidently they do not.

The town of Cashel now boasts that it has the invaluable service provided by two special schools, Scoil Chormaic and Scoil Aonghusa.<\/p><p>Some 320 special needs pupils from all over County Tipperary and parts of the bordering counties of Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork, Limerick and Offaly attend both schools.<\/p> <p> Scoil Aonghusa is experiencing a major crisis at present.  A child attending the school will have little or no speech and may never acquire it.  He or she will find it very difficult to learn new skills and will need support with daily activities such as mobility, toileting, eating, dressing, washing and keeping safe.  The children have health problems including seizures and dietary and digestive issues.  They have sensory issues such as visual impairment and-or hearing impairment.  They have psychiatric conditions and difficulties with social skills.  Without a doubt, these are some of the most vulnerable children in our society, yet there is shameful neglect and under resourcing of special schools.<\/p> <p> Scoil Aonghusa has 97 students with intellectual, physical and huge complex needs in a building which is totally unfit and unsuitable.  It was originally built in 1985.  Some 80% of the students are non-verbal, 30% are physically disabled and 50% present with varying degrees of aggressive and destructive challenging behaviour, with the ability to cause injury to themselves and others.  Due to overcrowding, four classrooms have been rented from an adjacent property.  Some 19 junior ASD pupils have to be transported on a daily basis from the school to another rented building in the town, which is a mile away.  Ten students, who have life-limiting conditions, are sharing a classroom which was built for six.  There is no proper PE hall or assembly area.  There is one changing facility in the school with a hoist for the needs of the children.  There is no longer a dining room because it has been turned into a classroom.  The children are eating in their classrooms.<\/p> <p> Traffic congestion is a huge issue.  The area is an accident waiting to happen.  It is chaotic because 27 buses use the only entrance to the school building to enter and exit twice daily.  Some 60 staff enter and exit through the same entrance.  A boxroom is called a doctor's consultation area, but it is simply too small and unfit for purpose.  The school is relying on the generosity of staff, parents and friends of the school to fundraise in order to meet the small shortfall from the Department.  Parents have told us of their frustration, desperation and sense of isolation due to the fact that their special children cannot access adequate supports and services.<\/p> <p> Children with special needs in our society do not have a voice.  Scoil Aonghusa, on behalf of its pupils, is appealing to the Taoiseach to intervene and recognise the ongoing crisis it is living with on a daily basis.

In fact, resources grew throughout the recession and continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Department targets policies and supports for students with special educational needs to support their participation and progression across the continuum of education.  For example, last year the Department of Education and Skills invested &euro;1.78 billion in the special education budget, which is now almost a fifth of the entire education budget and is more than we invest in higher education.  There has been a 44% increase since 2011, when the change of Government occurred.<\/p>  <p>  The number of special needs assistants increased during the same period by 32%, from 10,575 to 13,990.

This is because we cannot have a situation whereby there are children looking into empty fields and not having schools to go to at all.  A huge amount of the budget is now being taken up by building new schools, very often in rapidly expanding areas where there are new families and no schools at all.  That has to be the priority.

Could he explain why it is necessary for each speaker to have 20 minutes?  My understanding is that both the Chief Whip and the Minister for Health contacted the business office to seek a doubling of the time allocated.  I also understand that every Deputy in this House is entitled to speak for 20 minutes.  That would effectively allow for 52.3 hours of debate on the joint committee's report if every Deputy wanted to use his or her 20 minutes.  It just does not make sense.

We are awaiting advice from the Attorney General on that issue because we would find ourselves in a very strange position if we were to repeal the eighth amendment only to find that there were other rights to life in other parts of the Constitution that might make any legislation we would pass unconstitutional.  We have to obtain the Attorney General's advice on that issue.

It is a pity the Minister for Health has left.  Mary Street Medical Centre in Clonmel is a fine facility and has excellent diagnostic equipment.  The Minister visited the centre and saw this with his own two eyes.  After three years, the HSE gave the centre a 14-day contract to carry out diagnoses.  That worked to relieve the numbers waiting on trolleys in South Tipperary General Hospital but, after eight days, the HSE pulled the contract, despite two and a half years of negotiations and even a visit from the Minister.  That is the kind of incompetence that is going on in the HSE and why we have what we have.  The Taoiseach need not be shocked at all because he is a former incumbent in the Department and he should know all about the trolley crisis.  The medical centre in question has the capacity and an excellent team of doctors and staff connected to University Hospital Limerick to read scans, which would keep people away from the emergency department.

The right to belong to a trade union is a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations and the European Union and can only be realised through collective bargaining between employers and unions.  However, a right is not a right unless it is recognised as such in law.  This State has a voluntary system of collective bargaining.  While that has brought some benefits and works in certain circumstances, it does not work for everyone, including employees of companies that do not accept or recognise the trade unions involved.  There have been too many examples of large and profitable companies not recognising trade unions and dictating to their workforces who should or should not represent them.  That is not fair.  In a court case, it would be like an opponent having a veto over who should represent the other side.  We would not tolerate that in a legal scenario and we should not tolerate it in the world of industrial relations.<\/p><p>We have good industrial relations machinery in the State and some moves have been made in recent times to ensure that all sides are at least involved in any mediation or court hearing on achieving resolutions.  However, a worker should have the right not only to join a trade union, as is the case currently, but to be represented by that trade union.  Trade unionists are skilled people who can represent those who are not in a position to represent themselves or do not have the means to employ barristers, solicitors and so on.  After people join trade unions and pay fees, trade union representatives give them the support they need if and when a conflict arises in the workplace.<\/p><p>We must bring ourselves into line with the majority of states in the EU and around the world in ensuring that workers not only have the right to join a trade union, but to bargain collectively and be represented by their trade unions.<\/p><p>Too many Bills on workers' rights that we have introduced have been knocked back by the Government.  As an Teachta Adams stated, this and the previous Taoiseach always said that they wanted solutions from the Opposition but, when we provided any, they would not accept what was progressive, relevant and necessary legislation on protecting workers because they did not like it or were ideologically opposed to workers' rights.<\/p><p>Before I hand over to my colleague, an Teachta Munster, to conclude, I call on the Government to support this Bill when we move it in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600017#P03500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>A successful employment rights infrastructure is one that operates on the basis of equality and a level playing field between workers and their employers.  One cannot claim to support the right of workers to collectively bargain if one does not support the right to trade union recognition because both are inextricably linked.  This Bill will give practical effect to the right of workers to be represented by a trade union.  It will make it a legal right that must be respected by employers.  The current voluntary system works for some but for many, it fails.  Everyone here is aware of the rise in low paid and precarious work and in zero-hour or low-hour contracts.  We also know that this is a deliberate practice and is part of the race to the bottom.  We have seen the ongoing practice of replacing reasonably paid workers on decent contracts with lower paid workers on inferior contracts.  This is done by denying the right to trade union representation within the workplace.  Why do employers do this?  They do it because they can.  We have seen it happening in the financial services, hospitality, retail and many other sectors.  We have also seen some employers engaging in campaigns of bullying and harassment.  Those who seek to bully and who ignore industrial relations laws and mechanisms do so to protect their interests while exploiting their employees.  They are denying workers their right to choose who should represent them.  There is not a level playing field between workers and employers but this Bill seeks to correct that.<\/p>  <p>  Those who value their employees have absolutely nothing to fear from strengthened labour laws.  Last month Ryanair finally accepted the principles that are outlined in this Bill when it agreed to engage with unions for the first time ever.  Now is the time for this Bill so that ordinary workers will have the right to choose who should represent them in their workplace, both for collective bargaining and disciplinary matters and to have that right recognised by their employers.  This Republic is only a republic in name if we do not protect the rights of our citizens and central to that protection are the rights of workers in the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00100","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119300,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119300,"counter":186,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516119300,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119300,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00600","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516119300,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1516119300,"counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1516119300,"counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q00950"},{"type":"question","time":1516119300,"counter":193,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[52001\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet Committee B, social policy and public services, last met; and when it will meet again.

Is the committee looking at the issue of the pension anomaly that currently exists that disproportionately adversely affects women?  When will we see proposals emerging on this?  There are two elements to this issue.  The most obvious one is the impact of averaging on women who spent periods outside of the workplace, particularly for child rearing and specifically the impact of calculating the average from the first day worked.  The second issue is the impact of raising the pension age for people who have contracted to finish work at 65 and how the gap between the formal ending of work and qualification for a State pension will be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise one other issue with the Taoiseach.  Last September a campaign called Make Way Day was run by the Disability Federation of Ireland.  It was a very simple campaign involving people with disabilities, particularly people in wheelchairs and those who are visually impaired, making their way around our thoroughfares, footpaths and streets and putting stickers on obstacles including things like sandwich boards, improperly placed seating and signage, in order to make us all aware of how such things negatively impact on the freedom of people with disabilities to move about our towns and streets.  Would the Government consider examining this campaign with a view to formally promoting it?  The Cabinet social policy committee might be the vehicle through which Government could determine how it could become a national campaign that would have meaning, possibly leading to legislation to improve accessibility and mobility for people with disabilities in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600018#Q01400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I am just trying to figure out how this committee could work and am looking at some of the contradictions that arise.  One of the contradictions arising relates to the significant increase in cyberbullying directed at children as well as in online predators.  The Taoiseach knows that digital technology plays an increasingly major role in the lives of young people and is a tremendous educational resource.  There seems to be a contradiction between the position set against the Taoiseach's name with regard to bringing forward a digital safety commissioner and the position articulated by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.  Just before Christmas the Taoiseach called on international technology firms to do more to protect children from these threats but indicated that he was cancelling plans to create a digital safety commissioner who would have the power to impose substantial fines on social media firms that permit harmful or illegal material to be published on their platforms.  It seems from what he said that the Taoiseach thinks the onus should be on the technology companies themselves to police their services.  However, the Law Reform Commission has recommended an online safety watchdog and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, supports the introduction of a digital safety commissioner, as does the relevant Minister.  There seems to be a lack of co-ordination in the Government's position on this issue.  While I do not want my remarks to be misinterpreted, these technology companies are lobbying against EU proposals to strengthen online privacy rules which would effect the money they make from online advertising.  Is this the type of issue that deserves the attention of the Cabinet committee?  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the creation of a digital safety commissioner and Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire brought forward a very good Bill on same.  We believe that an office of a commissioner for digital safety could promote safety online, review and regulate harmful digital communications and so on.

I suggest that the report produced yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, which claims successes in exceeding targets in the delivery of social housing is misleading propaganda.  When we look more closely at the claim in the report that the housing needs of 25,000 people have been met, we see that 75% of the successes in meeting people's housing needs involved housing assistance payments, the rental accommodation scheme or leasing from the private sector.  I will give an example.  Gemma, who is a mother of two children, is included in the Government's success figures because she got a housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy last February.  After her landlord pulled out of the agreement in April, Gemma and her two children, aged four and two, had to go into emergency accommodation.  They are now living with Gemma's grandmother, her three uncles and her aunt, which means that eight people across four generations are sharing a two-bedroom house.  Last year's statistics consider her to have had her housing needs met.  The reliance on the HAP scheme, which is not meeting people's housing needs because it is precarious rather than permanent, means that the figures are not credible.  There is evidence in last year's figures that many of the people in respect of whom we are claiming success are back in emergency or chronic overcrowding conditions.

During the 2016 general election campaign, we had a debate on whether to prioritise improving public services or introducing a United States-style tax system.  The social policy and public services committee is a key conduit of Government policy in this regard.  The bottom line is that public services in sectors like health and housing are getting worse.  There are 500,000 patients on waiting lists.  Over 8,000 people are in emergency accommodation.  There are 95,000 people on the social housing list.  The Taoiseach has a habit of trying to use figures to suit himself, but the bottom line with regard to health is that approximately 2,000 extra beds were provided between 2000 and 2010.  I accept that approximately 800 beds were taken out when the recession hit in 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600019#R00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516119900,"counter":202,"content":"<p>It started going down in 2007.

We can go into who was in charge in each of those years, but that is not the point.  I do not know whether the Cabinet committee on social policy has any bearing on the preparations for the budget.  In the run-up to the budget, surely we need far more transparency about what it will take to deal with something like an accident and emergency crisis.  When I asked the Taoiseach about Letterkenny University Hospital, I did not get any answer from him other than the general kind of stuff that drives people mad.  He spoke about an allocation of &euro;30 million.  The fate of the specific bed capacity proposal that was made by Letterkenny University Hospital is a concrete example and illustration of the inertia in the system.  The hospital authorities asked last summer for &euro;1.8 million to open 20 beds.  If that money had been provided, it would have enabled the hospital to do substantial work during this winter's crisis.  It is alarming that this money was not provided and, as a result, we drifted into the crisis and people experienced significant distress.<\/p>  <p>  I could not agree more with what Deputy Boyd Barrett has said about housing, which was raised repeatedly during the first clinics of January.

To the best of my recollection, the Government has not made a decision on whether to legislate to establish a digital safety commissioner.  As I may well be incorrect in that regard, I will double-check it.  I do not recall a Government decision being made.  Obviously, any proposal would have to come to the Cabinet.  It could come to this Cabinet committee first.  I am certainly not opposed to the proposal.  I just do not recall having seen a proposal, or its having been approved by the Government to date.  Having said that, I am very conscious of the issue of digital safety.  When we are talking about the Internet, we are talking about a worldwide web.  We need to be realistic about what can be achieved by an Irish commission or Irish laws, which of course would have no extra-territorial effect whatsoever.  That is why I have been putting pressure on the companies themselves, which operate on an international basis outside this country, to be more responsible and to mediate and edit the content that is on their websites.<\/p><p> On housing numbers, HAP, works for many people.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin cited an individual case and I have no doubt that what he said about it is true.  However, I have encountered individual cases in my constituency involving people in receipt of HAP or rent supplement who do not accept social housing when it is offered to them because they would prefer to stay where they are.  Even though they receive the HAP or rent supplement, they like the houses they are in, believe they are secure in them and do not want to move to different roads, parishes or school districts.  It is important to bear in mind that every individual's experience is different and that the housing assistance payment works for many people.  The evidence can be seen in the number of people in receipt of rent supplement or HAP who decline offers of social housing.<\/p> <p> In terms of solutions, as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has indicated, we will move more and more towards direct build and increasing the social housing stock in the years ahead.  While HAP will be a solution for many people, the focus in the capital programme is already shifting towards building more.  In 2016, only 657 houses were built and added to the social housing stock.  The figure rose to 2,245 last year, which was an almost threefold increase.  These figures include direct builds from local authorities, houses built by approved housing bodies, such as the Peter McVerry Trust and the Iveagh Trust, and houses acquired through Part V.  The increase from 657 to 2,245 is significant and our target for this year is to have 3,800 social houses built.  Building can only be ramped up at a realistic pace because there are only so many construction workers and firms in the country.  We ramped up the number of social houses built from 657 in 2016 to 2,245 in 2017, a significant increase.  We will continue to ramp up activity in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> Last year, there were also 2,266 acquisitions and 1,757 voids were brought back into use.  If one leaves out HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the social housing stock increased by approximately 7,000 last year.  While this was a significant increase, the figure needs to be closer to 10,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600019#R03200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Dialogue","time":1516120500,"counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600020#S00200"},{"type":"question","time":1516120500,"counter":233,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[52725\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600020#S00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans to ensure a whole-of-Government approach to policy development and problem-solving by his Ministers; and the way in which he plans to encourage co-operation between Ministers in respect of issues as they arise across Government.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1516120500,"counter":234,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[2115\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600020#S00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the position regarding policy formulation in his Department; and the way in which co-operation with other Ministers and Departments is co-ordinated.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516120500,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and  81 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government acts collectively and any work done by a Minister within a Department is done with a whole-of-Government approach.

I had the privilege of serving in three Cabinets.  One of the difficulties at Cabinet is that Ministers become preoccupied with the particular focus and affairs of their respective Departments.  We need to think outside the box if we are to solve the affordable housing problem.  Based on my experience in government and on foot of my dealings with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, at close quarters, I made a proposal almost two years ago that the latter be transformed into a housing delivery agency.  It has the skill set and landbank, as well as access to capital and direct relations with developers and builders.  While in government, we started, in a small way, to push a social and affordable housing agenda.  Are discussions taking place between the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments to ensure a new housing delivery agency is created from the NAMA framework?  Has this important proposal been considered and, if not, will it be considered?  I welcome the statement by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party last week, which made more or less the same proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke of the number of social houses built in 2017.  These houses were built under the allocation of &euro;2.2 billion we made in government in 2015.

The planned trip to North Korea comes to mind but there have been other examples of differences on policy and the approach to be taken to particular issues.  I was struck by the comment made by the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Halligan, that the Korean adventure was triggered by an off-the-cuff comment by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath.  It would be alarming if the frequent off-the-cuff remarks of the latter Minister of State were to become the basis for formulating Government policy in future.<\/p>  <p>  Be that as it may, the absence of joined-up Government is a critical weakness in the delivery and execution of policy.  This applies in areas such as disability and special educational needs where individual Ministers operate in silos.<\/p>  <p>  The strategic communications unit, SCU, illustrates the obsession with spin, announcements and pronouncements as opposed to substance, delivery and Government action.  For example, while a new campaign manager for Healthy Ireland and four or five other campaigns, including a new hospital campaign, has been appointed to the SCU, the latter will not have any involvement in explaining what is being done about the hundreds of extra patients on trolleys.  I do not believe the unit will ever speak about trolleys or children with special needs who have been fostered or are not receiving the supports they need from the Health Service Executive and Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be a focus on cross-departmental co-ordination and delivery of targets in the programme for Government.

One problem with the housing crisis - it is a feature of some of the crises in other public services as well - is that we cannot get the workers to do the work that is necessary to solve the crises.  We talk about capacity problems in housing.  We cannot get nurses and teachers in a range of areas.  Why is that?  Part of the answer was outside the D&aacute;il today.  A construction worker, who is also involved in the national housing and homelessness coalition organising the march, was protesting along with other construction workers because they work for agencies on zero-hour contracts.  They literally do not know from day to day or from week to week whether they will have a week's work or a day's work.  They maintain they do not want to work in construction anymore.

However, what we want is delivery, action and a joined-up approach.  There has been failure to deal with these major crises.

There is unnecessary stress in the lives of people, especially women, because of the crisis in our emergency services, the homelessness crisis, the issue of people being on trolleys, the issue of children who are homeless and the report from the Ombudsman for Children that lifts another lid on what is another stressful situation for the children involved as well as their carers.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have a joined-up approach.

Details of the scheme will be announced shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies are right to raise the whole issue of affordable housing.  When it comes to discourse in the House and public discourse the focus tends to be on homelessness and social housing because those issues are so important.  However, we should not forget that the vast majority of people in the country provide their own housing and most people want to buy and own their own houses.  We need to ensure that is possible for the vast majority of people.  That requires measures such as the affordable housing scheme and ensuring that it is affordable to build houses.  That is why new regulations are coming to reduce the cost of building apartment blocks.  This will allow us to build more of them in our cities and towns and give people the opportunity to buy apartments and to get on the housing ladder again.

Changing the remit of NAMA may force the agency to go on-balance-sheet or we could run into issues around state aid.  If NAMA was competing with the private construction sector in the private rental market and the private housing construction market, that could constitute state aid.

In many ways, it will do what Deputies are suggesting, that is to say, taking the expertise, knowledge and staff from NAMA as it is wound down.  It will be capitalised from the State using ISIF and will be able to do certain things.  However, Deputies should bear in mind my warning on what some people are suggesting about NAMA and how it could backfire badly on our State and community.<\/p>  <p>  Healthy Ireland is very much a cross-government initiative.

The Taoiseach said that the Constitution restricts us to having 15 Ministers but it does not restrict us to having 15 Departments of State.

I am sure, however, that he was surprised at the volume, and perhaps he was alarmed at revelations that some hearings of the tribunal had to be rescheduled because dozens of additional boxes were delivered from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge and accept that this reflects badly on the Department?  It took his intervention as Taoiseach to get co-operation with this tribunal.  Mr. Justice Charleton asked everyone to bring forward information to help him understand who did what, who said what, when and in what terms and who communicated with whom, by whatever means, and in what terms.  This is a vindication of those Deputies who persisted in challenging the narrative from the previous Minister for Justice and Equality that the tribunal was receiving full support.

It was very striking that Ms Justice Ring has been unable to bring a single protected disclosure investigation to a satisfactory conclusion because of chronic understaffing.  This issue has affected and contaminated this Government as it did the last one.  GSOC is saying it cannot bring a single protected disclosure investigation to a satisfactory conclusion because it does not have the staff.  Ms Justice Ring has also called for GSOC to be independent of the Department of Justice and Equality, to be answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  She said GSOC has failed people who came to it to make protected disclosures and has warned that without resources, it would not be able to meet its central objective of ensuring that all investigations are conducted effectively, efficiently and fairly.<\/p>  <p>  We spoke earlier about a whole-of-government approach.  Is this issue of lack of accountability, of scandal, of allegations and so on, not by ordinary citizens but affecting them, and of allegations discrediting those who come forward, not at the root of the discomfiture, cynicism and disillusionment with public affairs and politics?  The sum is relatively small, &euro;900,000.  It costs much more to set up tribunals and investigations.

Deputy Brendan Howlin rightly says it is possible to have two Secretaries General and two Departments under the one Cabinet Minister.  That is what we have under the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the head of the Civil Service, Mr. Martin Fraser, to examine this as a possibility.  We have to advertise for a new Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  If we are to go the whole hog and split it into two Departments, this would be the appropriate time to advertise for two Secretaries General, rather than one.  That is being scoped out as an option.  We must bear in mind, however, that it would be a deviation from the Toland report which recommended having a single Secretary General of a single Department, with two deputy Secretaries General heading up different divisions.<\/p> <p> The Cabinet has not yet agreed a salary scale for the new Garda Commissioner.  That issue has not yet been considered by the Cabinet.  On the Kenneally case, the Government is very keen to allow the commission of investigation to begin its work as soon as possible.  We have no interest in delaying the commission's work.  At the same time, we do not want to jeopardise potential future prosecutions.  The Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality are working on the issue and the Minister will meet the families as soon as he has some news.  We are working towards a solution that will allow the commission to begin its work.  It might not be able to do all of its work, but it would at least be able to commence it.  The Minister for Justice and Equality certainly speaks for me and all of Government on these matters.<\/p> <p> On the additional documents provided by the Department of Justice and Equality for the tribunal, I am not sure what their volume is.  I have heard reports that the volume is great, but I do not know that for a fact.  I directed the Department of Justice and Equality to provide all documents for the tribunal and in doing so asked it to err on the side of generosity.  If the officials were unsure about whether a document fell within the terms of reference, I asked that they send it anyway.  It may be the case that many of the additional documents handed over do not fall within the remit of the tribunal.  We will see that matter play out in the coming weeks and months as the tribunal does its work.<\/p> <p> The budget of GSOC for this year has been increased to just over &euro;10 million, up from &euro;9.6 million last year, or an increase of over &euro;400,000.  The number of staff was 77 in 2015 and 2016.  This figure increased to 84 in 2017 and will rise to 94 in 2018.  That is not rhetoric; they are the facts.  Consideration is also being given to additional staffing for the new protected disclosures unit once it is up and running.  GSOC is already being given a bigger budget and more staff and may need a bigger budget and more staff into the future.  However, the Government has to be prudent.  We always have to bear in mind that we are dealing with taxpayers' money.  Every public body states it is understaffed.  I have yet to come across a public body since the foundation of the State that has stated it has enough or too many staff.  Public bodies always seek additional staff.  We have a job as a Government and custodians of taxpayers' money to validate requests or bids for additional staff; to prioritise, given the fact that even with an expanding budget, budgets are limited; and also to understand what the outcomes would actually be for taxpayers and society.<\/p> <p> On changing the role of the Policing Authority and the independence of GSOC, these matters are being considered by the commission on the future of policing which will report this year.  Rather than make changes now to the role and remit of the Policing Authority or to whom GSOC reports, it would be appropriate to allow the O'Toole commission to make its recommendations.  When we have them, we can make decisions on policy changes.<\/p> <p> I do not know if there is a protocol on the use of personal email accounts.  If there is not, there probably should be.  I will check to see what the position is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600022#U00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122300,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Of course, there should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600023#V00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Council: Statements","time":1516122300,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600023#V00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122300,"counter":263,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm Iabhairt os comhair na D&aacute;la inniu faoi chruinni&uacute; Chomhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh a bh&iacute; ar si&uacute;l sa Bhruis&eacute;al an 14 Nollaig agus an 15 Nollaig.

I look forward to meeting President Tajani again tomorrow in Strasbourg where I will be the first EU Head of Government to address the European Parliament as part of its debate series on the future of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council then moved on to review security and defence.  As on previous occasions, the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, attended the meeting and in his remarks underlined the importance of complementarity between his organisation and the European Union and the need for strong European defence.  A Europe worth building is a Europe worth defending and Europe should not rely on the United States and the United Kingdom to do it for it.  Within the European Union work has moved forward with the launch of the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, arrangement.  I am happy that Ireland is among the 25 member states to participate from the beginning.  We are a founder member of PESCO, just as we were of the euro and the Single Market.  PESCO provides a mechanism through which crisis management capabilities can be developed by member states in support of common security and defence operations.  As I have said previously, participation in PESCO in no way changes our policy of military neutrality.  We will continue to make our distinctive contribution based on our own traditions and strengths.  However, we should also recognise that there are new challenges that confront all countries, including Ireland, such as terrorism, uncontrolled mass migration, cyber-crime and drug and human trafficking and that it makes sense to work together to respond to them.  No nation state can do so on its own.  I look forward to Ireland participating in projects that are suited to our particular capabilities and position.  I restate my view that our military neutrality and non-membership of NATO are a foreign policy strength and enhance our position as an honest broker and as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon and other parts of the world.<\/p>  <p>  The next item for discussion was social, educational and cultural co-operation, following on from the successful social summit in Gothenberg in November.  While member states remain primarily responsible for these areas, much can be achieved by working together.  A number of interesting points were raised such as including the social agenda as part of the European Semester, although a decision on which was not taken at the European Council.  The concept of European universities was also raised and we are very enthusiastic about exploring it further.  The Commission will report back in the coming months on how some of these ideas might be brought forward.  I see real opportunities in this for one or more Irish universities in becoming part of a European university.  We also had a short discussion on climate change and the One Planet summit held in Paris last month.<\/p>  <p>  In our evening session we had an extensive discussion on migration.  While there were no formal conclusions, there was a clear recognition that much had been accomplished on the external dimension, with a sense around the table that the European Union needed to take further action externally to tackle the root causes of mass migration.  On the internal dimension, different positions were aired and it was agreed that we would return to the discussion later in the year.  Europe needs an effective and sustainable policy which will respect the responsibility and solidarity of member states.  We also discussed a range of external relations items, including Russia and Ukraine and Jerusalem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will provide more detail on some of these issues and the social dimension in her remarks.<\/p>  <p>  On Mercosur, we heard a presentation by the Iberian countries on the advantages of a trade deal for Europe.  As the House is aware, while Ireland recognises the potential for a deal to be of great benefit to Irish industry and the economy, we have some concerns about the beef industry, in particular.  France shares this position and both President Macron and I intervened to give our strong views on what should and should not be included in such a deal.<\/p><p>The Friday morning euro summit which met in its extended format took place in the presence of outgoing President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem and the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, whom I welcomed to Dublin late last year.  Both noted that the economic situation across Europe was much improved, how the single currency was in better shape and, in contrast to previous years, that there was greater convergence among eurozone economies.  However, both called for this period of relative calm to be used to make European Monetary Union more resilient.  I supported this call in my remarks, pointing out that the European Council did not predict the last financial crisis and that there could be no room for complacency about the future.  We agreed that the banking union should be completed, although the timing and sequencing, particularly of risk reduction, was still being worked out.  I expressed strong support for completing the capital markets union.<br\/><br\/>There was some discussion about institutional change, including the possibility of establishing a European monetary fund to replace the troika and a possible Finance Minister for the eurozone.  Ireland has an open mind on these proposals and would welcome more detail before making a decision.  It was also agreed that Finance Ministers should advance their work on these issues, with the European Council retaining oversight.  President Tusk has announced that he will convene another eurozone summit in March, at which we will consider these matters further. <br\/><br\/> The European Council met in Article 50 format, without Prime Minister May, and formally took the decision that sufficient progress had been made in phase 1 of the Brexit negotiations to allow us to move on to phase 2.  As the House is aware, Ireland was able to rely on the strong support and solidarity of our partners in ensuring what was agreed represented an acceptable outcome on issues related to Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I expressed our thanks to my colleagues around the table and they, in turn, assured me that we could continue to rely on their support as the negotiations continued.  <br\/><br\/>As we move into phase 2, when transitional arrangements and the framework for the United Kingdom&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union will be considered, it will be important to remain vigilant to ensure the commitments entered into in December are delivered in full.  There can be no back-sliding.  I am pleased that we agreed to negotiate a transition period and prioritise discussion of it in the first part of phase 2.  Such an arrangement is essential if we are to provide certainty for businesses and citizens and enable them to plan for permanent changes that may occur as a result of Brexit.<br\/><br\/>In addition, internal preparatory discussions among the EU 27 on further guidelines at the European Council in March on the framework for the future relationship will begin.  In parallel, the European Council called on the EU and UK negotiators to complete their work on withdrawal issues and start drafting the relevant parts of the legally binding withdrawal agreement.  Later this month the General Affairs Council which will be attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will adopt additional negotiating directives on transitional arrangements and discussions with the United Kingdom on agreeing these transitional arrangements will then begin.  This could be a <i>status quo<\/i>agreement, with the aim of avoiding gaps or cliff edge effects between the United Kingdom leaving the European Union and the entry into force of the future relationship agreement.<br\/><br\/>In parallel to the negotiations and related work in Brussels, the Government&rsquo;s detailed planning to prepare for the United Kingdom&rsquo;s exit, including contingency planning for all possible scenarios, will continue at home.  We have already taken some important steps to prepare the domestic economy, including the Action Plan for Jobs and the trade and investment strategy.  Several dedicated measures were announced in budget 2018, including a loan scheme for business and additional supports for capital investment in the food industry.  The House can be assured that, as we have done up to now in the negotiations, the Government will continue to advance and defend Ireland&rsquo;s interests and seek to mitigate the negative effects of Brexit for the country and exploit opportunities.  I look forward to hearing Deputies&rsquo; views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600023#V00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122900,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Is l&eacute;ir nach raibh cruinni&uacute; na Comhairle Eorpa&iacute; i m&iacute; Dheireadh F&oacute;mhair chomh pr&aacute;inneach agus a cheapamar roimhe sin, c&eacute; go raibh ceist Brexit beagnach r&eacute;itithe roimh an gcruinni&uacute;.

In the end, it was low key and simply confirmed decisions which had already been announced.  In advance of the summit we discussed the outcome of the first round of Brexit negotiations.  Now that some of the smoke and hubris which surrounded the agreement have passed, there is much greater clarity on where we find ourselves.  A transition deal followed by a comprehensive free trade agreement is the only negotiated outcome which is compatible with the core positions of both sides. <\/p>  <p>  For the European Union, the bottom line is that the United Kingdom will not be given preferential treatment which will undermine the basic legal foundations of the Union.  For the United Kingdom, it is about not being subject to the European Union's judicial mechanisms and being able to conduct an independent free trade policy.  It is ridiculous that it took the United Kingdom 18 months to recognise the reality that it no longer had the ability to intimidate the European Union by threatening a barrage of tabloid headlines and a possible veto.   <\/p>  <p>  Michel Barnier and his team have done an excellent job so far in their overall approach to the negotiations and we should have confidence in them to conclude a common-sense deal in the next ten months.  The situation as it affects Ireland is far less clear.  As we have said before, Fianna F&aacute;il strongly welcomes the reassertion of the continued EU citizenship of Northern Ireland residents post-Brexit.  This is a matter which we raised first and which was, for us, an absolute red line.  However, we are very concerned about the basic contradiction within the agreement about the introduction of new economic divisions on the island.  The final text repeats the assertions of the UK Government from very early in the process about its intentions to avoid new barriers.  This is contradicted by its new statement that all parts of the United Kingdom will be treated exactly the same.  All of the commentary we have heard from the government in London and much of what appears to be the focus of the Irish Government concerns the absence of physical barriers on the Border.  The Taoiseach, reflecting what is, unfortunately, his very partisan way of presenting history, has emphasised the issue of physical barriers.  The fact is that what is being discussed is a differently managed border, not the absence of a border, and it appears that the Government has gone all-in on a strategy of emphasising the overall UK-EU agreement rather than a special arrangement for this island.  This is exactly the opposite of the self-aggrandising claim to be the first leader in 95 years to care about the North.  As we have said many times before, some special economic zone is likely to be the only means of mitigating the full impact of Brexit on this island.<\/p>  <p>  The final negotiations revealed a breakdown in relations between the Government and the May Administration, with a display of negotiation through the media not seen for over 30 years.  Building close relationships and setting out detailed proposals are much more difficult than focusing on the public dimension, but if anything concrete is to be achieved this year, we need greater urgency and a greater focus than we have seen to date.  As President Tusk said in December, what was agreed was the easy part of the process.  It is time to put in place an approach which will be capable of delivering a substantive result for Ireland in the negotiations this year.<\/p>  <p>  The bulk of the summit was concerned with other matters.  We strongly support the Council's opposition to the unjustified and damaging decision of the Trump Administration to take steps to move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognise Jerusalem as the capital.  I note that the Taoiseach did not refer to what he had stated at the meeting, but I presume the Minister of State will elaborate on that issue.  There is no positive dimension to this decision for anyone who supports a fair peace based on a two-state solution.  The continued drift of the Netanyahu Government towards a position of undermining any potential Palestinian state has been escalated by this decision.  Ireland should continue to stand with its European partners in supporting a fair peace and opposing moves which entrench and promote long-term conflict.<\/p>  <p>  The summit also formally addressed the PESCO defence agreement.  As has been shown time and again, EU defence co-operation has respected the positions of members that are not in NATO.  PESCO is about developing capacities.  In our case, it will help us to continue to develop defence forces which have unique skills in peacekeeping and civil protection.  Therefore, we welcome it.  However, let no one be in any doubt that the principal issue in hand for us is whether we treat members of the Defence Forces decently with fair pay and fair conditions.  In the seven years since the Department of Defence had its own separate full member of the Cabinet there have been drift and neglect.  Dealing with this issue should be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Commission&rsquo;s action on Poland and the rule of law, there is a vital principle at stake.<\/p><p>The European Union is not just an economic entity, it is also fundamentally based on the values of liberal democracy which include fair elections, a balance of powers and respect for rights.  The attempt by the Polish Government to take direct charge of the judiciary is clearly against these core values.  That said, the various illiberal decisions of the Orb&aacute;n Government in Hungary, including taking political control of every independent state institution, seem to have gone even further and been subject to no intervention.  Before this matter proceeds, it would be a good idea to have a wider discussion on where it is going and the specific objectives involved.  I do not think we have had sufficient debate on these issues in this House in terms of the drift in the direction Hungary and Poland are taking or as fully fledged members of the European Union in enshrining the values the European Union espouses.  To a certain extent, there has been silence and a brushing under the carpet in the domestic debate here and at European level.  That said, I welcome the more recent initiatives on that front at European level.<br\/><br\/>The euro summit which accompanied the full summit had no substantive outcome.  The upturn in the euro economy is very positive, but the last thing it should lead to is complacency or a sense that the need for reform has been removed.  The banking union is far from complete and the full separation of banking debt and sovereign debt has not been achieved.  A unified system of control and a unified currency require a broad-based system for risk sharing and bank resolution.  Continued German objections to it are holding back an essential reform.  We are unconvinced by the Commission's proposal to subsume the mechanism for aiding states with borrowing problems under its oversight.<br\/><br\/>We repeat our call on the Taoiseach to state exactly what Ireland is proposing on the digital taxation initiative.  During Taoiseach's questions I repeatedly asked him to clarify his strategy for the March summit which is due to decide the issue. yet he has repeatedly refused to say anything.  The more he does that the more it will look like he is simply waiting to see what will happen.  <br\/><br\/>While leaders noted actions concerning migration, there was no substantive discussion of the continued humanitarian catastrophe in Syria.  According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, there are 5.4 million registered refugees from Syria.  Of these, 1 million have sought asylum in the European Union.  Ireland has, rightly, agreed to participate in the resettlement of refugees, but we should also acknowledge the generosity of Germany and Sweden which have, between them, taken fully 64% of all refugees.  The political bravery of their leaders, particularly Chancellor Merkel, in standing for humanitarian values in the face of intolerance is something we should acknowledge and honour.  However, more needs to be done.  First, there should be a significant increase in support for basic facilities for refugees in Turkey, Lebanon and other countries in the region.  The UNHCR states there is a &euro;2 billion gap in the budget for 2018.  Ireland and the European Union should take immediate steps to help to close the gap.  Second, we should continue to speak up for the victims of war crimes committed during the Syrian conflict.  That Russia has repeatedly vetoed the efforts of the United Nations to investigate likely gas attacks by the Syrian regime against its own people is a shocking reflection of how far it is willing to go in supporting a dictatorship and playing geopolitics.<br\/><br\/>This year will be dominated by the Brexit negotiations.  In the journey from generalities to a hard agreement an enormous amount of work must be undertaken.  For Ireland, the challenge is to build the missing constructive relationships and be willing to start proposing specific solutions to at least limit the inevitable damage caused by Brexit.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly is in London with Deputies Niall Collins and Darragh O'Brien.  It is interesting that the perspective on Brexit they are getting from British interlocutors is far different from the message and sense of what the agreement means here.  I met the Scottish Minister responsible for Brexit, Mr. Mike Russell, in Killarney at the weekend, with Mr. Mark Drakeford from Wales, and they were very surprised by my explanation of our understanding of what the phase 1 agreement constituted <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>what they were hearing from the Westminster Government on the same issue.  That indicates clearly the need to be vigilant in the months and years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600024#W00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516123500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Beidh m&eacute; ag roinnt ama leis an Teachta David Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600025#X00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1516123500,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Aontaithe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600025#X00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516123500,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar ais roimh an Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

Ahead of the crucial meeting of the European Council last month, Sinn F&eacute;in made it clear that it was vital that the Government secure additional guarantees from the British Prime Minister about the legal standing of the joint report issued by the European Commission and the British Government in December.  We said that additional guarantees were needed because at the very heart of the report was a set of fundamental contradictions.  Contradiction No. 1 is that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland but that the North will be dragged out of the customs union and the Single Market.  Contradiction No. 2 is that there is no threat to the Good Friday Agreement, yet there 142 areas of all-Ireland co-operation that could be adversely affected by the Tory Brexit.  Contradiction No. 3 is that there will be no erosion of rights for citizens living in the North but Britain is to push ahead with its withdrawal from the European Court of Justice.  Contradiction No. 4 is that the people of the North voted to remain in the European Union, but that decision that has been ignored by the British Government, the DUP and others.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in flagged the contradictions with the Government and advised that it needed to be very careful in its dealings with the British Government.  I note the Taoiseach's warning today that we need to remain vigilant to deliver on the commitments made in December, to ensure they will be delivered on in full and that there will be no backsliding.  I have learned from decades of experience that British Governments are adept at ensuring the text of agreements is written in such a way that they allow for various interpretations on another date.  The interpretation they adopt is always the one which advances British interests over all others.  They argue that that is their job.  In fact, a senior civil servant once said it was their job to allow for whatever interpretation was required.<\/p>  <p>  The job of the Taoiseach and the Government is to protect, defend and advance the national interest.  For too long the Government has seen itself purely as acting in the interests of the State.  It is welcome that the Taoiseach is looking out for the interests of the people, North and South.  It is a source of some bemusement for me that at this time the Fine Gael leader is more sound on issues to do with the national question than the Fianna F&aacute;il leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600025#X00600","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1516123500,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600025#X00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516123500,"counter":273,"content":"<p>We want the Taoiseach to move beyond the rhetoric.

That is what has happened, but the question is whether we have rock solid, iron clad guarantees.  I can only assume that the Taoiseach sought them.  We could ask him whether he secured legal assurances from his British counterparts and European colleagues.  I assume that they delivered the necessary clarity, certainty and confidence that are so lacking in the joint report.  Will the Taoiseach tell the D&aacute;il what additional legal assurances he sought and secured, as opposed to it being a matter of the Irish interpretation or the European Union and British interpretation?  Will he give a commitment to publish assurances he may have received in order that Members of the Oireachtas can take the time to examine them?<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to take a moment to address remarks made by the DUP leader, Ms Arlene Foster, in Killarney at the weekend.  I acknowledge and welcome her statement that she is opposed to a hard border.  The problem is that while Ms Foster and the DUP state they are opposed to a hard border, they are also demanding that the North leave both the customs unions and the Single Market.  If that happens, it will guarantee the imposition of a hard border.  We have been championing a practical solution, namely, for the North to have special designated status within the European Union.  That is the only and best solution.  It would also respect the vote of the people in the North and is endorsed by the majority of MLAs.  It is endorsed, in particular, by the people of the North and also by the D&aacute;il.

All three are crucial and central to the future of the people of this island.  All of these Council meetings are at a time when there is a focus on the future of Europe and discussion on the type of Europe we want to build.  We all now recognise that this future will be without Britain and that Britain is intent on leaving the European Union.  It is the job of the Irish Government to ensure we protect our interests and those of Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit, we welcomed, as the Taoiseach knows, the relative progress made in recent times in the joint agreement and joint report agreed by all member states regarding the Irish issues and others also.  We are now entering a second round of talks at which the heavy lifting will be done, at which the flesh will be put on the bones of all these issues and where the real negotiations will begin.  The caveat and background to all that is that the other member states will be really focused on the big issue of whether there will be a trade agreement between Britain and the European Union.  Obviously, we want such an agreement and, if possible, Britain to stay within the customs union and the Single Market.  The difficulty we have is that there are real contradictions.  By \"we\", I mean everybody on the island of Ireland, particularly those who want to avoid a hard border and those who want to ensure we protect the rights of citizens, be they Irish citizens or citizens from other member states living in the North or South, and protect the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  What we are hearing from the Tory party depends on what wing one is listening to.  It is very difficult when one is negotiating with three wings, or possibly four, of another political party, but that is what the member states are trying to do.  If one listens to the British Government and British Prime Minister, however, one notes they are saying that Britain and the North will come out of the customs union, Single Market and legal framework of the European Union.  That means the Good Friday Agreement also.  Thus, we do not have assurances that citizens in the North will enjoy exactly the same rights as European citizens in the South when the North is taken out of the European Union.  These are contradictions that cannot be squared unless we have absolutely firm commitments that the North will stay in the customs union and the Single Market and remain subject to the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  We have consistently said all of this is possible.  We, and even members of the Taoiseach's Government and the former Taoiseach, heard that any kind of special solution for Ireland was not possible.  It is possible.  It is possible for the North to remain within the European Union.  It is possible to have special status.  It is possible for the North to stay in the customs union and Single Market if the political will exists.  If the political will exists, anything is possible.  All of this is unprecedented in terms of Britain leaving the European Union anyway.  Let me state my words of caution to the Taoiseach.  I doubt that he needs them.  He has been described as being a bit greener than previous Fianna F&aacute;il leaders in the past, which some might regard as quite ironic.  Even leaving that aside, I do not need to remind the Taoiseach that when the heavy lifting will be done over the coming months and when we begin to negotiate the actual detail, the British Government will act in British interests, as Teachta Adams said.  That is what it would be expected to do.  The Taoiseach must act in the interest of Irish citizens in the North and South.  He has to make sure he gets the best possible deal for us and make sure full alignment means full alignment.  The only way he can achieve full alignment is by having the North stay in the customs union and Single Market.  If he comes back with something less, if there is a hardening of the Border, if the Good Friday Agreement is not protected and if EU citizens who live in the North do not have the same rights that they have now, it will be a problem and a matter for which his Government will have to account.  As long as the Taoiseach is acting in the national interest for all people who live on the island of Ireland, he will enjoy the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am sure he will enjoy the support of many people across the island.<\/p>  <p>  We are very focused on the time ahead.  We want to get the best possible deal and result but that will require considerable diligent, hard work and attention over the coming weeks and months.  My party will not be found wanting in making sure we do whatever we can to achieve the best possible outcome for everybody.  As I stated, that means the North staying in the European Union, the customs union, the Single Market, the political framework and legal framework, in addition to remaining subject to the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600026#Y00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516124100,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Brendan Howlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600026#Y00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516124100,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

Significant progress was made on Brexit and on the leaders' agenda, discussed prior to Christmas.  It is unfortunate that debate on many of the changes under way in Europe has been limited and more often lost in the understandable focus on Brexit.  Europe is changing, however.  The rush to advance the defence agenda just prior to Christmas is just one example.<\/p>  <p>  For six months, I called in this House for a debate on PESCO.  I listened to the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il give his view on it.  It was perfectly reasonable but we should have the debate and a full, open discussion on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Permanent structured co-operation on defence and security matters has been central to the changes under way in Europe.  It is a shame, therefore, that these matters were rushed through in two hours.  We were not to have any debate at all in this House on the matter until I insisted on it.  It was a joke of a reference to the defence committee of the House when the debate on its report was scheduled for the next day.  Thus, there was no opportunity to hear any expert witnesses on important matters.  That is not the way we bring people with us in an important debate on the future of Europe.  We have made such mistakes in the past.  Any changes will be subject to referendum in the future.  Therefore, let us bring our people on a journey of understanding as we discuss fundamental issues pertaining to the future of Europe, including this country.<\/p>  <p>  As I said in December, Ireland should have taken the same position as Malta, which adopted a wait-and-see approach because it believed certain operations may be in breach of the neutrality clause in its constitution.  The Irish Government has still not informed us which of the 17 joint projects under PESCO it intends to sign up to.  There should be no fear about an open and reasonable debate on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  On foreign policy in the Middle East, I welcome the firm commitment by leaders reiterating support for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine and the fact that the EU position on Jerusalem remains unchanged.  It is three years since the D&aacute;il unanimously voted to recognise the state of Palestine.  The Irish Government should now move to declare its recognition of Palestine as a state, and more efforts are needed to stop and reverse the development by Israel of illegal settlements.  This is an important item for the agenda of the European Union.  It seems we are moving away from peace as opposed to towards it, as we had hoped.  So many of the problems of the world have their genesis in the conflict in the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  The Council welcomed the progress on climate change and the outcome of the One Planet Summit in Paris.  That work now needs to be progressed further.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the next EU budget, there is an interesting proposal from the Commission that proceeds and profits of the EU emissions trading system should move from state level to EU level.  This is one of the proposals put forward to fill the EU budget gap that will be created when the UK leaves the Union.  The Government's view on this proposal and the other financial proposals should be set out clearly for us and we should have an opportunity to debate that also.<\/p>  <p>  More than likely Ireland will be asked to make a larger contribution to the EU budget.  There should be an open public debate on that.  Again, we need to address that matter and explain, if there are to be increased contributions, what they are for and how they are to be constructed.<\/p>  <p>  The second agenda item for the Council was the social dimension, education and culture.  Last month, I flagged a number of ideas proposed by the Party of European Socialists.  I hoped then that the Government would consider those.  A key agenda item at the Council was extending the ERASMUS programme on its 30th anniversary.  It is timely, as we recall with sadness the death of Peter Sutherland, to remember the work he did to create that groundbreaking programme when he was a European Commissioner.  It is one of the really important instruments that brought European citizens together.<\/p><p>The proposal from the leaders' agenda to envisage an ERASMUS programme for young artists would be a fitting legacy to and expansion of his work, as well as a tangible benefit for all EU citizens.  The outcomes of the Council also refer to a proposal to encourage the emergence by 2024 of some 20 European universities.  Will the Government outline what this will mean and if an Irish university will be encouraged to pursue this goal?<\/p> <p> The last Council was dominated by Brexit.  I was sceptical as to whether progress could be made.  It went to the wire but, thankfully, agreement was reached.  We would be under an illusion if we were to think that significant challenges do not remain.  It is a challenge for all of us when we are asked how the apparent opposite objectives of the UK Government's commitment to have no border on the island of Ireland while leaving the customs union at the same time can be achieved.  We need to get down to concrete detail ourselves, as well as those in the discussions taking place between Michel Barnier and UK Government, to ensure we have a deeper step-by-step understanding as how this will be envisaged and achieved.<\/p> <p> The December Council meeting agreed to begin work on the type of transition agreement that will be put in place for approximately two years.  It also will open discussions on the type of framework for the future relationship of the EU and the UK.  In advance of the March Council meeting, the detail of both the transition and the future relationship will have to be worked out.  Some details are beginning to emerge.  I believe that only the UK staying in the Single Market and customs union can deliver the type of border and future trade arrangements that Ireland needs.  Having listened to some Members earlier, I do not want a customs union barrier between Rosslare and Holyhead or Fishguard or Dublin and Liverpool.  While the issues discussed in some detail about the Border are important, the bulk of our trade is east-west and it is critical for all of us.<\/p> <p> The recent move by the UK Labour Party to acknowledge the need to stay in the customs union, as well as some form of linkage to the Single Market, is welcome.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  However, the news that Norway would seek radical changes to the European Economic Area, EEA, agreement in the event of special UK access to parts of the Single Market is a further reflection of the constraints on the UK's manoeuvrability in this regard.<\/p> <p> Moves are under way to identify funding for the next EU budget.  Where will the EU go when the UK exits?  The debate started by the French President has been added to in Germany by the Social Democratic Party of Germany, in the context of coalition discussions.  The future of Europe is a core concern for the Labour Party and for all social democrats, as well as democrats, on the Continent.  Across Europe, parties of the left fought long and hard to advance this political project and the benefits it would bring to all Europeans.  Laws, like the working time directive, parental leave and women's rights, have been an enormous advance for EU citizens.  As I said in December, we need the debate on how we can bring Europe closer to all our citizens, and that it is not merely some economic or trading entity but has an impact on the quality of lives of everybody else.<\/p> <p> We need to have a view on how Europe will be structured in the future.  Due to our understandable focus on Brexit, the future of Europe debate has been somewhat put to one side.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has been pivotal in this discussion but I share the concerns expressed in the House about the drift away from liberal democracy and adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, which were the drivers of the European project in the aftermath of the Second World War.  We need to understand what kind of European Union we want in the future.  Ireland should be a leader in that.  Although we have interests, we have also got values.  Those values should be clearly articulated in all discussions about the next steps to be taken about Europe's future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600026#Y00600","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516124700,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600027#Z00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1516124700,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The European Union is not like the US or Donald Trump in enthusiastically endorsing and cheering on Israeli oppression with, for example, the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem.  The EU can try to bask in an inverted reflected glory of not being Donald Trump and look as if it is somehow friends of the Palestinian people.  However, the reality is different.

She is a Palestinian activist and a recognised human rights defender who was arrested in the early hours of 19 December.  She was taken from her home by Israeli soldiers, put into a military jeep and has been held in a military prison, Ofer Prison, since.  Her mother was detained on the same day when she went to a detention centre to ask of her daughter's whereabouts.<\/p>  <p>  One day, prior to her arrest, Ahed Tamimi was protesting against occupation soldiers who shot her 15-year-old cousin in the face, putting him in a critical condition.  During the raid, soldiers forcibly entered her home, physically assaulted her mother and her siblings and confiscated electronic devices including laptops, cameras and mobile telephones.  Her treatment comes after her challenging the presence of the Israeli Defence Forces in her family's courtyard, following the injury of her 15-year-old cousin.  The village in which he lives has been the location of regular protest in which she has played a role because it is illustrative of the growing occupation by Israel, forcing people out of their homes.  For example, water was redirected to a local Israeli settlement, leading to a lack of water for Palestinian farms.  Ahed Tamimi faces 12 charges in a military court, which have grown over time, as a result of her being involved in protests.<\/p><p>The reaction of the right wing is appalling.  The education minister stated that she should end her life in prison.  Ahed Tamimi is still in prison, as is her mother.  She should be released.  Their case illustrates the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli occupation.  Some 8,000 have been arrested, detained or charged with offences in military courts since 2000.  Three out of four of those detained by the Israel Defense Forces experience violence and are the subject of conviction rates of 99% in military courts.  When I was in Gaza seven years ago, I saw some of the instruments of torture used against these children.<\/p> <p> The reality of the relationship between the EU and Israel is demonstrated by a so-called informal meeting at the end of December involving all of the EU ministers for foreign affairs and Benjamin Netanyahu.  It is an incredible relationship which would not happen anywhere else and illustrates that, with the EU-Israel association agreement, Israel is incorporated into the Single Market.  Israeli companies, including military companies, have been the beneficiaries of over $2 billion in the past 20 years in the context of research funding.  That is public funding, some of which ends up with those arms industries.  That relationship has to end.  Ahed Tamimi and her family must be released immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600027#Z01000","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516125300,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I also want to raise the issue of Palestine.  I echo the comments about Ahed Tamimi and the horrendous treatment of a child and her mother protesting against the illegal and immoral occupation of Palestinian territory in defiance of any notion of a two-state solution or international law and yet we continue to allow Israel to effectively act with impunity.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about Gaza, the other part of Palestinian territory, and the shocking humanitarian crisis that is unfolding and worsening there.  We often only talk about Palestine when there is war and places are being bombed to bits.  We talk little about what the disastrous humanitarian consequences are afterwards and the impact that the siege is having on nearly 2 million people in a tiny pocket of land in Gaza.  The facts are shocking.  Some 20% of the housing stock has been destroyed as a result of various Israeli assaults.  A total of 1.3 million people - 70% of the population - are dependent on humanitarian assistance.  Nearly 50% of the people there are food insecure, 55% do not have a consistent energy supply and fewer than 5% have potable piped water.  There is a horrific situation regarding patients trying to get out of Gaza to get medical treatment whereby the number that Israel or the el-Sisi regime in Egypt allows out has been slashed.  Many people in desperate need of medical treatment simply cannot get out of Gaza.  There is no medicine or medical equipment in the hospitals.  The goods that can be transported in or out are tightly controlled, which impacts on medical supplies in particular since Israel claims they are dual-usage and could be used as weapons.  This is a nonsense used to strangle the population into an appalling situation.  Fishermen are only allowed to fish in one third of the fishing waters in which they were supposed to be allowed to fish under the Oslo Accords.  The international community sits by and does nothing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, went to the region last week.  He met Benjamin Netanyahu, the person who is illegally occupying Palestinian territory in defiance of international law and the Geneva Convention.  As a result of the occupation, 2 million people in Gaza are the subject of collective punishment.  The Minister was happy to meet Mr. Netanyahu .  When he went to Gaza, and wrote a very moving blog about what he saw there, he refused to meet the democratically-elected members of the Gaza Parliament.  One line in his blog states that Hamas is deemed an international terrorist group and that we do not deal directly with them.  Benjamin Netanyahu, in the context of what he is doing, is a terrorist by any definition.  Our representatives can meet him no problem and yet they go to Gaza and will not meet the democratically-elected representatives of the people of that territory.  Let us remember that Gaza is in the current humanitarian mess because Israel refused to recognise the outcome of democratic elections over which there was international observation.  They were shown to be absolutely free and fair elections, yet, when our Minister went there, he refused to talk to the representatives in question.  I am not even referring to talking to Hamas.<\/p>  <p>  I want to pass on a direct request from the Gaza Parliament, which has contacted me.  It says it was delighted to see the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in Gaza, but wished that representatives of this democratically-elected Parliament would go and meet representatives of the democratically-elected parliament there or that we might invite the speaker of the Gaza Parliament to this Parliament to talk.  We should listen to the elected representatives of the people of Gaza who are suffering this appalling situation have to say.  That is elementary.  If we can talk to Benjamin Netanyahu - I would rather we did not - then can we also talk to the people who represent the suffering millions in Gaza who are putting up with an appalling situation?  That is a direct question to the Minister of State and the Government.  Will they talk to the elected representatives of the people of Gaza about the disastrous humanitarian situation that the vast majority of that population is suffering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600028#AA00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1516125300,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Clare Daly.  Looking at the agenda from the EU summit, we noticed that security and defence played a big role.  I know we have had a debate on PESCO.  Those of us who have reservations and criticisms about PESCO aired those views.  I hope those reservations and criticism do not come back to haunt us because I believe we are playing with our neutrality.  I do not believe we are respecting it and it has already been undermined by the misuse and abuse of Shannon airport.  We have a significant reputation from our humanitarian role and also our work in securing agreement on the sustainable development goals.  No matter what is said, PESCO is about military capabilities and projects.  How will this be managed?  What will the role of the D&aacute;il be when it comes to these operations?  What sort of say are we going to have?  We have a different role and different relationship with the countries in Central and South America, in Africa and in south-east Asia.  It is different from the relationship that other European countries have with them because many of those European countries were colonial powers and we have to recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  We also see a greater link between security, defence and migration.  We know we have an unprecedented migrant crisis in Europe and a global refugee crisis.  At present, there are 65 million refugees and displaced persons across the globe, the largest number since the Second World War.  President Tusk was talking about preventing new arrivals at external borders and tackling the root causes of migration.  The latter is a very long-term goal but in the meantime we have migrants who are totally at the mercy of unscrupulous traffickers and they are still being returned to detention centres in Libya.  Is there an update on what is happening in those centres in Libya?<\/p>  <p>  Culture and education were discussed.  I would make a particular plea for those migrant young people living in European countries, many of whom are disaffected, and for there to be a way to bring them into the education system because many are not engaging.  The EU is committed to the two-state solution but while it is stating that commitment, as we are speaking here, there is more encroachment with the building of settlements.  The viability of a Palestinian state is being further encroached upon.  I know there were talks and reconciliation is going on between Hamas and Fatah.  I would like to see the EU supporting that and doing more than saying that it is committed to a two-state solution.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland played a role in the Colombian peace process, as did the EU, and I want to bring up the issue of Honduras.  I know it has been brought to the Minister, Deputy Coveney's, attention.  The EU has a delegation in Honduras and there is an EU electoral observation mission there.  It is due to release its report but not for some months and there is much violence in the meantime.  The presidential candidate and Opposition Alliance leader, Salvadar Nasralla, is shown by official data, backed up by considerable evidence, to have had an insurmountable lead prior to the electronic vote management system going offline.  The EU electoral observer mission noted irregularities in the conduct of the election but is not releasing its official report.  Unfortunately, some countries recognise the result even though there were irregularities with the election.  The Organization of American States is calling for fresh elections.<\/p>  <p>  While it was relatively calm over Christmas, violence has resumed.  There has recently been very heavy-handed tactics from the state forces and militias.<\/p><p>I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade called on all sides to be respectful, but one side definitely is not.  Recently eight regional leaders, with one Jesuit who is working with them, were called \"an axis of evil\".  There is the intimidation and harassment of civil society, peasant leaders and environmentalists.  Can Ireland be a progressive voice at EU and UN level in supporting democracy - there was an EU election observation mission - and the citizens of Honduras?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600028#AA00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516125900,"counter":296,"content":"<p>At December's meeting the assembled Ministers discussed migration.  Yet again, we are told the discussion was based on a note circulated by President Tusk which focused on &quot;preventing mass arrivals at external borders and tackling the root causes of the migration crisis&quot;.  In the short time available to me, I would like to raise two subjects that circle the questions of asylum and migration which often result in a red mist descending over western liberal eyes.  They are the position of Julian Assange and the situation in Syria.<\/p><p>Since Julian Assange entered the Ecuadorian embassy in London five years ago and was granted asylum, the focus has drifted from him and his rights under international law; in its place there is a poisonous consensus in both the right-wing and left-wing media that he is in the embassy of his own free will, that he can walk away any time he likes, that the threat posed by the US Government is overstated, that he is just a publicity seeking narcissist and that people who are not great and who have character flaws do not deserve human rights.  The media consensus on this issue is a complete distortion of the reality and an uncritical acceptance of what can only be called UK and US Government propaganda.  <\/p><p>With the spotlight off Julian Assange's human rights, it is up to us to put the issue centre stage.  In February 2016 the working group on arbitrary detentions which falls under the UN's Human Rights Council ruled that Julian Assange, effectively after more than five years of imprisonment, had been deprived of his rights under international law and was the subject of arbitrary detention.  It called for him to be allowed to exercise his right to freedom of movement and be offered compensation for his detention.  The UK and Swedish Governments responded by completing ignoring this call and, in doing so, ignored their obligations under international human rights law.  When the same group issued a decision in 2008 that Aung San Suu Kyi was being held in arbitrary detention, the UK Government, with its European counterparts, were quick to condemn it and call for her release.  <\/p><p>Universal human rights do not mean one law for people we like and another for people we do not.  We should remind our European counterparts of this.  The working group's decision was made two years ago, but the issue of Julian Assange's human rights has faded from public discussion in favour of tidbits about celebrity visitors and involvement in publicising the Democratic National Committee leaks.  There is little discussion of the basic fact that he is bring detained arbitrarily by the United Kingdom in contravention of international law and his right to asylum.  This is all the more surprising given that in April last year the director of the CIA called WikiLeaks &quot;a hostile, non-state intelligence service&quot; and Julian Assange a demon who had no right to the protections of the First Amendment.  In the same month he confirmed that the United States had prepared a warrant for his arrest which it called &quot;a priority&quot;.  It is worrying that the United Kingdom and the United States have manufactured this consensus on human rights and international law and the right to asylum.  The next time the Minister of State sits down with her European counterparts I ask her to make it known that Julian Assange must be allowed to leave the embassy with cast iron guarantees on his release that he can exercise his right to asylum in Ecuador without fearing extradition to an English or an American supermax prison.<\/p><p>One of the root causes of migration is the conflict in Syria.  The way in which the debate is represented in Ireland and across Europe has been incredibly naive and simplistic, as it is portrayed as a debate between good and bad, with a demand that one has to take only one side.  Deputy Mick Wallace and I were criticised for our visit to Syria and call for an end to sanctions which we based on our support for fundamental human rights and decades of evidence that sanctions hurt ordinary people far more than regimes.  However, in some quarters that was somehow filtered through the Syrian distortion filter as expressing support for Bashar al-Assad.  I hope that when the Government goes to the European Union, it will portray the reality of Syrian politics and society which is a kaleidoscope and not black and white.  No society is black and white and it is profoundly wrong and short-sighted of those who are not part of Syrian society to assume entrenched positions on what is happening there.  All we can do is listen to the people whose country it is and be guided by them to support them in their efforts.  It is not for us to impose our will or conception of what is right for them.  That is precisely the paternalism that drove 19th century imperialism and that is driving western interventions in sovereign states, which has led to 65 million people being driven out of their homes.  If we want to help the Syrian people, our only choice is to embrace nuance and avoid at all costs the temptation to assume the right to speak for and represent them.<\/p><p>I refer to the words of a Syrian youth activist who is implacably opposed to both President Assad and ISIS and puts forward a view that is the way forward when he talks about those from outside deciding what is right.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>They are interested in high-politics, not grassroots struggles. They are dealing with grand ideologies and historical narratives, but they don&rsquo;t see people - the Syrian people aren&rsquo;t represented.  They are holding on to depopulated discourses that don&rsquo;t represent human struggle ... We as a people are not merely a tool for the narratives of the western left.  This is our country.  We are not guests.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600029#BB00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1516125900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State a happy new year.<\/p>  <p>  The outcomes of the European Council meeting before Christmas are important and cover many areas.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I will refer mostly to the Brexit negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that significant progress has been made to allow the negotiations to move from phase one to phase two.  The negotiations are important for Ireland and likely to impact one way or another on every parish, workplace and home.  While many in the United Kingdom believe that no deal is better than a bad one, I do not agree.  We all know that the potential consequences of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union could be disastrous.  The confirmation that the United Kingdom has proposed and the European Union has accepted a transition period of two years is good news.  It gives all of our businesses time to get ready and prepare.  This step was hugely significant for Ireland and the rest of the European Union.  The impact of Brexit on Ireland will be significant because of geography, history, trade and so on; therefore every aspect of the negotiations is vital for all of us.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, issues that are unique to Ireland and they have been extremely well recognised by the other member states.  I congratulate all those on the Irish side who worked so hard to explain the position and recognise the solidarity we received from all of these countries.  The Government, the Civil Service and our diplomats played their parts, while Oireachtas Members also made every effort to talk to fellow parliamentarians in other member states to raise issues and explain their context every time they had an opportunity to do so.  A strong consensus was built and our friends supported us, which ended up being important in getting us to where we are now.  However, while all of that was complicated, the next phase will be more difficult as there will be negotiations on a transitional arrangement, a withdrawal agreement and the start of work on the framework for a future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.<\/p><p>The full and final solution which takes into account the particulars of the Irish Border has not been found yet.  We know what the parameters of it are but not how every little piece will work or what exactly regulatory alignment is and in what areas it is needed.  The EU will need to go into all of this with the UK.<\/p> <p> My sense is that if we are to look at the central parts, that is, the customs union and the Single Market, to ensure there is no hard border on this island, we might be better drawing up a list of what is not essential rather than trying to start with what is essential.  We have all seen the reports on the trade, the number of people and, in particular, the volume of milk crossing the Border every day.  There is the example of how Baileys is made, with movement backwards and forwards made possible partly because we all recognise the same standards.  While the European Council noted in its position that the Brexit transition arrangements must suit the EU, it also highlighted its willingness to establish partnerships with the UK in other areas besides trade after Brexit.  This is very helpful.  At the end of the day, there is a lot of excitable talk about all of this but the islands are not moving.  We are still going to be neighbours and we will need to work together on many issues.  With regard to the rest of the issues that were dealt with at the European Council, it is always helpful to continue to co-operate with other member states.  Some of the issues that were discussed are ones where, while it is important Ireland has a different focus and approach because of our military neutrality, we can still co-operate on them.  We need to take care on all of these issues.  The final issues of importance the Council looked at focus on improving co-operation on social, educational and cultural policies.  While we all set our own policies in these areas, we can still learn from each other and try to improve.<\/p> <p> I want to put on the record my compliments and gratitude to all of the members of the committee.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, continued success.  The committee members look forward to working with her in a very proactive way in trying to deal with all of the issues of importance to Ireland post-Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600029#BB00300","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516126500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister of State and everyone in the House a happy new year.  As there was no time to do so on the Order of Business, I did not sympathise on the sad passing of Dolores O'Riordan, the famous singer.  She was an excellent ambassador for Ireland throughout the EU and, indeed, all over the world.  She is a huge loss, not only to her own young children, her family and those in the music industry, but also to us and to her many admirers all over the world.<\/p><p>I am happy to speak on these statements.  It can be taken as a given that, for the foreseeable future there will be only one topic dominating our engagement with the European Council and that, of course, is Brexit.  The agreement reached in December on the first phase of the negotiations is to the credit of the Government.  I have no hesitation in commending the work of the Irish team who worked so hard to get to that point, and I will always give credit where it is due.  Up to that point, the entire process was marked by a chaotic and messy approach whereby both the UK and the EU sides seemed to be working in complete opposition to each other - they were like two horses on a plough that were pulling in different directions.  This created very real fears in this country that the process would generate considerable long-term damage in terms of addressing the need for certainty.<\/p><p>I accept that it has not been easy trying to balance our clear national interests with maintaining respect for the delicate nature of the Good Friday Agreement, for example.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, made some very blunt statements in that regard and I think he was fully justified in being so candid at the time.  It always amazes me when others, particularly those within the EU, seemed totally surprised that the Irish negotiating team would come out fighting for our national interests.  What do they expect us to do?  Are they so used to us asking &quot;How high?&quot; when they say &quot;Jump&quot; that they think we would kowtow to them altogether?  I would remind them we are a sovereign country.  We should not abandon diplomacy but we should certainly not pretend that this process will be anything other than brutal.  I encourage the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and others to be absolutely up-front in their view that we will always put the interests of the Irish people first, as is our duty.<\/p><p>I note from the report on the phase one agreement that both parties, the EU and the UK, have reached agreement in principle across the following three areas under consideration in the first phase of negotiations: protecting the rights of Union citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the Union; the framework for addressing the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland; and the financial settlement.  I also note that progress was made in achieving agreement on aspects of other separation issues under the caveat that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  Where have we heard that before?  It is certainly the crux of the matter.<\/p><p>While progress is being made, there is still the potential for the whole thing to descend into another sorry spectacle.  All it would take is for the ever-increasing political instability in the UK to get to the stage where the more hardline elements of the Leave campaign gain a stronger hold over the Conservative Party.  All of that is outside our control, however.  For now, the only responsible approach is to support the Government, where possible, and try to make the existing agreement as legally binding as we can, particularly with respect to the Border issue and the status of Northern Ireland.  As Professor Cormac Lucey has noted:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland&rsquo;s economic priority is that the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU is as soft as possible.  It is not in our interests for the UK to exit the single market.  It would suit Ireland much better if, outside the EU, the UK opted for similar arrangements to those of Switzerland and Norway, both of which are inside the single market.  It is clearly up to the UK to decide what it wants.  Yet it is of vital national interest that we and the EU encourage as soft a Brexit as possible.<\/blockquote><p>I too compliment Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, the Chairman of the Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Haughey and all the other members on the work they have done.  It has been a very trying time and has not been easy.  Deputy Healy-Rae met all the EU ambassadors and even brought some of them to Kerry, and he gave them a good outline of what is happening here in Ireland.<\/p><p>I see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is wiggling his pen.

Obviously, the main focus in this country in regard to the summit was the Article 50 negotiations, where it was decided that sufficient progress had been made during the first phase of the Brexit negotiations and where guidelines for the second phase of the negotiations were adopted.  However, there were other issues discussed at the summit, including security and defence, the EU pillar of social rights, the EU action plan to tackle the gender pay gap, the concept of European universities, issues in regard to European languages, climate change, Jerusalem, the Russia-Ukraine situation, migration and economic and monetary union.  Like other speakers, I believe we need to be very conscious of the debate taking place on the future of Europe at this time and I appreciate the work the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is doing on that.  I note she is briefing Oireachtas Members this week, there is a major conference in DCU in association with European Movement Ireland and, obviously, there are meetings taking place throughout the country as well.<\/p>  <p>  As regards security and defence, PESCO was launched at the summit.  Some 17 common projects have been agreed so far and I understand further work is needed in that regard.  Will the Minister of State undertake to keep the House briefed on this and assure us that any projects in which we participate will not compromise Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality?<\/p><p>The House needs to be informed every step of the way so that we can scrutinise these projects and give them our agreement if they are compatible with our traditional policy of military neutrality.<\/p> <p> It seems that President Donald Tusk attempted to launch a major review of the EU's migration strategy.  He suggested that we should abandon the mandatory relocation of asylum seekers.

A reform of the Dublin Convention is also envisaged.<\/p> <p> We in this country are somewhat removed from the issues of migration, but I hope that, in any input into the debate that we have, our traditional humanitarian approach will be to the fore and we will seek a humanitarian solution to this problem.

The House agreed that Ireland would join PESCO at the initial stage so that we would have an input into what happened in future and not join later as a third party country.  That was the right course to take.  Since the co-operation involved is in line with the Lisbon treaty, it does not impact on our neutrality.  Nor would we allow it to reach that point.  Politically, there would have to be a referendum to put the question to the people if there were an impact.  We have been clear that, similar to countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden, which are neutrals, the kinds of project in which we will be involved will be maritime surveillance, cybersecurity and strengthening of our current peacekeeping missions.  Ireland and its soldiers have an excellent reputation on peacekeeping missions.  We view PESCO as a mechanism to enhance that as well as our co-operation with other member states.  The climate has changed.  As the Taoiseach outlined, we need to be able to co-operate with other member states on tackling terrorism, cybercrime and drug trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  I see no reason not to keep the House updated on those missions in which we take part.  None of them will impact on our neutrality.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding migration, the EU and Ireland as a part of it have adopted a broad range of measures.  We are engaging with countries of origin and transit to try to address the root causes of migration.  We have agreed to a plan relocating migrants in Italy and Greece across the EU.  We have launched the EUNAVFOR Med, or Operation Sophia, and have provided substantial financial assistance to countries that are hosting large numbers of migrants.<\/p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting, leaders held an informal discussion on migration.  No conclusion was reached.  Currently, the two schools of thought are whether countries that have given substantial amounts of funding should also have to take in substantial numbers of migrants and whether specific figures should be allocated to specific countries.

Jerusalem was discussed at the Council meeting, but I would like a response on the issue of Gaza.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can tell us much about what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, did there last week.  He met some people, but they were linked to one faction, namely, the Ramallah-based Government, and so he should have.  However, that he did not meet elected representatives from Gaza itself is a problem.  Let us remember that Gaza was the trigger for the Israeli assaults.  Israel did not accept the outcome of a democratic election and then attacked.  Last week, the Minister saw some of the consequences of that.  He was clearly aware of them, yet he has reinforced the Israeli position by not talking to the representatives of the people of Gaza.  It legitimises Israel's position, which we should not do.  At the very least, we should be balanced.  Some reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah is now happening.<\/p>  <p>  I have received a direct request from the Speaker of the elected representatives in the Gaza Parliament for us to send an all-party delegation to Gaza to meet them or for us to invite the Speaker to the Oireachtas.  We should do that if we are serious about talking to all sides.  According to the request, since Ireland has incredible credibility among all Palestinian factions, there is nothing that we could propose that they would not seriously consider.  That puts us in a privileged position.  We should use our credibility to talk to the political representatives in Gaza.  The Government should consider doing so, given the appalling and intolerable humanitarian situation there.  I was told about some of it and the statistics show more.  Anecdotally, people are suffering bad health conditions - for example, kids and others in need of dialysis and new kidneys - but they cannot get out to get treatment.  Apparently, kidneys are being sold for &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 in Cairo, but someone needs &euro;5,000 to bribe an Egyptian guard to get out through Rafah.  That is how it works.  The number of people being allowed out for medical reasons has reduced significantly.<\/p>  <p>  We need to intervene.  We have a great deal of credibility.

As the Deputy said, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, represented Ireland at the One Planet summit in Paris on 12 December, the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Paris Agreement.  He reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to the global objectives of that agreement and supported the call for ambitious contributions to managing global emissions from the international shipping sector.  This was reaffirmed at the European Council meeting and member states reaffirmed the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  We are happy to provide the relevant information to the Oireachtas committee.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions on PESCO, involvement in various projects is on an opt-out basis.  It is not that we are specifically tied to any of the programmes or projects; we can opt in or opt out.  As I mentioned earlier, cybersecurity is an area in which we feel we can contribute in the context of combatting terrorism.  We know that terrorism has changed in its format and is not what is was 20 years ago.  There is a lot of terrorist activity happening online through cybersecurity attacks, through YouTube videos aimed at brainwashing people and so forth.  We feel that we can co-operate and work with various member states in that regard.  <\/p>  <p>  On the question of expenditure, we are looking at a 2% increase of each individual member state's defence expenditure but that is an overall figure.  Ireland will not necessarily have to increase its budget by 2%.  If France, for example, were to increase its budget by more than 2%, then Ireland could increase its expenditure by less than 2%.  However, we would seek to ensure that any money expended on our behalf is spent in areas that we feel fit with Ireland's profile, that such spending does not impact on our neutrality and that it is in line with what we have already agreed in signing up to PESCO.<\/p>  <p>  I accompanied the Taoiseach to Brussels for the December European Council, as he indicated earlier.  I will focus my concluding remarks on social, educational and cultural co-operation and migration, which were all discussed on Thursday, 14 December.  Following on from the social summit in Gothenburg in November, discussions continued at the European Council on social, educational and cultural co-operation between member states.  These are areas in which member states have primary responsibility but where the Union plays an important role in co-ordination, co-operation and sharing best practice while fully respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  This debate is central to Europe's future.  Education and culture are key to building inclusive and cohesive societies and to sustaining our competitiveness.  The aim is to ensure that as we continue to develop and co-operate economically we also protect and promote social standards and labour rights.  The Taoiseach intervened in the European Council on these issues, including to express his view that the social pillar allows us to go back to the founding principles of the social market economy.  He highlighted several elements, including pension rights and student cards, noting the need to focus on specific initiatives, to set timelines for them to happen and to monitor implementation.  President Macron of France has also been very vocal in this debate and the Taoiseach supported the President's proposal for a network of European universities.  The European Council will come back to these matters in March 2018 to ensure that there is a follow up.<\/p>  <p>  Migration was discussed over dinner and there was a useful exchange on the internal and external dimensions in an effort to explore how best to achieve and effect a substantial policy which would respect the concepts of responsibility and solidarity.  Key to this is working with countries of origin and transit in Africa and the Middle East and building on our development assistance in order to do this.  As intended, this was an open ended discussion with no conclusions but it was agreed to come back to this issue with an ambition to be able to take some decisions by June.<\/p>  <p>  The leaders also discussed President Trump's decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and agreed to restate the EU's common position, with which the Taoiseach agreed, that EU embassies will remain in Tel Aviv.  The European Council also expressed its opposition to actions that undermine the viability of the two state solution.  There was also a quick exchange about Russia and Ukraine, with the leaders agreeing to a roll over of the sanctions on Russia.  These will now be renewed when they fall later this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600032#EE00600","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1516127700,"counter":318,"content":"<p>That concludes our discussion on the European Council meeting, pursuant to Standing Order No. 111.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600032#EE00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed) - Priority Questions","time":1516127700,"counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600032#EE00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1516127700,"counter":321,"content":"<p>We will now move on to questions to the Minister for Rural and Community Development.

Actions under this pillar are implemented across a number of Departments and agencies.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is delivering a number of funding initiatives which I will continue to deliver in 2018.  For example, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the maintenance, enhancement and promotion of existing outdoor recreation infrastructure.  In 2016 and 2017, the scheme facilitated the development of greenways, blueways, walks and other trails across the country.  This scheme will continue to support important local, regional and national rural recreation projects in 2018.  In addition, the Department will work closely with Coillte to ensure the long-term maintenance and development of recreational infrastructure on Coillte lands for public use.  My Department administers the walks scheme, under which landowners receive modest payments to maintain sections of national waymarked trails and other priority walks that cross their lands.  Some 39 trails are covered by the scheme, under which approximately 1,900 landowners receive payments.  A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to double the number of walks on the scheme.

I am conscious that there has been a significant growth in the number of people engaging in outdoor pursuits across a wider range of activities.

In the case of the local improvement schemes, funding could be drawn down once it had been confirmed by a local authority that 50% of its works had been completed and that all works would be fully completed by 31 December 2017.<br\/><br\/><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><br\/><br\/>In the case of the outdoor rural recreation infrastructure scheme, town and village renewal scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme, local authorities were required to spend at least 20% of the total project cost before the first tranche payment of 50% of their allocation under the respective scheme could be drawn down.  The balance of funding will only be paid on full completion of the projects in question.<br\/><br\/>The Revised Estimate for Public Services 2018 provides for gross expenditure of &euro;239.2 million, comprising &euro;144 million for current expenditure and &euro;95.2 million for capital expenditure, including the &euro;7.7 million carryover, in respect of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The large increase in current expenditure takes into account provision from the community services programme, which transferred at the beginning of this year to my Department from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>My Department will continue to work with key stakeholders, including local authorities, community and voluntary groups and key agencies, to support job creation, attract tourism investment and contribute to long-term economic development in rural Ireland.

The development of a network of regionally based public banks could be a game changer for small and medium enterprises, agribusiness and the regions. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland's efforts in the midlands, especially counties Westmeath and Longford, have been abysmal, shambolic and disappointing, to say the least.

Of 210,000 IDA supported jobs nationwide, only 4,327 are in the midlands.  This equates to 2% of total jobs and the figure appears to worsen every year.  It is time the Government took urgent corrective action, particularly in the midlands region, including my constituency of Longford Westmeath.  The proposal to establish a midlands public bank in Mullingar as a pilot for a national network of regional public banks would go a considerable way towards making up for the failures of IDA Ireland.

They were protesting about the quality of care that they are able to give to patients in that facility.  I have visited patients at this facility for a long time but it has not been updated.  It requires significant capital expenditure and investment in staff.<\/p><p>Staff are put to the pin of their collar.  It is unfair to staff and to patients that the current situation would be allowed to continue.  Yesterday, there were 51 patients in a 44-bed unit.  Patients were being admitted to sit on chairs on which they were asked to stay and sleep while waiting for a psychiatric service, and that is not good enough.  The staff attended that protest in their own time.  They did not vacate the wards.  They came in from their lunch breaks to highlight what they see as being an unfair system and very poor care for the patient.<\/p> <p> Some of those there for the long term are in an inappropriate setting.  They are waiting for placement elsewhere.  People cannot get counselling services.  Some patients are being told they will have to wait for three to six months before they are seen.  If one is in a community setting outside the hospital, the same waiting list prevails.  How can one tell someone who is in a crisis regarding mental health that he or she will have to wait for three to six months?  There are volunteer organisations on the ground, such as Taxi Watch founded by Derek Devoy.  It monitors those who may be on the verge of suicide and brings them to the attention of relevant services.  What can the services do when they are underfunded, understaffed and under pressure in the department of psychiatry?  I am not saying that for political purposes.  Those central to delivering the care are saying it.  The HSE is referring patients who are looking for counselling services to Teac Tom, a voluntary organisation in Kilkenny city.  It provides immediate, on-the-spot counselling services but the HSE refuses to pay for the service because it believes it is referring the individual to a service that is run on a voluntary basis.  How can that be?  How can the Minister of State allow that to continue?  I stood on that picket line with a friend of mine, a councillor, Joe Malone, who is associated with the care of those who need care for their mental health and well-being.<\/p> <p> What will the Minister of State do to provide capital expenditure and the needed staffing requirements?  What plans are there to extend the department of psychiatry?  When will an extension or refurbishment of that centre be provided for?  This has gone on for a long time and someone has to cry stop before we have another death by suicide.  It is that critical.  I invite the Minister of State to visit the service, to visit Teac Tom and to talk to Derek Devoy in the other service, and to see first-hand what is going on in the department of psychiatry.  We also need investment in the management of that service.  It is deplorable that the managers of a service cannot see the issues confronting their staff and that the management is not planning ahead for the numbers attending the service and the staffing levels required.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that the same circumstances prevail with the Waterford services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600041#OO01900","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516133700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this important question.  I know from his work in Kilkenny that he cares passionately about mental health services.  Carlow-Kilkenny mental health services focus on delivering a broad range of primary and community-based services as well as specialised services for children, adults and older people.  These services are provided in a number of different settings, including the individual's own home, inpatient facilities, outpatient clinics, acute day services, day hospitals and day centres, and high, medium and low support community accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The 44-bed department of psychiatry based in St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, is the designated approved centre for acute inpatient services in the area of Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary.  This enables all acute inpatient admissions to be managed at a single site.  Referrals to the department of psychiatry are through a consultant psychiatrist who makes the clinical decision to admit based on the level of acute presentation or need.  I am pleased to say that I am informed by the HSE that there are no waiting lists for admission to the acute inpatient service.  The HSE acknowledges that at times there can be issues of over-capacity at the department of psychiatry, which I take the Deputy's point about.  When this occurs, all additional controls relating to risk management are applied.  This includes ensuring that staffing levels are at an appropriate level.  Regarding staffing, a number of posts are with the national recruitment service to be filled and are currently being filled in a temporary capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the department of psychiatry, a dedicated psychiatric liaison team operates from the emergency department in St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital.  All service users presenting to the emergency department who require psychiatric assessment will receive that assessment within agreed timeframes in line with the relevant department of psychiatry or emergency department guidelines.  Onward referral pathways are agreed with all service users upon completion of a psychiatric assessment in the emergency department.  Pathways can include admission to an acute unit, referral to a relevant community mental health service team or referral back to a person's own general practitioner.<\/p>  <p>  In line with A Vision for Change and Mental Health Commission recommendations, there have been significant developments in the area of community mental health services.  The comprehensive development of community mental health teams has brought together key professionals to provide a wide range of mental health interventions on a multidisciplinary basis to service users in the community.  This approach is based on assessment of a person's needs.  The HSE has assured me that any waiting times for community mental health teams are in line with the national key performance indicator requirements.  In addition, the development of the home-based services teams in Carlow and Kilkenny has ensured the delivery of a service that facilitates recovery in the service user's own home environment.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to have the opportunity to share with the Deputy the continuing steps being taken to improve mental health services in this area.  The Carlow-Kilkenny mental health service is engaging in the reform programme to realign services to primary care networks in line with national policy.  The aim is to facilitate integration of services and to seek to provide a seamless service to service users.  In addition, there is a significant focus on the involvement of the service user in the management of his or her illness, through initiatives such as involvement centres and a recovery college.  I hope this information has addressed the issues raised by the Deputy to his satisfaction.  I will report back on the other issues he has raised with me to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600042#PP00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1516133700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>That is not good enough.

How can he say to a family waiting for a counsellor for three to six months that is satisfactory?  I respect that the note the Minister of State read was probably given to him by the HSE.  It is a load of nonsense.  It is not true.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland went out on a picket line - its members went out on a protest march.  They did not do that for fun.

I ask the Minister of State to come and see it for himself.  He should visit it and see the capital expenditure that is needed.  It is obvious.  Will he please explain to me why the HSE can outsource its counselling service to a voluntary organisation and not pay for it?  It is reprehensible that our Government would stand by and watch what is going on in the south east and in the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's General Hospital and not do something about it.

It is not just that the Minster of State is not prepared to do so.  The HSE and the Department are also not prepared to do so because they wrote the briefing note for him.  They have, therefore, told a story that is absolutely misleading.  The Minister of State should meet union representatives and talk to them about this.  He should visit the hospital and at least acknowledge the fact that something has to be done.

In Kilkenny, there is significant focus on meaningful involvement of the service users in the management of their illnesses with the development of recovery-focused services.  Six actions are being undertaken: the development of involvement centres, which are peer-led support services located in Carlow and Kilkenny; the development of a recovery college that delivers programmes for people who have lived experience in mental health; the delivery of wellness recovery action planning, WRAP, which is a programme to help people to manage their mental health; a class programme that supports service users and their relatives; projects, which focus on recovery from mental ill-health; and service user forums, which facilitate service users to feed back on service delivery and development of service initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about major problems emerging.  It is important that Ministers see what is happening first hand and that they engage with psychiatric nurses.  I am very much open to that.

That process is questionable when it comes to orphan drug assessments.  A review into all orphan drugs is under way and that should be welcomed by all parties in the House.  Even though Kuvan is readily available in most European countries, it is not available for those living with PKU in Ireland.  The drug has the potential to transform a person living with PKU.

This ensures that reimbursement decisions will be made on objective scientific and economic grounds.  Medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and is expected to increase again in the years ahead.  That is why the challenge is ensuring access to new and innovative medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p>  <p>  Kuvan was first assessed in 2009 under the national pricing and reimbursement process at that time.  However, it was concluded that insufficient evidence was available to support the pricing arid reimbursement application submitted by the then promoter, Merck Serono.  In December 2015, Merck Serono advised the HSE that the market authorisation for Kuvan was to be transferred to BioMarin in 2016.  The HSE met the new market authorisation holder in May 2016 and was advised that the company would be submitting a new pricing and reimbursement application relating to this medicine.  The new application was assessed by the NCPE in September 2017 and, in its report to the HSE, it did not recommend Kuvan for reimbursement because it was not deemed cost-effective.  However, I would like to make it clear that the HSE leadership, which is the ultimate decision-making authority on reimbursement decisions, has yet to make a decision on the new pricing and reimbursement application submitted by BioMarin.  The HSE met the company recently to discuss the report from the NCPE and to explore commercial options.  The Department of Health has been advised that the HSE drugs group and the HSE leadership are expected to consider all relevant information, including any commercially confidential offering during the first quarter of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600043#QQ00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1516134300,"counter":462,"content":"<p>All Members received an email from the PKU Association of Ireland earlier.

In 1996 fuair an Gaelscoil aitheantas buan.<\/p>  <p>  Gaelscoil Chluain Meala was founded in 1994 and received provisional approval in that year.  Two years later, in 1996, it was granted permanent recognition by the Department but today, 23 years later, there is huge frustration in the school community because of the huge delay in progressing the building of a new school for Gaelscoil Chluain Meala.  Progress has been tortuously slow over those years.  The school is currently accommodated in an 1830 building which was used in more recent times by South Tipperary County Council as part of its engineering and stores offices; indeed, I worked there myself when I worked with South Tipperary County Council in both the stores section and the planning section.  As it is very old, the building is totally unsuitable and not fit for purpose.  Classrooms are overcrowded, playground space is extremely limited and toilet facilities are inadequate.  There are no parking facilities and the building is damp and difficult to heat, with poor ventilation - the list goes on.<\/p>  <p>  When the school was established in that building, it was thought that in a short number of years the school would be located in a new building but, as I said, progress has been tortuously slow.  The school started with 45 pupils and two teachers whereas it now has 210 pupils and 11 teachers.  It has been promised on a number of occasions that construction would start.  For example, in November 2015 it was indicated that it was in the programme and that construction would commence in 2017 but that has not happened.  The current situation, as I said, is that there are 210 students, 11 teachers, support staff, clerical staff, cleaning staff and caretaking staff in the school, as well as a na&iacute;onra.  It is long past time that this school would be given approval and that construction would commence.  We are aware the capital programme will be announced in the coming weeks.  The school is asking for confirmation that the new school building will be funded in that capital programme and that construction will commence in 2018, as is urgently needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600044#RR00300","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1516134900,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the D&aacute;il the current position in regard to the major building project for Gaelscoil Chluain Meala.  The major building project for this school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 2b - that is, the detailed design stage - which includes securing the statutory approvals, such as planning permission, fire certificate and disability access certificate, and the preparation of tender documents.  These have all been completed and the design team has submitted written confirmation that it is satisfied that the tender documents are complete, correct and in compliance with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and Department of Education and Skills tender documentation requirements.  This project is included on the six-year programme announced on 17 November 2015 to go to tender and construction.<\/p>  <p>  Gaelscoil Chluain Meala is a co-educational school.  The project brief is for the refurbishment and renovation of the existing primary school, which is a protected structure.  It is to include eight classrooms, shared spaces, library, ancillary accommodation and staff parking.  The project comprises repairs to the existing building and the construction of a new eight-classroom extension, including a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the funding pressures on the capital programme and the need to focus limited funding on the provision of additional school places to cater for demographic demands.  The Department's overall capital allocation for 2017 was &euro;693 million, of which &euro;531 million was expended on the schools capital programme.  This included completion of 46 major school building projects, along with expenditure on smaller additional accommodation projects, emergency and summer works, site acquisitions and the payment of a minor maintenance grant to all primary schools.  The Department is currently reviewing its programme for capital expenditure in 2018 and into 2019.

Almost &euro;1.7 billion has issued to farmers in that time, which is the highest amount ever paid.  Indeed, Ireland leads other member states in terms of our implementation of the rural development programme and has the second highest drawdown rate of EU funds.<\/p>  <p>  GLAS is the most popular scheme ever run under a rural development programme in Ireland.  The original target of 50,000 participants was surpassed well ahead of the target date, such is the popularity of the scheme.  Given that the first approvals under the scheme run from 1 October 2015, it is a remarkable achievement to have exceeded this target within a period of 15 months.<\/p>  <p>  GLAS has a maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000 under the general scheme with provision for a payment of up to &euro;7,000, known as GLAS+, where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments in a limited number of cases.  Last year, we paid out almost &euro;200 million under GLAS and have continued payments each week into the new year.<\/p>  <p>  Like previous agri-environment schemes, GLAS supports participants in improving their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  The scheme delivers overarching benefits to the rural environment and addresses the issues of the mitigation of the impacts of climate change, the enhancement of biodiversity and the improvement of water quality.  It provides valuable support to participants who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that enhance the sustainability credentials of Irish agriculture.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is co-funded by the national Exchequer and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  As required under EU regulation, two payments issue in respect of each year, these being, the advance payment followed at a later stage by a balancing payment.  In 2016 and again in 2017, the advance payment represented 85% of the annual payment with the balancing payment being 15%.  In 2017, advance payments commenced on schedule in November and continue to be made on an ongoing basis as tranches of cases are cleared.<\/p>  <p>  There are 49,700 active participants in GLAS.  By the end of this week, more than 40,000 of these will have received their 2017 advance payments, valued at &euro;161 million.  This represents over 87% of farmers eligible for a 2017 advance payment.<\/p>  <p>  In more than 3,000 of the outstanding cases, applicants remain ineligible for payment until they complete the steps that they must take before the Department can process their payments.  There is nothing that we can do to advance these payments until the applicants complete their obligations.  In most of these cases, this relates to outstanding documentation, which they must submit.  As soon as this is received and assuming everything is in order, my Department will move immediately to issue payments.<\/p>  <p>  The main issues include the need for advisers to submit farm nutrient management plans to the dedicated online system, commence commonage management plans in the case of participants with a commonage action and submit the required documentation in the case of the low-emission slurry spreading and rare breed actions.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, many of these payments are not delayed, as has been suggested.  It is simply the case that it is not possible for the Department to make them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600045#SS01000","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1516136100,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Deputies Ferris and Michael Healy-Rae have one minute each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600046#TT00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516136100,"counter":480,"content":"<p>It is hard to know who to believe here, to be quite honest.  <i>AgriLand.ie<\/i>reports that the Department is arguing that the agricultural consultants, ACs, are being unfair to it, as are people like myself and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, who raise these issues in the House in the interests of the people we represent, particularly the small farmers who are trying to survive on very marginal land.

However, one of the most scandalous and recurring components of the crisis afflicting our health service is that of patients being left waiting on trolleys in emergency departments across the State.  In 2017, a record 98,981 patients were left to spend one night or more on a trolley in hospitals throughout this State.  This is the worst ever recorded number of such patients.  The health service is under huge strain following cuts made to its budgets during the austerity years and the lack of sustained investment to meet the growing and changing needs of our population.  Two of the main consequences of this are a chronic lack of capacity within our acute hospitals and a shortage of staff.  For many years now medical and health care professionals have been working tirelessly in hospitals around the country with fewer resources, supports and funding.  In spite of the brave work of these medical and health care professionals, the crisis of patients on trolleys has recurred year on year, worsening all the while.  The scandal of patients waiting on trolleys was officially declared an emergency by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, in 2006 when the trolley count reached 469.  Twelve years later, on 3 January 2018, 677 patients were left on trolleys, the highest number ever recorded.  These are not just statistics; they are human beings - grandparents, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters.  <\/p><p>This crisis happens because we have neither the capacity nor the staff to deal with the volume of patients presenting at our emergency departments and acute hospitals.  OECD data confirm that our acute public hospitals operate at 95% occupancy, which is far above the acceptable OECD average of 77%.  An occupancy rate of 77% is what is needed to provide a safe, consistent and effective standard of patient care.  The Irish Association of Emergency Medicine has calculated that there could be between 300 and 350 patient deaths each year due to the trolley crisis and emergency unit overcrowding.  In the past decade, acute hospital inpatient bed numbers were cut when they should have been increased in line with the country's growing and ageing population.  Last May the Department of Health commenced a national bed capacity review, which was due to be published before the end of 2017.  Oireachtas Members still have not seen the final report but sections of the media clearly have seen it.  That is disrespectful to people in this House and to those working in the health service.<\/p><p>Accompanying this crisis of capacity is a crisis of recruitment and retention.  It is always worth noting that the recruitment moratorium in the public sector was introduced in the health service two years before all other areas in the public sector.  Unions representing workers in the health service have been highlighting the issue of recruitment and retention for a number of years now.  Indeed, the report of the Public Service Pay Commission identifies problems in recruiting and retaining staff, most especially in the health service.  In December 2008 there were 38,108 whole-time equivalent nurses and midwives in the HSE but at the end of September 2017 that stood at just 36,170.  The fallout from this is that to deal with the shortage of nurses, the health service is overly reliant on costly agency staff, with the bill for agency nursing running at &euro;1.1 million per week.  The Minister has agreed with me on more than one occasion that this does not represent good value for money but not only does it continue, it gets bigger every year.  <\/p><p>Similarly, hospital consultants comprise less than 2.5% of the public health service workforce, which is significantly less than the percentage of consultants in the health services of peer countries.  In 2003, the Hanly report recommended that this country should have 3,600 consultants by 2012, but there were just 2,951 whole-time equivalent consultants operating in the HSE at the end of September 2017.  The practice of hiring doctors who are not on the specialist register to act as consultants is another feature of the chaos in recruitment and retention.  The staffing crisis has created a severely challenging working environment in which nurses and doctors routinely work beyond their contracted hours to ensure patients are cared for.  This often happens at a significant physical, mental and financial cost to those involved and their family members and friends.<\/p> <p> Solutions are required to stabilise the situation in the short term.  We need to ensure the emergency department task force works on a permanent basis to monitor the situation across the country and report on problems that need to be tackled proactively.  The Government needs to ensure as a matter of urgency that all beds closed during the austerity years are reopened.  This has to mean setting targets and putting funds aside to ensure those targets are met.  If we are to deal with the increasing population and the changing demographics, we need to start building additional capacity into the acute hospital sector.  This should be reflected in the Ireland 2040 plan.  The underlying difficulties causing this crisis, including working conditions, facilities, supports, training opportunities, promotion opportunities and pay, must be tackled so we can address the recruitment and retention crisis across all grades in the health service.  Workers and their representative organisations must be consulted on how to address these issues.  We must find a new way forward to resolve the recruitment and retention crisis.  We cannot pretend the issue of pay is not a factor.  I suggest that if this aspect of the problem is to be overcome, the Government should establish a commission on pay in the health service for medical professionals and health care workers.  If these issues are not addressed, we will not be able to recruit more staff into the health service.<\/p> <p> A broader awareness campaign is needed to ensure the public is aware of what should and should not be brought to accident and emergency departments.  As part of this approach, the Government needs to hasten the move towards primary and community care and ensure all primary care centres are adequately resourced with new staff and funding.  The Minister and I have discussed a primary care centre in my constituency on many occasions.  It is not good enough that the HSE has said it will not allocate any additional staff to the centre.  It is possible that new GPs will go into it, but I am concerned with HSE staff.  Some patients are often left in acute care, which is not in their best interests, when they could and should be cared for at home.  It is clear that increased investment in transitional care beds, adequate step-down facilities, home care packages and home help hours would help to ensure all patients who can be moved home, or to a more appropriate setting, are relocated in such a manner.  While many of the measures called for in the motion before the House seek to stabilise the trolley crisis in the short term, we also need to address the systematic problems in the long term.  This can be done if there is sufficient political will to implement in full all the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600046#TT01500","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516136700,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Health care should be a right for all citizens and not a privilege for the well-off.  Need, not means, must be the philosophy underpinning our approach to health.  The public health system should be free at the point of delivery, based on need and funded by progressive taxation.  The Government is opposed to this.  It does not support the duty of the State to provide public services.  The approach of the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il involves the privatisation of the health service, or at least those bits of it on which a profit can be made.  That is why the health service is in a perpetual state of crisis.  That is why the Government does not engage in the essential restructuring needed to provide a health service that is fit for purpose and is free to citizens at the point of delivery.  It is no longer extraordinary to hear stories of elderly people, children and very sick people being left on trolleys.  These harrowing tales are now part of the everyday narrative of life for ordinary people in this State.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, a record 98,981 patients were left to spend one night or more on trolleys in hospitals in this State.  This represents the biggest number of trolley nights ever recorded.  Last week, there were 126 patients on trolleys at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which is in my own constituency of Louth.  There were 31 people on trolleys on Wednesday alone.  The equivalent figure for yesterday was 27 and for today it is 29.  After seven years in power, Fine Gael has had plenty of time to take account of all of this by preparing a service plan that meets the needs of patients.  I listened to the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il debating these matters in the Chamber earlier today.  I heard two failed health Ministers trying to score points off each other, like two bald men fighting over a comb.  They made no sense at all.  This country's nursing and medical staff and all the other health workers are doing a tremendous job, but they cannot cope.  They should not be blamed for the mess that has been made of the health service by the successive health policies and strategies of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  This crisis will not simply blow over.  If this awful mess is to be sorted out in a socially just way, a definite and definitive change in policy is required.  That does not mean a patched-up version of the current two-tier system.  There needs to be a radically transformed wraparound health service that delivers care for all citizens from the cradle to the grave.  As we heard when Deputy O'Reilly outlined some of the propositions she is bringing forward, this must mean ending the trolley crisis in our accident and emergency departments through proper investment and resourcing of community care.  It must also involve the introduction of a new single integrated hospital waiting list management system, which allows people to move from one hospital to another to reduce waiting times.  It also means recruiting doctors and nurses to reverse the cutbacks in staffing numbers that were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party in recent years.  I do not envy the Minister, Deputy Harris, in doing his job.  I do not doubt that he is doing his best and will continue to do so.  Despite his best endeavours, however, he will not resolve the crisis in our health services because he is looking at the wrong problem.  I say that with such certainty because I know the Minister is not trying to create a genuine public health service.  I appeal to him to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600047#UU00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1516136700,"counter":495,"content":"<p>A number of years ago, harsh winters put increased pressure on accident and emergency departments across the country.  The seasonal pressures on accident and emergency departments that were evident some years ago are now a crisis that manifests itself all year round.  Why do patients, some of whom are very elderly, have to wait for unreasonable and extremely long times in accident and emergency departments?  Why do they have to spend so much time lying on trolleys or sitting in chairs placed around accident and emergency departments?  Among the many factors that have given rise to the continuous trolley crisis and the crisis in our accident and emergency departments are capacity issues and the constant brain drain of doctors, nurses and other highly trained medical staff.  The lack of consultants and the subsequent cancellation of operations has added to this chaos.  It is a scandal that we are exporting our doctors to other countries where conditions and pay are better.<\/p>  <p>  Poor political decisions are important factors in the creation of this crisis.  The lack of political will to resolve the growing scandals in our hospitals on the part of this Government and its predecessors has allowed the trolley crisis and the crisis in our accident and emergency departments to grow to the point where they are seemingly out of control.  Our health system is poorly organised.  When funds and resources are not put to good use, it leads to a reliance on acute public hospitals.  This places an additional burden on the shoulders of hospital staff, who are over-stretched, hard-working and dedicated.  Poor decision-making has led to a lack of primary health care centres.  The development and resourcing of community care would help to alleviate the crisis in our emergency departments.  All of this is giving rise to a systematic failure in our health service provision.  It is an indication of a health system that is not fit for purpose and is unable to cope with the health requirements of the population.  The INMO recently recorded the highest-ever number of patients on trolleys.  Apart from the hardship of having to lie on a trolley for hours on end, such excessive delays in accident and emergency departments give rise to additional risks to patients, especially those who are elderly or vulnerable.  Political will, leadership and proper resourcing are required to end the crisis in our accident and emergency departments and on our hospital trolleys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600047#UU00300","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1516136700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.

Jay's ambulance bypassed St. Colmcille's Hospital, where the 24-hour accident and emergency department has been closed, and brought him to a trolley lined corridor at St. Vincent's Hospital.  This is another failure by the Government and the Minister's colleagues in the previous Government, including Labour Party Ministers.  At the same time, the Government is railroading through the closure of St. Brigid's nursing home in Crooksling, a critical step-down facility that has provided excellent service to people in west County Wicklow and the Brittas area for many years.

Last Thursday, security staff entered an area of Tallaght Hospital known as \"the pod\".  Management then arrived and informed those present that the area was being redesignated as an adult area.  The staff protested but were effectively asked to go away.  They had to complete their work without access to this space.  Some were told this was part of a two-day trial but that they should plan for the area to be redesignated permanently as an adult area.  During the redesignation, I received reports that space could not be found for extremely sick children who had been brought to the hospital.  These included patients with severe neurological conditions and one patient who may have cancer.  Other sick children were then shunted out to public corridors.  In one case, a five year old on a drip was left sitting on a chair on the main corridor of the department.  Will the Minister confirm that this incident took place?  Will the redesignation be permanent or is it a temporary measure to address difficulties being experienced in the hospital?<\/p>  <p>  Children should not be left on trolleys.  This practice gives rise to safety and personal dignity issues.  I once observed a woman dying on a hospital corridor surrounded by family members.  It was an awful experience and I am sure Deputies will be able to relate similar experiences.<\/p>  <p>  It does not make sense to close down step-down facilities while cases such as those described by Deputies are taking place.  St. Brigid's nursing home, which serves the Dublin South-West constituency and Wicklow, is a fantastic facility that is about to be closed.  At the same time, families are telling us they cannot find nursing homes that will take in their loved ones who are in hospitals such as that in Tallaght.  The reason for this is the high demand for such services.  Much could be done if we sought collectively to address the problem.  We must do things differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600048#VV00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1516137300,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the D&aacute;il on the important issue of hospital overcrowding and thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly for facilitating the debate through the motion.  I would like to approach this debate in a spirit of finding solutions and forging cross-party consensus.  I appreciate that Deputy O'Reilly put forward a number of constructive suggestions.  I am also conscious of the need for all of us to work together to reach a sustainable solution for the health service, placing patients and their needs at its heart.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will not oppose the motion because we all want the same thing, namely, to do better by patients and front-line staff.  However, there are a number of aspects of the motion that the Government contests and I will deal with these in the course of my address.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody in the House considers it acceptable that we have high numbers of patients on trolleys waiting for long times in overcrowded emergency departments in conditions that are awful for them and the staff looking after them.  I do not claim, nor does anyone in Government or the Health Service Executive, that the difficulties that arise immediately after new year are not predictable.  We had detailed plans and extra resources in place for this reason.  However, we still hit a surge that was extremely challenging for the health system.  There is a difference between predictable and avoidable and the latter requires that we break the cycle of overcrowding.  This will not be achieved in one year's winter plan.<\/p>  <p>  I will first focus on this year's winter plan.  I assure everyone that the Government is committed to investing in health and investment is having an impact.  We do not often hear this but some things are going well in the health service.  This year, as part of budget 2018, an extra &euro;30 million was made available to respond to winter pressures, with a further &euro;40 million being provided in 2018.  Let me share something that Deputies may not have heard this winter.  In the face of increased demand, staff across the country continue working to improve performance.  The overall number of patients on trolleys over the whole winter so far, that is, from 1 November 2017 to 1 January 2018, has declined by more than 2,000 year on year.  While far too many patients spend time on trolleys, staff are making an impact with the extra resources provided.  The decline is the result of progress made in November, when the counts undertaken by the INMO and the HSE both acknowledged a significant decrease on the previous year.  In December, the HSE's TrolleyGAR also showed a significant decrease on the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  Measures such as expanded access to transitional care have meant 382 patients were approved for such care between 1 and 10 January.  This has come about as a result of investment.  Additional access to diagnostics out of hours has been provided as a result of investment.  Investment in more home care has delivered a significant reduction in the number of delayed discharges.  In addition, 80 patients are receiving care in private hospitals as a result of a decision to adopt a proposal made by Deputy Kelly last year to use all available capacity across the health service.  While these measures have not been sufficient, they have had an impact.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also provided &euro;25 million for social care, including more home care supports and packages.  It also provided &euro;1.4 million for rehabilitation and step-down beds in Limerick and Cork and money to deal with complex case discharges to allow people to return to the community.  We have opened additional beds at the national rehabilitation hospital and a day hospital is planned at Cashel.  Moreover, the HSE's winter plan included a communication strategy, as called for in the motion.  The strategy incorporated a public information campaign to increase awareness of the different approaches to accessing services, including emergency services, over the winter period.  I must, therefore, counteract the narrative that there was a failure to predict or plan for what has occurred.<\/p>  <p>  We need more beds to reduce the unacceptable number of patients who are still ending up on trolleys.  This winter, we are opening an additional 227 beds and the capacity report will inform our plans for further increasing capacity.  As of today, nearly 150 additional beds have been opened in Beaumont Hospital, St. James's Hospital, Naas General Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Limerick and Galway hospitals.<\/p><p> We have a growing and ageing population in this country and demand for our health and social care services is only going to go in one direction.  In the region of 1.3 million people attended our emergency departments last year and more than 330,000 people were admitted to hospitals from emergency departments during the same period.  This represents an increase on last year.  In particular, there was an increase in the number of older people, those aged 75 years or over.  The figure was up 11.3% last year on the year before.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding this rising demand, I wish to comment on something we do not often hear about, which is that some of our hospitals have done rather well.  The figures show that Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, Beaumont Hospital, Cavan General Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital, to name but a few, have seen a significant reduction in trolley numbers, ranging from 40% to 50%, compared to 2016.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation figures acknowledge that point.  We should acknowledge where good practice is in place and demand that it happens throughout the system.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that some hospitals experience specific challenges.  The hospitals in Galway and Limerick have capacity issues but they have embraced the national patient flow project and both hospitals have seen improvements in this regard.  I wish to thank staff and management in those hospitals.<\/p> <p> If we are really to progress this debate, we need to move on to the solutions.  What are we going to do to break the cycle?  We are going to pursue three key priorities.  We are going to increase bed capacity using the evidence and not the cries of those who want more beds for the hospitals in their constituencies.  We will use the beds evidence of the capacity review to work out where we need the beds, what type of beds we need and how we are going to get them there.  We are going to implement reform through Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are going to increase services provided through primary care by negotiating a new general practitioner contract and having engagements with GPs about how to unwind the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.<\/p> <p> The first point relates to capacity.  We simply do not have enough hospital beds in Ireland to serve our population.  That might sound like stating the obvious, but it was not obvious during 2007 to 2011, when policy decisions were made to reduce the number of hospital beds.  That was a policy of many people - it is not a partisan point.  There was a view that we could do much in primary care, a view held by many eminent people in the health service.  Clearly, there is a need to do more in primary care but we still need more beds in our acute hospital setting.<\/p> <p> I became Minister for Health at a time when our country was back in economic growth.  I want to build more hospitals, provide more beds and staff these beds.  I am committed to doing this using an evidence-based approach.  That is why we have undertaken a health system capacity review, aligning the needs of our health service now with our demographics out to 2031.  The review is now complete and will be brought to Cabinet next week.<\/p> <p> Additional capacity cannot be the only answer.  Reform must take place as well.  We need fundamental reform with significant development of primary and community care.  Sl&aacute;intecare provides a blueprint for this process.  I am committed to driving a genuine all-party approach to agreeing a vision for our health service.  That is what our country and people deserve.  One of the first things this Government did was work with Opposition politicians on the establishment of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and the production of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  There is considerable consensus in this regard and I am keen for Deputies to know that I am absolutely committed to delivering on those reforms.<\/p> <p> Detailed work will be overseen by a new Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  The recruitment process for an executive director has commenced and is under way.  The advertisement was placed on Friday.  It is about getting the right person.  That is why we did an executive search through the Public Appointments Service.  This will be the largest level of reform ever undertaken in the health service, if not in the public service.  It is essential that we get the right person with the right skills and experience.  I expect that process to be complete by April.<\/p> <p> We have already taken several actions with which Deputies will be familiar, including the preparation of legislation to introduce governing boards to bring back accountability and greater performance oversight.  We are looking at the consultation process on how to align hospital groups and community health organisations, taking on board the views of front-line staff and patients.  I have set up the Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir group, as the Sl&aacute;intecare report asked of me, to look at how we can decouple public and private health care.  Unlike the assertion of Deputy Adams, I want to see a universal health care system where private practice is decoupled from the public health service.<\/p> <p> I wish to briefly focus on primary care.  We will do Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are putting in more beds and we will continue to do this.  We know we need to work with our general practitioners to do more in primary care.  I know they are up for that and that they want to do that as well, but they need to be resourced.  That is why, within a week, I will set a date for the FEMPI talks to begin.  We can talk to our health contractors, staring with our GPs, about how to unwind some of the financial emergency measures brought in during times of economic recession to make their role more sustainable in future.  This will serve to enable the delivery of a new GP contract.  Much work has gone on.  Talks have been held with GP organisations and there have been negotiations with the IMO in the past year.  I believe the FEMPI talks will be an enabler to move those GP contract talks on further.<\/p> <p> Earlier, I heard the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il refer to the need to develop more community intervention teams.  He is correct in this regard and that is why we are doing it.  Budget 2018 provides further funding in this regard.  We have seen a significant increase in the number of referrals.  From January to the end of November, the figure was 34,452.  That figure already exceeded the expected activity for past year by more than 5%.  We need to do more in that regard as well.<\/p> <p> Putting more diagnostics in our primary care centres is under way.  This is not talk; we have done it.  I went to Castlebar, where we have put X-ray and ultrasound machines in the primary care centre.  This will ensure that we have more than fine buildings; we will have diagnostics as well.  More than 500 people were waiting for X-ray services in Mayo in April.  That figure is now down to zero.  Expanding the roll-out of diagnostics and access to diagnostics in primary care is clearly an important point.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that there are recruitment and especially retention issues.  We have a process that the unions are engaging in today under the Public Sector Pay Commission.  We have a specific module whereby the INMO, the IMO and my Department have made detailed submissions.  The commission will make a final report to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform this year.  I will certainly make my views clear in that regard.<\/p> <p> I wish to acknowledge the hard work done by our front-line staff and management during a very challenging period.  This year can and must be the year of reform in the health service.  I am committed to working with everyone in the House to make that reform a reality in order that we can build the health service that our citizens rightly demand and require, although we all know it will take several years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600048#VV00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516137900,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Murphy O'Mahony, Browne, Butler, Breathnach, Rabbitte, Murphy and Scanlon.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is timely in the sense that patients and staff in our emergency departments throughout the country have gone through horrific times in recent weeks.  Unfortunately, while we have heard talk about planning, I believe most of the planning was around spin rather than the actual implementation of substantial issues to address overcrowding in our emergency departments in the window after Christmas and the start of the new year.  Almost every year in recent years we have consistently seen bedlam and chaos in our emergency departments from the first Tuesday of the new year and flowing out through January and February.  It is beyond me.  I cannot understand why no system is in place other than the pretence of winter-proofing in September and October.  Press releases are turned out with claims of winter-proofing and that we are going to be ready for the winter flu and the challenges that are thrown at the health services in January.<\/p>  <p>  We know that if we do the same thing over and over again, we will get a consistent result.  That is a failure of management at the most senior levels in the HSE.  However, the Minister has to take some political responsibility for it.  He is in place in the Government.  It must take responsibility for the difficulties with regard to the lack of capacity not only in our emergency departments, but to the flow of patients through hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  There is no point in the Minister publishing a bed capacity review in the coming weeks if he does not immediately start assessing where he can identify in the short term wards in hospitals throughout the country that would be suitable for opening.  This should happen with minimal capital investment in the coming short period coupled with the increase in staff recruitment processes to man those beds.  There are longer term implications with regard to capital development of new hospital builds in the State over a longer period.  There is no point in us being here this time next year and saying that the bed capacity review has highlighted something that we intend to fund in the years ahead.  We need immediate efforts to pinpoint the pinch areas in our hospitals that cause overcrowding on a continual basis.  The crucial period is the time immediately after Christmas and in the early new year.  It is the same period year in, year out.  Today, I predict that if the Minister does nothing, as has been the case in recent years, we will again be here this time next year talking about bedlam and chaos in our hospitals throughout the country in 2019.  We will talk of patients waiting inordinate periods with poor health outcomes because of those delays.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to take on board the views expressed in the motion.  We understand the constraints the State has in terms of funding.  However, there can be quick wins in identifying closed wards or wards that have been converted in hospitals throughout the country.  We need to identify them early and we need capital investment to open them up.  Long-term bed capacity requirements will have to be addressed over a longer period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600049#WW00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1516138500,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Despite an undertaking by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in 2011 to bring an end to the trolley crisis, seven years later we find ourselves debating this issue in circumstances where the problem has become worse not better.

Our party spokesman on health issues, Deputy Kelleher, highlighted this to the Minister and the HSE last February when they were before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health but here we are again with no apparent plan.<\/p>  <p>  An adequate management system in emergency departments is impossible to maintain given that the recommended waiting times are constantly being overrun.  The latter results in emergency departments remaining at capacity levels all year round.  This is heightened at this time of the year thus making the situation worse.

I thank the staff working in our health system during this very difficult period.<\/p><p>In 2011, the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, vowed to bring an end to the trolley crisis.  However, seven years later and three Fine Gael Ministers of Health later, the problem is worse than ever, with record-breaking numbers of patients lying on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country.  What was once an unacceptable winter crisis of people languishing on trolleys is now a year-round experience in some hospitals.  Little did we realise that when Deputy Enda Kenny and Fine Gael promised to end the trolley crisis they meant they would do so by normalising it.  This has been a persistent problem but year after year the Government has failed to take the necessary steps to tackle the overcrowding crisis.  The Government is bereft of ideas and devoid of plans to address this crisis.  Instead, it is choosing to adopt the role of the innocent bystander looking aghast and with nodding concern but little understanding or acceptance that they are responsible for averting this crisis.  Almost 100,000 people spent time on trolleys in 2017.  There was at least one instance of a child sleeping overnight on a chair.  Last week, a couple told me that their adult daughter had to sleep on the floor of a ward without even a mattress.  Overcrowding results in more delays and cancellations to scheduled hospital treatments and between 350 and 400 deaths every year result from overcrowding.  The persistent problem must be tackled once and for all.  It has been clear for a long time that there are insufficient beds in the system.  It is not just a question of bed capacity in hospitals.  We need greater availability of nursing home beds, rehabilitation spaces, convalescent supports and home care supports so that those fit for discharge can be discharged with the supports they need.  The lack of availability of out-of-hour diagnostics in hospitals or the availability of diagnostics to GPs is still not being addressed.  Implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the all-party agreed plan for the future of our health care service, has been dragging.  There is still no sign of electronic health records and mental health services are failing.  An international assessment of our mental health services, as reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today, makes for depressing reading.  It is time for this Government to stop playing the innocent bystander and to start taking responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600050#XX00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1516138500,"counter":505,"content":"<p>As the Minister is aware, we have an ageing population.  We are living longer, healthier lives which is very welcome.  However when the older generation require hospitalisation they are anxious, nervous, frightened, bewildered and mostly in pain.  The health service is overstretched.  The emergency department, the part of our acute system that never says no, is the place where patients come up against access block and are unable to access an acute hospital bed.<\/p>  <p>  I want to refer to the son and daughter of a 75 year old man who was admitted to the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Waterford on 1 December 2017.  They articulate what we all know is happening all over the country.  The trolley figures confirm this and I welcome this motion from Sinn F&eacute;in to briefly address this issue.  The man's children said their main concerns relate to the clear overstretching of resources within the emergency department.  They witnessed not only their father but many vulnerable patients on trolleys in corridors where the lights were on 24 hours a day seven days a week.  Accordingly, sleeping was not an option and neither was a call for assistance.  They witnessed patients needing to assist each other at times with only one accessible toilet for many to use.  Alternatively, people were obliged to leave the unit out of view of the health care professionals.  This was not an environment which promoted patient safety, dignity, privacy or confidentiality.  Their father was unable to sleep.  Placed at the end of the corridor he was frequently asked to push a door release button through a busy area as needed or staff had to lean over him to do this.  The attention given by the nursing and medical staff was impeccable despite these difficult circumstances but to have vulnerable people on trolleys at 75 years of age in an open, unsafe area for three nights is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The reason this family went public was that they wanted to point out that the staff were fantastic but the circumstances in which they were working were very challenging.  Unfortunately this gentleman died on 17 December and the family said that while they were more than aware that the outcome would most likely have been the same the initial period in the emergency department delayed active palliative treatment and allowed additional suffering that was not necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The persistent problems in emergency departments must be tackled once and for all.  It is simply unacceptable that the trolley crisis remains.  The blockages will have to be removed.  I was very interested to hear Mr. Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland state during the Christmas period that there were approximately 1,400 beds available in nursing homes.

I commenced in local politics in 1991 and became intimately involved in the old health boards.  The changing of their name to HSE in 2004 has done little to recognise the demographic growth of our population.  I have no doubt that services and outcomes for those who get into the health system have dramatically improved and should be acknowledged by me and all Members of this House.  I compliment the various members of the staff of the health service on their great work.<\/p>  <p>  In my lifetime of involvement with health boards, waiting lists have continued to grow and every service under successive governments has been trying to put a gallon into a pint cup.  The health services are running to a standstill despite that huge growth in population, particularly in the past 30 years.  The Taoiseach stated earlier today that if it was just a matter of funding, this issue would have been resolved by now because there has been an increase of over 20% in funding.  Ireland has one of the highest levels of expenditure on health services of all OECD countries but it also has one of the poorest outcomes.  The trolley figures, which Deputy Adams mentioned, were 29 today in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and were at an all-time high of 607 for the month of November.  The latter was despite the fact that, as the Minister indicated, a 60-bed unit has been opened at the hospital.  We expect the bed capacity review next week to say that 2,500 extra beds are required.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should dust down the proposals on the regional hospital for the north east in that respect.

There is a serious need for the Minister to look into an incremental increase for those who stay for a given duration in the medical profession.  That increment could be rewarded on an initial basis with an additional increment the longer one stays in the system.  It is clear to me that we have a major issue.  I do not want to go over all the other issues that have been raised in respect of better community services and all the rest of it.

Those waiting on the trolleys are sick people who need to be in hospital.  One reason they are on trolleys is there are no hospital inpatient beds available to them.  All acute hospital beds need to be reopened immediately and appropriately staffed and resourced.  Health care professionals in emergency departments and acute hospitals nationwide have been telling us this for years, as has the annual crisis.  I disagree with the Minister.  I do not think we need a bed capacity review to tell us what is already obvious.  What we need is more hospital beds.<\/p>  <p>  Health care is a continuum.  The overcrowding and backlog we are seeing in the emergency departments at present are the result of problems throughout the entirety of the health care system, which are made visible when the system is at crisis point.  The flow of patients from emergency departments through the hospitals and safely home again needs to be facilitated.  We need not only more beds but also more rehabilitation and support services for patients in hospital, in the transition period from hospital back to their homes, and into the community.  We need more nursing and medical staff, undoubtedly.  However, we also need more health care professionals, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, social care workers, dieticians and psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  Adequate home care packages need to be provided if people are to return home from hospital and recover fully.  Placing people on a waiting list for home care packages and discharging them without any support while they wait for this service is totally unacceptable.  Galway is a very good example if the Minister wants to check this.  We should also consider working with the non-profit organisations.  The Parkinson's Association of Ireland's branch in Galway caters for over 700 members.  Unfortunately, before Christmas, funding fell short and three of its members had to attend an accident and emergency department.  Prior to that, in its five years of existence it has never had to use an accident and emergency department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600051#YY00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1516139100,"counter":509,"content":"<p>As my time is limited, I will have to omit some of the material I was going to use this evening.

As Deputy Rabbitte and more of my party colleagues and the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputes have said, we need to reopen those beds.  In this House earlier today, the Taoiseach said 2,500 beds would be added by 2031.  That is 13 years.  We will have an older population.  Furthermore, I see that a number of services that were being provided in various towns and counties are being closed down.  The beds are not being used.  These include services for people with Alzheimer's, dementia, and some mental health issues.  I am aware of a service in Castlerea, which I will bring up with the Minister another day.  I know he is aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Minister one or two very brief examples as I am sharing time with Deputy Scanlon.  A 90 year-old woman was left on a trolley at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe for seven hours recently.  She was brought in for a minor X-ray.  She was moved to the accident and emergency department and left on the trolley there for seven hours.  At that stage it was decided they were going to do nothing with the lady there and they gave her an appointment for Merlin Park the next day.  When she went to Merlin Park, it was something very minor and she is now home and well.  During that period, however, her blood pressure rose and other problems arose.  Luckily, one family member was able to come in and help settle her down.  That should not be happening.  Why was that lady left in the accident and emergency department for seven hours after coming in for a minor X-ray?<\/p>  <p>  The staff members in all those hospitals are working hard and are trying to look after people.  We all want to make that clear.  The staff members are doing their best.  I have another constituent who is desperately ill and cannot get a bed in Tallaght.  He is in Sligo hospital at the moment.  That man is very ill.  His family and his doctors are very worried about him.  I urge the Minister to look up that case as well and see if he can help that man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600051#YY00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1516139100,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I have very little time but I want to comment on what I feel is a serious problem at the moment.

Unfortunately, those beds are needed next week.  That is what it is going to take to resolve the problem, from what I can gather.  There is another way.  While we need the extra beds, a decent home care package should also be put into place.  That needs to be considered seriously.  We have people in nursing homes under the fair deal scheme and the beds are costing from &euro;900 to &euro;1,100 a week.  If there was a decent home care package such that people could buy in the care that they require to keep people in their own homes where they want to be, it would be a massive improvement in trying to resolve some of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  Because of all this overcrowding, there are many people waiting for operations at the moment.  They are waiting to get into hospital.  I am referring to people who might be suffering from cancer or other serious issues, or who might not even know yet whether they are.

I agree with every single thing that has been said here tonight.  I think we all do.  There is political consensus that we have a crisis.  I am not going to bother with the tit for tat political rubbish.  We are in a crisis situation when it comes to health care.  The problem now for us all is that it is like talking about the weather.  Solutions do not arrive when there is a discourse that emanates and passes through people as a matter of form and norm.  In the middle of all this, we have incredible people working in the service.  We all acknowledge that.  They are the best people one could ever meet.  Like everyone else in this House, I have had to deal with them.  All the stories we have told about people waiting and, of course, when people are in desperate straits they come to the likes of us and we try to help out.  Incidentally, that should not be the way it works.  I have had to do it myself on numerous occasions over the holiday period.  It is at the stage now where, as politicians representing all the various views, we need to come together and pull together instead of pulling apart.  We know what our strengths are: our resources and our people.  We have significant decisions to make in the short, medium and long term.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Minister to support the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I welcome what he has done in respect of advertising the position at the head of it.  I know he has commenced some of the reviews that were requested.  The issue of private practice by consultants in public hospitals is something I was determined about as one of those who helped draft the report.  I welcome all of that.  That is long term.  However, we are behind schedule already.  <\/p>  <p>  What are we going to do in the short to medium term?  While the bed capacity review is critically important, I agree with Deputy Kelleher that it is one thing doing a report.  How are we going to ensure that the stock arrives and quickly?<\/p><p>I do not expect the Minister to wave a magic wand.  It is impossible to wave a magic wand and have the beds appear.  We need to identify where, in the short term, we can make beds available in hospitals throughout the country where there are wards and capacity.  In the medium term, we obviously need a capital plan.  I believe that everyone in the House will support the Minister in respect of the capital review and getting as much money as possible to deliver that. <\/p> <p> Some 96 beds have been promised in a new unit in University Hospital Limerick.  Limerick is on one side of me and south Tipperary is on the other.  The two hospitals with the biggest accident and emergency department issues in the country are located in the area.  It will be four or five years before the new unit is in place.  What will people do in the interim?  We need to be innovative and find solutions.  <\/p> <p> Everyone has spoken about demographic changes, people having greater expectations and all of that.  Of course people have higher expectations because they are living longer and there are treatments now for many things which we could not treat ten or 15 years ago.  Has it come to a stage in this country where in the case of a very simple issue, such as a double cataract, people are told they are lucky to get one eye done?  That is the state we are in in Ireland in 2018.  People are being told that they are lucky to have one eye treated, and not to be selfish and look for treatment in the other eye in case they could drive a car or go to work.  It is incredible.<\/p> <p> We need to change the way pathways are working across the hospital network and hospital groups.  I wish to make one recommendation which could improve the situation in the short-term.  Our ambulance service is under major pressure.  I have raised this issue for years, as the Ministers knows, but I will repeat myself.  There is no reason that intermediate vehicles cannot operate across hospital networks and transport people from grade A to grade B hospitals in order for them to be treated in step-down facilities or avail of aftercare treatment or monitoring.  There are people in University Hospital Limerick rather than Ennis or Nenagh because there is no transport to move them.  Sometimes vehicles are not available or do not operate.  The same happens across the country.  This is a low-cost solution and all of these things would help.  People can be brought to Ennis and Nenagh, where there is capacity and wards could be extended or opened.  <\/p> <p> We all know what happened with regard to the Hanly report and other reports, whereby services were closed without adequate services being available in other hospitals.  Let us not go down that road with Portlaoise.  We also have to ensure that the pathways between hospitals outside networks are improved.  <\/p> <p> Last week, I heard about a young 12 year old boy who has liver failure.  He was brought by his parents to University Hospital Limerick, and was then referred to a hospital in Dublin.  Everything was supposed to be fine and a bed was supposed to be available for him in the hospital.  However, when he arrived yesterday, it was not available and the family were told to come back at lunchtime and again in the evening.  The bed was still not available and last night the family slept in a hotel.  They went back to the hospital today and the bed was still not available.  The family spent the day at a service station, with their sleeping child on the back seat of a car.  He was sick and jaundiced.  They waited for hours at the service station, hoping and praying that they did not have to drive to Limerick to get drugs for the child.  They cried to me on the phone, looking for help to get into a hospital in Dublin.  Luckily, after a lot of phone calls, the child got a bed in hospital tonight.  The child was in the back seat of the car with his twin - they go everywhere together.  That type of thing is not the practice we need in 2018 and is not an example of the pathways which work in this country.  The pathways do not work.  Children, of all people, should not be affected.<\/p> <p> I have said to the Minister on numerous occasions that we have to develop more home help hours and home care packages.  The simple fact of the matter is that it makes financial sense.  Home care packages and home help hours keep people in their homes.  It is cheaper and more cost effective than nursing homes or spending &euro;6,000 to keep a patient in an acute bad.  This is not rocket science; we just need to roll out such a policy as quickly as possible.  There is an issue in terms of getting staff.<\/p> <p> I wish to recommend long-term, medium-term and short-term solutions, because we have to come up with solutions.  In the long term, we need a significant amount of investment on the capital side in IT because that will save money.  In the medium term, the roll-out of home care packages needs to be enhanced and quadrupled.  In the short term, I ask the Minister to examine transportation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600051#YY00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516139700,"counter":513,"content":"<p>When the unacceptable becomes acceptable we have a major problem not only in our health service, but in society.  I know the Minister said over the Christmas period that the trolley crisis is unacceptable - he said the same last year.  It is somewhat Orwellian to say it is unacceptable but it is acceptable.  It is similar to the housing crisis, whereby the Taoiseach said it was normal.  It is abnormal to have 8,000 people in emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past decade, previous Ministers for Health have described the perennial health crisis as the trolley crisis.  People want to know why this happening.  There is a reason that everything happens.  Due to the fact that we are politicians, there is a political reason that there is a trolley crisis in our health service.  That political reason is a political choice on the part of Fine Gael over the past six years and by Fianna F&aacute;il in previous years.  Politically and ideologically, thousands of beds were taken out of the health service.  As a result, we now have a health crisis. <\/p>  <p>  I have worked in the health system alongside some amazing and fantastic people.  However, the demoralisation of health service staff is pretty bad.  Front-line staff are demoralised by the ongoing crisis.  It is a plague on the houses of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael that the crisis is ongoing.  The debate earlier today was nauseating.  The Taoiseach sparred with Deputy Martin about which beds were taken out of the system in the decade during which Deputy Martin was a Minister.  Nobody really wants to know that, rather people want to know that their mothers, fathers or brothers are not left on trolleys.  People do not forget that.  Seeing one's mother suffer stays in one's mind forever.  I know the Minister does not want to see that, but this is the system that has been created as a result of ideology.  There is an answer to every question.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, not one person should be on a trolley, never mind 600.  We have a system that the Minister believes in and perhaps he is coming around to Sl&aacute;intecare and so forth, which is fine, but we have a two-tier health system.  Once there is such a system, there will be a perennial crisis such as this.  It is not acceptable and normal for anybody to be on a trolley in 2018.  If it becomes normal, we can all walk out of this place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1516139700,"counter":514,"content":"<p>We have seen chaos in accident and emergency departments.  The trolleys have been jammed together.  The patients are toe-to-toe.<\/p><p>The scandal of closed public wards has already been mentioned but no Deputy has yet mentioned that there were cases of other empty beds during this crisis too, sometimes just hundreds of metres away from the chaos in the accident and emergency departments.  I am talking about the empty beds in private hospitals and in private wards.  What a scandal that this is so when public patients suffer.<br\/><br\/>When Cork University Hospital, CUH, purchased ten private beds at the Mater Private Hospital in Mahon on 7 January it made national headlines.  There were ten beds to buy and the same was done elsewhere.  One could ask how many beds lay idle during the crisis over the past fortnight.  We do not know because the private hospitals are under no obligation to release the information.  However, we have anecdotal information.  In an interesting article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, Fergus Finlay described how a majority of the beds in a private ward in which he spent time recently were empty.<br\/><br\/>We must reverse the austerity health cuts of recent times.  That means thousands of new beds in public hospitals, but we also need a planned, rational use of resources to meet the challenges of public health care, including emergencies.  It also means putting all of the country's health resources at the disposal of society, which in turn means nationalisation of the private hospitals and of those private beds.  We must fight for every bed.<br\/><br\/>At Bandon Community Hospital, County Cork, there are currently 13 beds not in use because of a dispute over staffing levels.  If the HSE were to simply hire one extra nurse and two extra health care assistants, those beds could be brought into play more or less immediately.  The three extra staff should be hired immediately.<br\/><br\/>At Cobh Community Hospital, County Cork, 44 beds are currently in jeopardy because of the hospital's financial viability under a section 39 model.  If the hospital is upgraded to a HSE hospital then the beds would be guaranteed, but the HSE will not do that as it would mean increasing pay rates.  It is ludicrous to put 44 beds in jeopardy for that reason.  The hospital should be made into a HSE hospital, the wages should be increased and those vital 44 beds should be saved.<br\/><br\/>The European Commission says there will be a global shortfall of 1 million health care workers by 2020 and that 600,000 of them will be nurses and midwives.  Nurses and midwives are part of a globalised labour market and the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, recently found that 92% of student nurses and midwives were considering emigration, largely for reasons relating to pay.  Last year, according to the INMO, 1,400 of 2,000 nurses and midwives who left the HSE did so because they resigned.  Many went to Britain, Australia or Canada while others went to the private sector where pay is higher to the tune of thousands of extra euro per annum.  It is clear that we will continue to have a crisis in terms of the retention of nursing staff until such time as they are granted very significant pay rises.<br\/><br\/>As a Solidarity Deputy, I consider myself a workers' representative in Parliament and have made a point during this crisis to talk to hospital workers and listen to their point of view.  In Cork I have listened to stories of wards crammed full of potential flu victims with just three or four thermometers at hand for the entire ward.  I have heard stories of Dinamap monitors so frayed and worn that attempts to take accurate blood pressure readings were hampered.  I have spoken to ambulance staff who have completed 14-hour shifts without time to break for a proper meal.  In general, I have heard stories of front-line workers under pressure from a crisis but then put under even greater pressure by a shortage of resources, including human resources.<br\/><br\/>I believe this crisis has made the case more clearly than words could ever do for an Irish national health service unshackled by cuts and privatisation.  For sure there is a crisis in the NHS in the UK but that must be addressed by going forward to the original principles of its founders, not by going back to the public-private model which we have here.  In conclusion, I urge the Minister to reverse the bed cuts, pay the nurses and health staff a living wage, invest in primary care and establish an Irish national health service unshackled by cuts or privatisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516140300,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice.

I have no hesitation in supporting it.  I also thank the Minister for confirming that he is not opposing the motion.  In addition, I congratulate the Taoiseach today for his announcement that there will be an increase in bed capacity.  That is certainly a change because up to now successive Governments have confirmed that we needed fewer beds, which I never accepted.<\/p>  <p>  The accident and emergency crisis and the trolley crisis are simply a symptom of a health system that is under enormous pressure.  That is the case due to a sustained policy of reducing resources.  I was a proud member of the health forum for ten years.  Back in 2006, before the financial and banking crisis, we had closed wards and closed beds in the regional hospital in Galway.  Different language was used at the time such as \"cost-containment measures\" and \"bed refurbishment\" which was a new one on me.  The crisis has been deliberately created by successive Governments, which opted for private medicine.  They did that in a very blunt way through various initiatives.  They systematically ran down the public system, leaving beds and wards closed.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, before Christmas we discovered that a brand new ward, St. Finbar's, was closed in a centre of excellence in Galway.  I hope that came as a surprise to the Minister.  It came as a surprise to me.  One of the initiatives in response to two theatres closing in Merlin Park due to water ingress was to open up the closed St. Finbar's ward.  I did not hear the Minister or any Government politician express shock or ask the management why the ward was closed in the first place in the centre of excellence.<\/p>  <p>  We have had various initiatives that actively promoted the private health system.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund was introduced as a temporary measure but it has become a long-term measure.  The special delivery unit was a temporary measure and as a consequence of that money is going into the private system.  The then Minister, Mary Harney, declared an emergency at a time when there were just 495 patients on trolleys.  While she was declaring that emergency she was simultaneously actively promoting co-location of private hospitals on public lands.  The trolley crisis did not happen yesterday.  It has happened over a period of years as a result of the policies of various Governments which believed that private medicine is better than public medicine and one way or another have actively supported that system.<\/p>  <p>  If we come back to Galway city there is a congested site and very bad decisions have been made that have added to that.  The Minister knows the answer is to start planning for a new hospital in Merlin Park where we have 150 acres of land.  In New York Central Park has 800 acres for a population of approximately 12 million.  We have a population of 80,000 and we have one park with 150 acres yet we cannot see fit to build a hospital there.  We have allowed bad decision after bad decision to add to a congested site in Galway.  As a result of that the helicopter service moved and took over a public park for three to six months.  Can one imagine that?  Over three years later it is still in the public park.<\/p>  <p>  Wards are closed and in addition there is a complete absence of primary care facilities.  There is no primary care facility on the west side of the city in Galway and we have no mental health primary care facilities whatsoever.  We have an ambulance service working from containers in Merlin Park.  There was a recent scandal involving a child on a visit to Connemara who almost died while waiting for an ambulance that did not arrive for more than an hour.  I could mention many other decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The only thing that disappoints me about the Minister tonight is that he talked about giving a counter-narrative.  There is no need for that.  We know that nurses and doctors are doing their best on the ground.  What we want are solutions and a recognition that the health service is sick.  It is sick not because of the staff on the ground but because of what I have outlined, a sustained plan to undo it.<\/p><p>As a result of that plan, mistake after mistake has been made.  Unfortunately, I know this, professionally and personally, as a result of my family's experience.  The cost of reviews, tribunals and independent case reviews is a matter I will raise again with the Minister in the future.<\/p> <p> Let me return to the numbers on trolleys.  Galway has the highest number today, that is, 38 out of the 541 people on trolleys.  When the emergency was declared by the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, in 2006, there were, as already stated, 495 people on trolleys.  On 3 January this year, 677 were on trolleys.  Two years ago, the Government negotiated with the Independents in respect of a heartbeat in Waterford being more important than a heartbeat in Galway or any other part of this country rather than having them make a commitment based on what we all knew at that point, namely, that the health service is not fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600053#AAA00400","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516140900,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I support the motion and commend Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly on introducing it.<\/p>  <p>  I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for approximately three years and this is about the 30th debate on health during that time.

We are three-quarters of the way through that period and circumstances are getting worse.  There are people waiting for appointments, amounting to 670,000 or 680,000.  Circumstances are getting worse despite the best will in the world.<\/p>  <p>  I saw the Minister on the television during the Christmas period offering an apology.  The Taoiseach also made statements.  Apologising will not cure someone waiting on a hospital trolley for a few days, nor will it help the front-line staff who are trying to fight a fire day in, day out because the necessary infrastructure and system have not been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The GP contract has to be tidied up.  This matter has gone on for so long.  The Department is weaving in and out.  I spoke to a doctor some days ago who explained very clearly the fact that he cannot pay staff to be going around the country and that this is why patients are sent into hospitals.  One has to understand that position because the Department is trying to get away with murder.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for Government, there is a reference to an air ambulance but the Minister has not even carried out the review yet.<\/p>  <p>  As the previous speaker pointed out, the infrastructure in Galway is inadequate .  Two years ago, the Taoiseach admitted that Galway hospital, as a centre of excellence, is not fit for purpose.  There are 150 acres of land available nearby.  I attended a meeting a few months before Christmas at which the problems at Merlin Park were discussed.  What is being done?  Nothing.  I am not blaming the Minister because there are people with responsibilities in the HSE who do not man up and take the decisions.  They will not do the work that has to be done.<\/p>  <p>  We also need help from unions.  We need the machinery in place to ensure that primary care centres cater for more people.  If one compares the hours of work of X-ray machines in private hospitals by comparison with public hospitals, one will note there is a totally different ball game.<\/p>  <p>  It is worrying when one hears consultants saying that they have to decide who is the worst case in an intensive care unit, ICU.  I accept that the Minister does not a magic bullet to use.  Unless a genuine effort is made, however, this matter will not be addressed.  Unless the people in the Department making the decisions - and not only the Minister - step up to the mark, the problem will never be solved.

The main issue in trying to solve the problem in our health service is trying to achieve political drive and buy-in.  It is a huge problem and nobody underestimates the challenge to be faced in solving the problems in our health service.  It is a considerable challenge but the Government must start to address it.<\/p>  <p>  We have produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report and have spoken about it many times at meetings of the health committee.  The report contains the answers to our problems.  Rather than haranguing the Minister, I wish to propose two solutions that could resolve the problem in a speedy manner.  The first is to introduce elective-only hospitals.  We have spoken about them at meetings of the health committee and we have spoken about how they work in Scotland.  Building elective-only hospitals is a crucial solution to the health service crisis because it means people will be guaranteed planned procedures.  They will have their procedures carried out and will not be competing against people from casualty and those requiring urgent care for beds.  Building elective-only hospitals would streamline services.  The hospitals would be attractive places to work.  One would be able to attract staff, including nurses.  The hospitals could be iconic features of the Irish health service.<\/p>  <p>  The second point is that our model-two hospitals are being under-utilised.  All the resources are being poured into our model-four hospitals.  Our model-two hospitals could be diagnostic hubs.  Unused theatre space in our model 2 hospitals is not being used.  Outpatient departments in our model 2 hospitals are not being utilised fully.  Certainly, they could be used as diagnostic centres.  When the Minister is considering his reform programme, I ask him to concentrate on model 2 hospitals and maximise their capacity.  He should also introduce elective-only hospitals.  A hospital bed costs approximately &euro;1 million.  If we built three 100-bed elective-only hospitals, it would make a serious indent in our waiting lists.  Waiting lists are the biggest problem facing the health service.  The Minister should concentrate on those two issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600054#BBB00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1516140900,"counter":522,"content":"<p>The Minister said last week that it might be a good idea to build more hospitals.

Why?  Dingle Community Hospital is only half open.  The land for that hospital was given free of charge.  Why is it not fully open?  These are the questions the Minister needs to ask the HSE.  Some of the rooms in Dingle hospital have offices where beds should be.<\/p>  <p>  Why can we not pay more doctors, surgeons, nurses and staff in times of need to work through the night and over the weekends to clear the backlog?  We are sending buses to Belfast in the North so patients can have cataract procedures.  A second bus went up last week.  Another is to go next week.  Thirteen patients had procedures last Sunday.  The patients, from Cork and Kerry, had to go from one end of the country to the other for a simple procedure.  The staff involved are working over weekends and through the night.

As my brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, highlighted, Kenmare Community Hospital, one of the finest hospitals in all of Ireland, is completely underutilised.  Instead of using Dingle Community Hospital for beds, which is what it was meant to be used for, offices were put into it.  It is disgraceful.

By virtue of its definition, a crisis is something that cannot be predicted, yet nothing is more predictable than the annual wringing of hands while people at their most vulnerable face horrific conditions in our hospitals.  It is not a crisis.  It is as certain as a rainy day in January.  We must stop describing it as a crisis.  Instead, it must be seen as a symptom of the failure to properly build a functioning health system.<\/p>  <p>  Today's trolley watch informed us that there are 5,041 people on hospital trolleys, lined up beside each other, positioned in corridors, doorways, cupboard spaces, kitchen facilities, etc.  That is just not on.  These are already stressed patients at their most vulnerable who are very often in places where they cannot get to sleep due to noise and interruptions.

When one brings it back down to the personal, which Caitriona O'Neill and William Gallagher did in describing what happened to their father, it makes it real, tangible and urgent.  We all have seen it in our families, even if in different circumstances.  The fact that Catriona and William have real medical expertise in cancer and nursing care gives them real authority when they say it is not acceptable or right that a 75 year old man had to spend three days on a hospital trolley when he required palliative care and certain basic procedures but was unable to get them in that time.  It is something by which we are all shamed and it should end.<\/p>  <p>  It is about the provision of physical infrastructure and beds.

We have to promote and advance investment in ehealth to ensure we get the best use of our resources.  The lack of measurements and understanding is a problem.  I have been told the HSE still operates in a fax-and-letter world.  To ensure we use resources well, we have to embrace digital technologies, as well as the sharing and use of digital information, to be efficient in what we do.  We need to do everything differently.  We need multi-annual budgets, not annual budgets where there is a fight and tussle with finance.  We need new commissioning groups to ensure the move towards primary and preventive care, which we all agree is the cornerstone of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This will mean it is not just hospitals running the entire system, but that there is oversight of how we allocate resources across the system to make it work.

It is well worth supporting and we certainly hope that will be supported in the capital programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600055#CCC00500","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516142100,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla r&aacute;iteas a thabhairt don Aire mar gheall ar an mh&eacute;id at&aacute; ag titim amach i gContae na M&iacute;.  I have been given a couple of statements recently relating to the difficulties with the trolley count in Navan.  I hear that people are stuck in the waiting room of the emergency department in Navan without getting access to the hospital itself.  They are being forced to wait for long periods in that waiting room after having been triaged and treated.  They are forced to wait with needles left in their arms, while waiting for X-rays and for blood tests.  Those people are forced to wait on their feet because there are no seats left in the waiting rooms for people trying to get into the hospitals.  I heard a report about Drogheda to the effect that it was like a cattle market at the time.  One man was obliged to sit in the waiting room for five hours after being triaged.  The report stated that the waiting room was full to the brim, that three ambulances had just arrived and they were being forced to wait because they could not leave their patients behind unattended.  Dr. Tom Ryan, president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, said that the HSE is rationing intensive care unit, ICU, beds.  That means that staff members are forced to prioritise patients in serious need over other patients.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine stated, on the trolley crisis and waiting list, that up to 350 people will die in Ireland in 2018 because of those two factors.<\/p>  <p>  The trolley count in Navan has quadrupled in the space of one year from 500 people to 2,500.  One should put those three sentences together and then consider that it is the objective of the Government and of the HSE to close the ICU and emergency department beds in Navan.  I only have a couple of seconds left so I will make a point on the issue of there being no step-down facilities in County Meath whatsoever.  Some years ago, I found that a person was forced to wait for 24 months after being clinically discharged from Navan.  That person was left in a hospital bed for two years after the doctors said they could not help that person any more because of blocked pathways.  I found out in the last months that another person was forced to spend one year on a trolley after being clinically discharged.  We had 24 people in hospital beds in our hospital this year who were clinically discharged.  That is an entire wardful.  We need step-down facilities in Meath to alleviate this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600056#DDD00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1516142100,"counter":531,"content":"<p>The figures are stark.  Some 98,981 patients spent one night or more on a trolley last year.  In Portlaoise alone, 3,203 people spent one night or more on a trolley.  On Monday night of this week, 15 people were on trolleys in Portlaoise.  There is a plan before the Minister to close Portlaoise emergency department, forcing patients to go to Tullamore, where there were 35 patients on trolleys on Monday, or to Tallaght, where there were a further ten, and that was one of the best recent days in Tallaght.  Any proposal to close Portlaoise hospital and push people to other overcrowded hospitals will not work and these figures show it.  The Taoiseach committed today, and I hope I heard him correctly, that no emergency department would be closed.  I hope he adheres to that and I welcome that if that is the case.  The people of Laois, Offaly and south Kildare who depend on Portlaoise hospital deserve better and the people of the State deserve better.  Action is needed in four specific areas.  We can all see what the problems are and we have to say what the solutions are.  Sinn F&eacute;in is constantly putting forward costed solutions.  There are 162 fewer hospital beds now than there were in 2008, yet the population of the State has increased dramatically.<\/p>  <p>  We propose to immediately increase the number of beds by 500 at a cost of &euro;153 million.  That is in our alternative budget.  There is a shortage of general practitioners, GPs, in the country, with a huge shortage in Laois.  Sinn F&eacute;in would focus our health service more on primary care, catching people before they have to go to hospital and providing care in the community.  We provide for the recruitment of 200 extra GPs in our budget.  We would recruit 500 additional nurses each year over the next five years, and 800 consultants over a five-year period.  We know it will take time and that we cannot do it in one or two years.  We would also increase home care packages.  I will say a quick word on this issue.  We want to increase home help hours by 20% and we budgeted for that.  It is in our costed proposals.  We put forward those solutions in those four areas.  Step-down facilities need to be utilised, such as at Abbeyleix hospital in my own constituency.  The Minister is aware of this.  We are meeting the committee for Abbeyleix hospital on Thursday night about this.  As elderly patients in Portlaoise hospital could be discharged to that facility, Abbeyleix now needs to be expanded and upgraded.<\/p>  <p>  My final words are on home help schemes.  I had a case in my office this morning where a woman was granted one hour, seven mornings a week, to keep her in her home in a rural area on the side of the Slieve Bloom mountains.  If that woman does not get that help, she will be in hospital.  She was granted it in May and still has not received it.  She has been put on a waiting list.  Employ some of the unemployed people on the dole for home help and let us keep people in their local areas and local communities.  It would cost approximately &euro;100 a week.  To put people in a home would cost &euro;1,000 a week.  Those are the economics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600056#DDD00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1516142100,"counter":532,"content":"<p>My constituency holds a shameful record as the location of the most overcrowded hospital in the State in 2017.  University Hospital Limerick saw 8,869 people lying on trolleys last year.  That is an absolute disgrace.  University Hospital Limerick has been suffering from severe overcrowding for years.  The situation is not just being caused by the flu outbreak.  It has become a permanent feature in Limerick.  The Government is doing nothing to help the patients in my constituency.  The core of these problems stems from the downgrading of Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals and the establishment of the so-called centre of excellence in University Hospital Limerick, which has not worked.  In May, I expressed my concern that the opening of the emergency department would see the overcrowding levels transfer to a new part of the hospital.  Unfortunately, this has come to pass.  I raised a topical issue at the time with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I told him that the nurses on the ground were concerned that there was a plan to have 24 patients accommodated on trolleys and chairs from the get-go in the new emergency department.  The Minister of State completely rebuffed this and rubbished my claims, dismissing any such suggestion, suggesting that there was no basis for the idea that 24 patients would be accommodated on trolleys in the new emergency department.  This was wholly untrue.  More than 24 patients are accommodated on trolleys and chairs in the new emergency department every single day.  It is often double that number.  It is a shocking situation.  It is ongoing, shameful, and exposes a health service in crisis.  I asked the Minister to intervene in the summer.  Instead, he wrote an email to the manager of the hospital, outlining his unhappiness.  That does not solve the problems.  We do not need studies, reviews or investigations.  We need extra money and extra beds to accommodate the patients.  It is that simple.  I hope the Minister is listening and that his Cabinet colleagues will reflect on this the next time they sit down and see how much tax they give away.  They should think about the &euro;335 million they gave away in October's budget and how that would help to address the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600056#DDD00400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1516142100,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Today, 29 people of all ages who were in need of medical assistance were left lying in the corridors of the emergency department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  Staff in the emergency department had to run the equivalent of an inpatient ward in the corridors of the emergency department, on top of all the patients presenting to the emergency department 24-7.  Staff also had to endure this on top of staff shortages.  Every single winter, the Government feigns shock and promises to tackle the situation, states it will not happen again, that it will do better the next year and how this year was the worst year, as well as stating that it intends to improve next year.  Why does the Government do that?  I will give the history of why it happens repeatedly in County Louth.<\/p><p>In 2010, the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government closed 97 acute beds in Louth County Hospital.  It would not listen to public concern and warnings that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda would not be able to cope and there would be overcrowding.  That Government bulldozed ahead and closed the beds.  Only 40 beds were opened in Drogheda to compensate for this.  I acknowledge that additional beds were provided there recently.  However, that only gets us back to the position we were in 2010.  Despite that, in 2012, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government again targeted public provision of beds in County Louth.  They removed the long stay and respite beds in the college hospital in Drogheda and ignored massive public opposition to that move.  A total of 10,000 people took to the streets of Drogheda to protest about it and the Government was told that it would compound matters.  To this day, elderly who are medically fit cannot be discharged from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital because no home help, respite care and home care packages and housing adaptation grants are available.  One problem has compounded another.  To add insult to injury, we were promised a 100-bed unit in St. Mary's, Drogheda after the hospital was closed.  Six years later, not one brick has been laid.  The Government should not feign shock every year at the trolley numbers.  They are the result of policy and until that policy changes, nothing will improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600056#DDD00500","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516142700,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I am sorry the Minister had to leave but he has asked me to make the closing contribution.  I thank Members for their contributions, some of which I listened to before I arrived in the Chamber.  The Minister and I have taken notes.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the debate that the House shares our commitment and determination, and that of the Government, to do better for our patients.  Despite the genuine efforts of politicians, health service managers and front-line staff, our emergency departments are under pressure this January.  What we are seeing in our hospitals right across the country is a symptom of long-standing and fundamental deficits within our broader health system.  I have listened carefully to the debate and I believe we need to move forward now and implement the three key priorities of Government: implement the findings of the health system capacity review; progress the reforms set out in Sl&aacute;intecare; and make a decisive shift to primary care.<\/p>  <p>  While improving hospital services is essential, we cannot underestimate the importance of moving away from a hospital-centric model of care.  We need to recognise the interrelated, interdependent nature of the environment within which public hospitals operate. As the Minister pointed out, the Government is committed to delivering more non-acute care within the primary care sector.  This means that better care which is close to home can be provided for communities around the country.  To this end, we have invested significantly in our primary care infrastructure providing modern well-equipped primary care centres.  This will allow our primary care teams and GPs to be located together and will enable the delivery of a wider a range of integrated primary care services.  Currently, 110 centres operational with a further 18 expected to become operational throughout 2018.  There will be a continued focus on advancing those 60 locations which are under construction or at various planning stages.  Significant investment in additional staffing and service reorientation has also been made in the primary care therapy areas.  Dedicated funding since 2016 is supporting the recruitment of additional posts in speech and language therapy provision and psychology services, both with a particular focus on children.  Most recently, budget 2018 provided funding for additional occupational therapists.  The new primary care centres are equipped to facilitate the new primary care staff that are being recruited.  The centres will, into the future, be capable of facilitating additional new staff that may be required as the plans for further shifts of activity to primary care are implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Another measure outlined by the Minister is the importance of greater access to diagnostics in the community.  Access to diagnostics for GPs in the community will alleviate some pressures on the hospital system to provide such services.  That is why we have put in place enhanced community diagnostic programmes for ultrasound and X-ray.  Since 2015, the HSE developed a service whereby a GP can refer medical card and GP visit card adult patients for ultrasound scans currently in ten primary care sites across the west and south.  By the end of November 2017, more than 19,000 scans had been undertaken, which exceeded the expected activity in 2017 by nearly 15%, and the onward referral rate to a hospital setting for further radiological-medical investigations increased by between 15% and 20%.  This low onward referral rate demonstrates the success of the initiative arid highlights the effectiveness of having direct access to ultrasound available for GPs and is further relieving pressure on hospital services and decreasing waiting lists.  Currently four primary care centres have on-site X-ray facilities available and the Minister has previously highlighted the success of the Castlebar centre, for example, where the services are run under the governance of the radiology department in Mayo University Hospital.  There are now no waiting lists in Mayo for X-ray services which are a vast improvement on the waiting list figure of 517 for this service in the county in April 2017 before the start of the service.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that future primary care centres will have rooms that meet radiology specifications and may provide X-ray services to patients.  Further phased expansion of the community diagnostic programmes in primary care sites will be undertaken in 2011.  We must continue to build on these developments and we must further seek to expand our primary care provision.  A key element of this will be negotiation of a new modern responsive contract for GP services.  As the Minister for Health stated earlier, the provision of a &euro;25 million primary care fund from budget 2018 reflects the commitment of the Government to ensuring that primary care sector now and in the future is equipped to deliver modern, responsive and effective health care provision for all in our society.<\/p>  <p>  With the Sl&aacute;intecare report, for the first time, we have political consensus on the vision and direction of travel for our health services and as such a solid platform for reform.  The Government has affirmed its commitment to implementing a significant programme of reform, as outlined in the report, and this will set out our ambitions for the next decade and concrete plans for the immediate years ahead.  As outlined by the Minister earlier, this detailed work will be overseen by a new Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted that the health system capacity review is complete and will be brought to Government next week.  This will provide the evidence we need to make important decisions regarding hospital capacity at individual, regional and national level.  The analysis carried out as part of the review indicates that given current capacity constraints and demographic projections for the next 15 years, we will have to invest in capacity across all aspects of the health service, including beds in acute hospitals and across the community.  It is important that there is a full appreciation of our demographic profile. The rate of increase in the aged over 65 cohort is considerable.  This increase is happening quickly and steeply and will become even more pronounced over the next 15 years.  The following are key headline projections from the analysis of the period 2016-2031.  There was a 12% growth in overall population, with a 59% growth in the age 65 and over population and 95% growth in the age 85 and over population.  We will, therefore, need to put the supports in place for much greater numbers of older people in the future, both home care and residential care.  We will need better supports in primary care to manage chronic disease and multi-morbidity.<\/p>  <p>  Without significant reform of and investment in community-based services, acute care will continue to be the default option for the majority of care needs, and our hospital services will become even more unsustainable.  The Minister asked me to point out that more than 750,000 additional home care package hours will be provided this year.  The findings of the review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity that is needed.  It is important that this be undertaken in a planned way and the new national development plan will give us the vehicle for doing this.<\/p><p> Reform alone will not fix all the problems that exist.  People are living longer and are healthier than ever before, as many Members have said, and this is something to be celebrated.  In addressing the many challenges facing our hospitals, we must not lose sight of the fact the best way to address these challenges is to ensure that citizens have as healthy a lifestyle as possible.  In 2013, the Government launched the Healthy Ireland framework.  The vision of the framework is to address the threats to public health posed by issues such as obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse and physical inactivity.  Significant progress has been made in implementing the framework since its launch, with the development of a suite of national policies and strategies, including A Healthy Weight For Ireland, the national obesity policy and action plan, and Get Ireland Active!, the national physical activity plan.<\/p> <p> It is vital also to remember that health is not just the responsibility of the Department of Health and the HSE; it requires a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach.  Since the launch of the Healthy Ireland framework, we have established a number of cross-sectoral partnerships with other Government Departments, agencies, NGOs, business and the private sector, and the voluntary sector in order to drive the Healthy Ireland agenda.  We are seeing the results of this work on the ground in the success of national and local initiatives such as Operation Transformation, park runs, the Great Dublin Bike Ride and a host of other initiatives.  I can assure the House this progress will continue in the months and years to come.<\/p> <p> I know we all wish for a better health service and improved hospital services.  I would like to reassure my colleagues this remains a priority for this Government and we will continue to work hard and stay focused on this issue.  I have listened carefully to the concerns and issues that have been raised by Members this evening.  As a public representative in my constituency and in my work as a politician, I have heard individual stories and listened to the individual problems on the ground.  I think it is beholden on us all, no matter what party we are in, or for those in no party, to do our utmost to continue to work together to resolve many of the issues that have been highlighted in this debate.  I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising this very important issue.  I am delighted the Government has decided to not object to the motion.<\/p> <p> On a personal note, I ended up in accident and emergency on Christmas Day with my husband, who was taken very seriously ill.  I have to say I was overwhelmed by the care given by the nurses and doctors, and even more so by the general staff who were there to give out the tea and the sandwiches, and so on.  In general, we have a fantastic health service with fantastic people working in it.  It is unfortunate that, in 2018, we still have people on trolleys filling our accident and emergency units and maybe not getting the service they deserve in a timely manner.  It is time to put political views aside and to work together to resolve any issues we have into the future.  I know Deputy Harty, who is a doctor, and the other Members present all feel the same.<\/p> <p> I thank Members for their participation in the debate.  I again thank Deputy O'Reilly.  I want to express the Minister's sincere apologies that he could not remain until the end of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600057#EEE00200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516143300,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity to express the hope that the Minister of State's husband makes a full recovery and that he is in good health.  I echo her comments in regard to the hospital staff.  There is no doubt about it and all Deputies have reflected on the fact the quality of staff in our health service is extraordinary right through the ranks.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said we need to set politics aside.  I have always been opposed to that idea.  People sometimes equate partisan point-scoring with politics but they are not the same thing.  I and my party have a political analysis of our health service and what is wrong with it.  We make no apologies for that and we will not be setting it aside for anyone.  This does not mean we cannot co-operate with Government and Opposition Deputies in trying to find areas of common ground.  However, I believe we have a different analysis of the manner in which a health service should function.<\/p>  <p>  It is likely that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, have heard many Deputies from across Ireland speaking about the situation in their localities regarding people on trolleys.  The Ministers, with the Department and HSE staff, will be particularly aware of the situation in Cork given the landmark and significant decisions that were taken there in recent weeks.  The scale of the trolley crisis in Cork is enormous.  Some 9,150 people spent time on trolleys in Cork from January to November of last year.  On stopping somebody on the street in Cork, one would be as likely to find they had been on a trolley in the last 12 months as to have been at a county final or at any number of big public events.  The numbers we are talking about affected every community in the city and county, and probably nearly every family.  Even today, there are 31 people on trolleys in Cork University Hospital and another ten in Mercy University Hospital, and it was quite a bit more than that on other occasions, with the number reaching 60 at times in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  This is nothing short of a national scandal.  An item that underlines this is that we learned in recent weeks that 30 patients were transferred from Cork University Hospital to a private hospital.  This is a clear mark of the failure of the HSE to deal with the crisis and the failure of its policies.  The problems in our health sector have risen to extraordinary levels and our public system is at or beyond breaking point.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; an fhaill&iacute; in&aacute;r gc&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte, an fhaill&iacute; i bpolasaithe an Rialtais agus an fhaill&iacute; i nd&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im in&aacute;r gcuid oispid&eacute;al.  It also means that further funds will have been diverted from the public system to the private system which, in different guises, has been a reliable pressure valve for the Government in recent years.  Of course, I am glad that people were treated but this is akin to the HSE declaring it can no longer cope and that the public system can no longer cope.<\/p>  <p>  There is a cost to this, however, and we need to know from the Minister what this is going to cost the public system.  There are budgets but these have been exceeded in recent years.  Already, in January, we are spending money on private care in private hospitals.  Clearly, it is essential that people get the treatment they need but it is utterly shocking that the authorities have essentially accepted that the capacity does not exist in the public system.  Indeed, the fact there are private hospitals operating and thriving is further proof that the public system is in crisis.  Business people have seen a gap in the market and they see the public system is beyond creaking and is collapsing, and they know that people do not have confidence in it.  That is truly an indictment of Government policy over many years.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy O'Reilly on what is a very detailed motion which outlines the actions that need to be taken.  While I welcome that the Minister intends to support it, nonetheless, I do not believe the Government when it says it will implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is not to say I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, or the Minister, Deputy Harris, but I simply do not believe that Fine Gael and the Government will ultimately throw their weight behind this and make the changes that are necessary.  This is not a new problem.  Twelve years ago to this day there were 380 people lying on hospital trolleys and that was under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government with plenty of money.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have had almost a century to establish a proper health care system, free at the point of access, but they have not done so.  For me, that is a point of ideology and due to the fact they have simply never truly believed in the kind of public system that I believe the public demands and deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011600058#FFF00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1516143300,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I remember very well the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, declaring trolley numbers a national emergency - a crisis to be faced with all the resources and resolve possible.

On 2 January of this year, two weeks ago today, the trolley figures reached a new high of 677 across our public hospital network.<\/p><p>That says everything about the \"resolve\" of a succession of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael-led Governments regarding our health services over all those years.

Many of these were aged and infirm, some were children and all were in hospital for bed admissions.<\/p> <p> I note the recent acknowledgment by the Minister, Deputy Harris, that more hospital beds were needed, hopefully with all of the staff and other resourcing that any worthwhile increase would require.  I remember a series of former holders of his portfolio throwing cold water on that obvious need when I raised it on the floor of this Chamber time after time.  It is bizarre to me that some voices in quarters have felt compelled to welcome the Minister's recent commentary but that is where we are - a Minister for Health has at last recognised or at least publicly acknowledged that more beds are needed and, judging from his remarks, more hospitals.<\/p> <p> In the short time available to me, might I urge the Minister to consider re-examining the potential of some of the smaller hospital units that his party and Fianna F&aacute;il before it stripped of key services?
