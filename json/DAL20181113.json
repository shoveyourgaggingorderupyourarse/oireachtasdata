In particular, I refer to Marymount in Cork, Blanchardstown, Raheny, Galway Hospice and the mid-west hospice in Milford, Co. Limerick.  They are continually being disadvantaged by Government policy and left in unsustainable positions in terms of funding, recruitment and retention.  The recent Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, agreement worsens their position and creates an unsustainable funding pathway for them to retain and recruit staff because essentially it breaks the historic link these hospices had with their HSE employees and confirms a two-tier workforce in perpetuity.  The agreement covers only those who worked in the hospices at the time the FEMPI legislation was introduced.  New people coming in are not covered.  There is no retrospection.<\/p>  <p>  The entire approach of Government for the past year and a half has been as mean-spirited as one can get towards these hospices.  It is a slap in the face to the thousands of volunteers who support them and to the public who fundraise for them.  It flies in the face of the national palliative care strategy, which the Government announced with fanfare last year.  It is also contrary to the policies of Sl&aacute;intecare, which recommends full integration of palliative care with acute hospital care within the health service.  Hospices are an essential part of our health service; they are not an ancillary service.  The Government's approach to pay policy has been to continue to treat them as an ancillary service.  They provide community care, home care packages and vital interventions at critical parts of a person's journey with cancer or other serious illnesses.  Their model is the one we should aspire to for other areas of care within our health services.  They are enormously important in alleviating pressures on acute services.<\/p><p>I met with representatives of Marymount Hospice yesterday.  It costs approximately &euro;20 million to run it on current funding, some &euro;3 million of which is raised by the citizens of Cork and the surrounding region.  The same can be said of Milford, Galway, Blanchardstown and Raheny, yet they are treated in a discriminatory manner by the Government, which must stop.  In Marymount's case, as the people to whom I spoke made clear, they had to fund the pay restoration under the national agreement, which cost &euro;277,000 in 2017, &euro;562,000 to date this year and is expected to cost &euro;798,000 for the full year.  They told me they cannot afford to deliver the current quantum of services.  Decisions are under consideration and review about cuts to services.  They had to cancel community visits to people and they are considering closing specialist palliative care beds in the hospice, which could happen as early as next January.  <\/p> <p> Is it not time to treat these hospices as essential parts of our health service, as other hospitals and health institutions are, and transition them to section 38 agencies in order that they can enjoy the same payscales as everybody else within the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542074700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised the importance and value of our hospices and the hospice movement on many occasions.  He often mentions Marymount, which he knows well, and St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown and Raheny, which I know well as a constituency Deputy.  We have seen enormous improvements in recent years in end-of-life care and palliative care, ensuring more people die in a hospice or at home than in a hospital.  This means that, in general, people who are in their final few days or weeks can pass away with dignity and comfort, managed in a pain-free environment, in a way that is much more difficult to do in a busy hospital.  Those improvements will continue and new hospitals are being provided in Wicklow and Castlebar, for example.  There are also plans to develop palliative care in Drogheda and Waterford as well as the midlands, should we be able to come to an agreement among the different counties on an appropriate site.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare proposes that palliative care become universal, but it does not specifically propose that it be taken into the public sector as a section 38 agency.  Rather, it proposes that it be universal.  When I asked the Sl&aacute;intecare team what that means, it said that it should be provided in all parts of the country because it is not now, or at least not to the extent that it is in other parts.  There has been much Government support for hospices in recent years, such as for St. Francis Hospice, to which the Deputy referred, where the land by the Government through my predecessor, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, while the equipment and staffing were provided by this Government when we came to office.  <\/p>  <p>  The agreement to which the Deputy refers was brokered at the WRC.  It acknowledges there is a difference between section 39 and section 38 bodies, as he will understand.  The difference is that section 39 bodies are typically charities, private institutions and, in some cases, companies.  They are not part of the public service and they are not owned by the public.  The land and the buildings are not owned by the public, and nor are the pension liabilities or the debts.  If some bodies want to move their classification from section 39 to section 38, we can consider and talk about that, but there will also be consequences to that, namely, relating to ownership, legacy pension liabilities, legacy debts, control, membership of boards and so on.  These matters would have to be resolved.  If some section 39 bodies are willing to give up some or all of their independence and transfer their lands and ownerships in return for becoming part of the public service, that is the type of thing we could discuss.  The board of each individual section 39 body, however, would have to decide for itself that it wants to go down that road and it would have to be negotiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1542074700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Words come cheap from Government.  During the budget talks, the Taoiseach set his face against any consideration of bringing those agencies under section 38.  He said it was not even being considered.  He can make all the announcements he likes, such as the palliative care strategy or Sl&aacute;intecare, but they mean nothing in the real world.

There will be a HSE hospice network while those in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Blanchardstown  will be continually disadvantaged by the Government.  The WRC agreement is a cover operation.  The unions look after their members, which is their job.

It illustrated again in some detail the horrific treatment of Maurice McCabe for daring to speak out about Garda malpractice in the Cavan Monaghan division.  We are agreed that Maurice is a good and honourable man of incredible strength.  He, his wife, Lorraine, and their family deserve not only our support and solidarity but also our gratitude.  For daring to speak out and for putting his head above the parapet, Maurice was smeared and bullied by fellow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He was the subject of the most despicable type of character assassination imaginable.  That is a fact.  The Charleton tribunal found that Maurice was \"repulsively denigrated\" for being nothing more than a good citizen and police officer.  The tribunal also established that the then Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, undertook a most disgraceful attack on Maurice, aided and abetted by his press officer, Dave Taylor.<\/p>  <p>  Against that backdrop, Maurice McCabe is justifiably pursuing legal action against the State and Maurice Callinan.  However, it has emerged in recent days that the State will pay Mr. Callinan's legal fees, using taxpayer's money, which is outrageous.  Martin Callinan is a man who went around telling people falsely and without foundation that Maurice McCabe was a child sex abuser who should not be trusted.<\/p><p>At the weekend the Taoiseach stated: \"As a former State employee who is being sued in the course of his work it is norm for the State to offer representation...\".  However, I put it to the Taoiseach that this is not a normal case.  Mr. Callinan has, of course, every right to defend himself in court but in this case, which is being taken by the person he repulsively denigrated, he should not get one red cent of State money.  Setting out to destroy Maurice McCabe was his doing and he should face the consequences of his actions.  The reputation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as we all know, was deeply damaged by this episode.  For the State to now come to Mr. Callinan's aid by way of providing for his legal fees is simply not acceptable.<\/p> <p> The decision taken by the acting Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, to recommend, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, that a defence be funded by the State was a decision taken before the tribunal had concluded and before it had found so heavily against Martin Callinan.<\/p> <p> The State has already failed Maurice McCabe on numerous occasions and now it looks set to support the individual who went to extraordinary lengths to destroy his character.  I want the Taoiseach to state categorically here this afternoon that this will not be the case.  I want him to ensure that Mr. Callinan funds his own legal defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300005#C01900","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542075600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>First, once again, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Maurice McCabe, the enormous service he has done to this country and his honesty and decency.

Some people will have seen the programme on RTE television last night and for many people who have not met Maurice McCabe and do not know him this may have been the first time they had a chance to hear his voice and understand what he, his wife and family went through for nearly a decade merely for telling the truth and merely for having the courage to expose and stand up to wrongdoing and malfeasance in the organisation, for which he worked, and how he was treated not just in some cases by senior people in the Garda but also by his peers.  It is really sad to see that in our public service, when somebody in a public service position points out what is wrong and their own peers, instead of supporting them, turn on them.  That was really sad to see.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to say that this is not a normal case.  It is not.  The decision to offer State representation to the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, was made in July.  That was prior to the report of the disclosures tribunal and was done in accordance with section 48 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  We now have a tribunal of inquiry established by this House and that tribunal of inquiry has made findings.  That allows us to review the position, and the position is being reviewed at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that the fact the State is offering and providing legal representation to the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, does not mean the State will pay for the defence or even necessarily that there will be a defence.  I would like to see this case settled, and I hope it can be settled to the satisfaction of Maurice and Lorraine McCabe sooner rather than later.  I have also asked the Attorney General to advise the Government and to give us legal advice on whether we would be in a position to pursue both the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, and also Mr. Taylor for a contribution to any damages that may be paid.

The new Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, has done the same.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with section 48 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Minister, on the recommendation of the then Garda Commissioner, approved to grant State representation to Mr. Callinan for the purpose of that case.  That was done in July before the tribunal reported.  He, along with all other parties in that action, is currently represented by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  It is important to say on the record of the D&aacute;il that State representation does not constitute an undertaking or a grant of indemnity.  That has never been granted.

That means women are working for more than a month free of charge compared to men annually.  One of the great benefits of joining the European Union was a requirement of equal pay for equal work, as well as the abolition of the naked bias, such as the law which required women to leave the public service on marriage.  We brought in equal pay legislation in 1974 - a long time ago - but we still await pay parity.  In the past, this was explained by differences in qualifications between men and women.  Today, however, significantly more young women than men have third-level qualifications.  Previously, we might have explained that the pay gap happened because many women stopped working while their children were in school.  This is no longer the case for a great number of families.<\/p>  <p>  There is a gender difference in the professions taken up by men and women which, in turn, might explain some of the differences in pay.  There is a question, however, about whether we value women&rsquo;s work as much as we do that of men.  There is a real question as to whether men and women are being paid equally for the same work.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has progressed legislation through all Stages in the Seanad for the mandatory reporting by larger companies of the levels of pay by gender.  The Government has promised its own legislation in this area but it has not been delivered.  We are happy to work with the Government through all D&aacute;il Stages to ensure this legislation can be swiftly enacted into law.  We know mandatory reporting has worked in other countries and we believe it will work here.  In some cases, companies may not even be aware of the extent of the wage differences in their own workforce.  Ignorance is no excuse, however.  The legislation which the Labour Party has put forward would remove that excuse.<\/p><p>Does the Government agree that a 14% gender pay gap is both unacceptable and unsustainable?  Will it undertake to support the Labour Party's legislation, which has already been passed by the Seanad, and help it through the D&aacute;il as the swiftest mechanism to address this important issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300007#E00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542076200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The Government accepts that the gender pay gap of 14% is unacceptable, unfair and a hallmark of gender inequality in our society.  The Deputy will also be aware that such pay gaps are not unique to Ireland and exist across the developed world, including, even, very progressive Nordic countries which have larger gender pay gaps than Ireland.  However, that does not make it in any way acceptable.  Equal pay for equal work was introduced in 1974 as a consequence of European law and it has made a real difference.  More than 30 years later, however, we continue to have a gender pay gap for multiple reasons.  One reason is that more women work on a part-time basis than men, which is often because women are still expected to bear the greater burden of caring in society, including caring for children and older people, and are likely to work part-time as a result.  That is not something that is simple to change.  It can be changed, however, by providing more subsidised childcare, as we are doing, and by providing paternity benefit to men so that more men take up caring roles.  That is one of the things that has to change.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is, of course, gender bias in promotions.  I attended the National Gallery yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, for the launch of the actions we are taking in the higher education sector.  This is just one example.  While approximately 50% of the lecturers in our universities and institutes of technology are female, it is only 25% when one gets up to the professor level.  It is evident that we need to put accelerators in place so that more women are promoted and in that way help to close the gender pay gap.  The Deputy will be aware of the decisions we made in that regard yesterday.  They are very progressive, albeit controversial in parts.  On 26 June last, we approved the general scheme of the gender pay gap information Bill.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality will carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme on 21 November.  That is in only eight days' time.  I appeal to all parties in the House to get that scrutiny done quickly and before the end of the year so that we can proceed to legislate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300008#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1542076200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>That the gap in other countries is worse is, the Taoiseach says, no excuse and yet he uses it as an excuse.

If the Government is serious about addressing the issue, it will surely not matter whether the Bill comes from the Labour Party or is drafted by Government.  There was no fundamental issue with the legislation as it passed through the Seanad and, in fact, a promise to support it was made.

We protested the treatment of the young woman involved at her clothing being passed around the jury.  This week, another young woman suffered humiliation during a rape trial in Cork.  We cannot comment on the verdict in the case but we need to focus on the lessons.  Why has nothing yet been done to stop the routine use of rape myths in trials?  How concerned is the Government about the chilling effect this is having on victims coming forward?  A barrister told the jury to \"look at the way she was dressed\", that she was \"open to meeting someone\" because she was \"wearing a thong with a lace front\".  A 17 year old was put in the dock for her choice of underwear.  She was \"open to meeting someone\": the implication was that she was asking for it.<\/p>  <p>  Women in this country are getting a little bit weary of the routine victim-blaming in Irish courts and the failure of lawmakers in this House to do anything about it.  Either the Judiciary believes these rape myths, in which case they should be forced to undergo education - it should not be voluntary - or they are being used to introduce sexist stereotypes which they know exist in society and among juries.  I suspect the latter.  Recently we have seen clothes, fake tan and even contraception being used to discredit women who have the bravery to go to court.  The most recent study by the Rape Crisis Network estimated that, at best, 10% of rapes are ever reported and only one in 40 rapes is appropriately punished.  How heroic and what levels of fortitude must one have to pursue a rape trial in this country, particularly when research shows there is less chance of the accused being convicted if the complainant is young, knew the rapist, had consumed any alcohol or drugs or is from a working-class background and up against a well-paid lawyer?<\/p>  <p>  We do not have data in this country because of the lack of funding for an updated Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report, but the Trades Union Congress, TUC, in Britain found that 63% of 18 to 24 year olds have experienced sexual harassment at work, as have 69% of hospitality workers and 67% of manual workers.  Last week, Google workers effectively took strike action protesting sexual harassment and inequality even though they do not have a union.  The #MeToo campaign has to be taken into the workplace and into society.  Women and men see the necessity of taking action because they cannot wait for the pace of change being offered by this Parliament.  Protests against the conduct of the trial will take place in five cities, including rallies at the Spire in Dublin and on St. Patrick's Street in Cork at 1 p.m. tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  It might seem embarrassing to show a thong here in this incongruous setting of the D&aacute;il, but the reason I am doing it is, how do you think a rape victim or a woman feels at her underwear being shown in the incongruous setting of a courtroom?

Nobody who is a victim of sexual violence or rape is ever to blame for the crime committed on them.  I believe any defence on those lines is absolutely reprehensible.  Let me put that very clearly on the record of this D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> In terms of any individual court cases, the Deputy knows how the courts work.  We live in a democracy.  This is Parliament.  Parliament is separate from the courts.  When there is a prosecution, there is a defence.  The judge and jury hear all the evidence presented during the trial.  The jury comes to a decision on whether there is a conviction and then the judge rules on an appropriate sentence.  We cannot interfere in the way individual court cases are conducted.  However, I believe we need to examine this matter.  A review has been established under the chairmanship of Tom O'Malley, who is a recognised expert in this area.

We need massive legal changes.  We need a discussion about consent throughout the length and breadth of society.  The Government could start this process by approving the Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018 immediately.  This Bill, which has been proposed by Solidarity, has consent at its core.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to have compulsory training for the Judiciary and for juries?  Provision should also be made for advocates for survivors.  If we put the survivor at the centre of this process, we will ensure we do not maintain the current high attrition rate for sexual cases.  Most people have to wait two or three years to have their cases heard.  All the cuts to the rape crisis centres imposed over the last decade need to be reversed.  This will ensure the centres can do the type of research that is necessary.  Will the Government set up the specialist Garda units that were apparently dropped, for whatever reason?  We know there is a report coming from Tom O'Malley.

I raise this in the context of the programme for Government, the cancer strategy and the timely attention to people in difficult situations.  It is a very challenging diagnosis.  The woman was given an appointment for 9 November last and was told to arrive fasting on that day at 7 a.m.  She had to come up to Dublin the day before.  People have to make arrangements when they are travelling from the country to Dublin hospitals.  A phone call came to say the operation was cancelled along with 34 others because of some edict from on high.  The Minister for Health was mentioned but I presume it was not someone at that level.  There was a fear of overcrowding in the accident and emergency department and that there was a need to preserve beds and cancel what were considered to be elective procedures.  No guarantees could be given as to when the procedures would take place or that such an event would not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an uncommon phenomenon but it seems to be happening with greater frequency.  It is an extremely worrying development because part of the success of cancer strategies has been the idea that elective treatment and treatment generally would be ring-fenced and that in the centres of excellence there would be timelines for treatment after diagnosis which would not be breached by the pressures that acute services can impose on a hospital.  I am aware of other hospitals where there are breaches and the timelines that were originally set down for treatment in the aftermath of diagnosis are not being met because of pressures on the acute tertiary hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach concerned about that?

In the aftermath of the budget, the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il said he would seek additional tax breaks for landlords in the Bill.  We never got to the bottom of what precisely those would be.  However, I want to know whether the Taoiseach will provide a tax break for renters.<\/p><p>Yesterday's quarterly rental report from <i>daft.ie<\/i>shows rent has risen to an all-time high of &euro;1,334 per month.  In every single county in the State, the 4% rent pressure zone, RPZ, cap is being breached.  In Galway city, a RPZ, average rent is 16% higher than in the same period last year.  That is four times the 4% cap.  Eighteen counties in addition to Galway show double-digit increases, including 20% increases in Limerick and Waterford cities.  It is, therefore, time for the Taoiseach to accept that his approach to tackling spiralling rent increases has categorically failed.  What we need if we are to tackle this crisis are an immediate three-year rent freeze and tax relief for tenants.  Sinn F&eacute;in will reintroduce its amendments to the Finance Bill next week to provide such tax relief.

The Bill is similar to one I introduced in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il and another one we introduced in this D&aacute;il in 2016.  <\/p><p>The Bill seeks to amend the Constitution to ensure Ireland will not and could not aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for a war, save with the assent of the D&aacute;il.  It also affirms that Ireland is a neutral State and that the State should have a policy of non-membership of military alliances.  The continued use of Shannon Airport for foreign militaries to facilitate their ongoing wars, coupled with the increased militarisation of the EU and this State's deeper integration in the EU's military system through permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, ensures this Bill is timely.<\/p> <p> I will ask the Government and all parties and groups to support the Bill when it appears for debate and to stop undermining Irish neutrality.

Some 120 years later in 1914, as the First World War or Great War, as some call it, was beginning, the Irish Neutrality League issued its first circular, which was signed by its president, James Connolly.  Some 100 years after more than 40,000 or 50,000 Irishmen died in that imperialist war, the proud tradition of not aligning ourselves with belligerents and imperialists' resource wars is not enshrined in the Constitution.  In fact, the opposite is the case, especially since 1997 when Fianna F&aacute;il signed up to the NATO's Partnership for Peace.<\/p><p>This weekend I will open an international conference in this city.  It is the first international conference against US and NATO military bases and it will be held in Liberty Hall on Friday.  Guests from all around the world hold Ireland in such high regard that Ireland was selected for this conference, but that will not last if this Government, like recent others, continues to allow Shannon Airport to continue to be used as a US Army forward base, as it has been since 2002, or if it continues to go along with the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron or those in the European Commission, such as Jean-Claude Juncker, whose intention is to build a real European army through PESCO and so on and to have it in place by the middle of the next decade.<\/p><p>When the Bill appears on Second Stage, I hope the D&aacute;il will reconsider how it has voted in the past.  Although the numbers voting for Private Members' Bills have increased, I urge both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to consider their approach, not least in memory of the imperialist war and the effect it had on Ireland.  Ireland has such a proud tradition internationally of not being aligned to one side or another in wars and, therefore, I urge Deputies to endorse the Bill in order that we can ask the people their opinion.  Why is the Government continuously afraid of asking the people for their opinion on this issue?  The only poll that was done on this issue in recent times showed an overwhelming majority of Irish people are in favour of the intent of this legislation and, therefore, I urge the D&aacute;il to endorse the Bill when it comes before it again and allow the people to have their say.  Perhaps we will, once and for all, enshrine neutrality in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300018#Q00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300018#Q00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300018#Q00400","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542081300,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542081300,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081300,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300018#Q00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081300,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go dt&oacute;gfar an Bille in am Comhalta&iacute;

At all three meetings, I said we wanted the future relationship between the EU and the UK to be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible, but that it was essential that a legally robust backstop is set out clearly in the withdrawal agreement.  I expressed my appreciation for the ongoing efforts of Mr. Barnier and his team in the negotiations with the United Kingdom and thanked all my interlocutors for their robust solidarity with Ireland.  The EU proposals outlined in the draft protocol earlier this year are practical solutions to protect the gains of the peace process and to keep the Border as open and invisible as it is today.  They represent no threat to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  We want to see a future relationship agreed between the EU and the UK that makes the backstop unnecessary once the period of transition ends, but that outcome cannot be guaranteed.  The backstop must, therefore, be in place as part of the Irish protocol to offer full confidence that under no circumstances will there be a return to a hard border in Ireland.  My interlocutors reaffirmed their solidarity with Ireland and reiterated their strong view that the UK is under an obligation to deliver on the clear commitments and guarantees that Prime Minister May gave in December, March and September if there is to be a satisfactory withdrawal agreement, including provision for a transition period to the end of 2020.  I assure the House that these and other reassurances of solidarity that I receive in private are every bit as robust as those voiced in public.  EU backing has been unwavering.  Ongoing political engagement with our partners remains crucial and I will continue to take every opportunity to ensure our partners fully understand our particular concerns to enable the best possible outcome for this country.<\/p>  <p>  Along with my fellow members of the European Council, I met Mr. Tusk and Mr. Barnier again at our most recent summit in Brussels on 17 and 18 October.  I have seen President Tusk twice since then, including at the European People's Party conference in Helsinki.  I also recently met President Juncker in Paris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300018#Q01950","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081300,"counter":235,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that recently there has been a significant amount of coverage of the Brexit negotiations, but there continues to be little hard detail about what has been agreed.  The practice of ongoing commentary caused many problems over the past year and it is understandable that the EU side is determined to allow maximum room to manoeuvre in the discussions.  There is a desire to try to create some space to allow people engage in negotiations without megaphone diplomacy.  It is noteworthy that Tony Connolly's piece last Saturday suggested that our Ministers had been asked to stop constantly commenting and making political points during the latest phase of discussions.<\/p><p>From what we can see, it seems clear that there is a deal on the table with the organisation of its choreography in London the outstanding issue.  The London Government has secured its main objective of having a buffer of access to the customs union until it is ready for an alternative to seeking to maintain control of when it should exit that union.  Britain staying in the customs union is good for Ireland because there has been a lamentable lack of focus on the east-west axis.  Our trade with Britain is critical and the idea of Britain staying in the customs union is one that should be encouraged, and for longer than some in the British Parliament would wish.<\/p> <p> On the deal specific to Northern Ireland, the British Attorney General is reported as being prepared to argue that the wording is flexible, that the withdrawal treaty is, by definition, not capable of permanently binding the United Kingdom and that the backstop is capable of being ended if the United Kingdom so desires.  As a result of a motion currently before the House of Commons, the advice of the British Attorney General will be made available.  I understand that the British Government recently decided to make its legal advice available to the Commons.  Our Attorney General was in Brussels last week to examine the proposed wordings.  There is a real possibility that there will be one wording on the backstop but two contradictory legal interpretations as to what it means.  It is entirely conceivable that the United Kingdom Government will insist that it can end the backstop unilaterally while our Government will state that it cannot.  We may have an agreement with multiple interpretations.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach assure the House that he will, at the very least, make available to it the same level of information that will be available to Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, namely, the legal advice?  We cannot have British parliamentarians having more information available to them than is available to their Irish counterparts.  If there is a deal, will the Taoiseach commit to delivering full information on the legal implications?  Will he also commit to publishing an immediate update of economic forecasts of the implications of what is agreed?  Brexit has already had a significant economic impact on Britain and Ireland.  We have a right to know the best estimates regarding its future impact while the agreements are being discussed and not merely after they have been concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300018#Q02000","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542081900,"counter":237,"content":"<p>During his discussions with European colleagues, has the Taoiseach raised the issue of Palestine?  This year, the EU has the chair of the Kimberley process, which is the certification process for the diamond industry and its exports.  Ireland will hold the chair between 12 and 16 November.  A key aspect of the Kimberley process is to prohibit the export of blood or conflict diamonds.  Palestinian activists and civil society have called for the Kimberley process to include conflict diamonds coming from Israel on the grounds that the latter is engaged in ongoing systematic abuse of human rights, most recently launching a bombing raid on Gaza in which five people were killed.  That followed a covert Israeli military operation on Sunday during which seven Palestinians were killed and also the killing of four Palestinians only a few weeks earlier.  Over 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Great March of Return this year.  Should Ireland not use a power that we will hold this week as chair of the Kimberley process, to call Israel out and impose a sanction which would have a real impact?  We ought to demand that Israel no longer has a diamond trade while it continues to deny and suppress Palestinians their basic rights and wantonly kills individuals as part of its brutal oppression of the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300019#R00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081900,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I echo Deputy Boyd Barrett's concerns about the ongoing situation in Palestine, the siege there and the continued breaches of international law by the State of Israel.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to Brexit and the imminent deal, there have been several waves of discussion and negotiation regarding the Irish protocol.  The initial position held by the British Government, notwithstanding commitments into which it had previously entered, was to contest the notion that there is a need for a specific backstop for Ireland.  We have come through the discussion regarding the backstop's scope.  While it was ongoing, there were those - Government and others - that held steady in insisting that Northern Ireland is not as British as Finchley, that we have particularly Irish concerns and needs which must be met and that, therefore, a bespoke solution and insurance policy are required.<\/p>  <p>  We then moved to the question of a backstop's duration.  Tension emerged between the British demand for a something that would be temporary and the Irish demand for something enduring.  Many Deputies argued that temporary protections are no protections at all.  I understood that we were all on the same page in respect of these matters.  In our dealings with the British Government, Michel Barnier, Guy Verhofstadt and others, we went to great lengths to reiterate our position, which we believe to be commonly held across the Irish political landscape.  Then the Taoiseach began to talk about a review clause and mechanism.  I am deeply troubled and puzzled by that.  Will the Taoiseach explain what this is and its provenance?  I want him to consider the following points.  First, in any review clause or mechanism, this State, and whoever is in Government, will not be a direct party to such a review.  Second, I assure the Taoiseach that even thinking out loud about the concept of a review offers the Tories the prospect of these being temporary little arrangements.  Third, we all spoke of achieving stability and certainty for our politics, society and economy.  By definition, review mechanisms prolong uncertainty.  The Taoiseach was wrong to raise this.  Has he conceded a review mechanism?  Will he clarify if a review mechanism is part of the deal that is on the table?  I cannot understand why he shifted substantively the Government's position at this point in the negotiations.  Has he seen the review wording?  Has the Attorney General similarly viewed words that constitute a review clause, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has suggested?  If the Taoiseach has agreed to this, why has he done so?  If he has not, then why was he thinking out loud along these lines?  At a time when we require clarity of purpose, a singular focus, steadiness and sticking to the bottom line in the context of this country's needs, the Taoiseach has wavered.  His words and actions in this are very dangerous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300019#R00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1542081900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>In the normal course of events, EU policy decisions are taken at EU level and member states get significant time to digest and implement them locally.  Unfortunately, in these negotiations we have moved into classic brinkmanship mode, with all the hard decisions being left to the final hours.  We have heard that negotiators are up until 3 a.m. and resume their meetings at dawn, negotiating in what has been called \"the tunnel\".<\/p><p>Everything is now urgent.  There is little time left for information to be released, digested and analysed.<\/p> <p> Like others, I want to make it clear that we need time to see specifically the structure, content and import of any withdrawal agreement and to make sure we are legally clear before we vote in this House on any of these matters.  Will the Taoiseach make Government officials available to brief us, other Members of the House and parties across the House once the agreement is finalised, if it is finalised, and provide us with any legal interpretation upon which the Government is relying?<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy Martin's point that the east-west part of the equation is extremely important for us.  I say that not only as leader of the Labour Party but as somebody who represents Wexford and Rosslare port.  A UK-wide customs union would be a great advantage but it must be established on a permanent basis.  I cannot see how that could be acceptable to the UK authorities.  We will see what is on offer and what is acceptable to Britain when the time comes.<\/p> <p> I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a review mechanism that was mentioned.  I asked him about that last week and he gave me some answers on it.  Perhaps more has been made of this than it merits but we need clarity on it and the Taoiseach might give us that clarity now.  Has he discussed the review mechanism with Michel Barnier and what is his understanding of what is meant by that term?<\/p> <p> We have had a report today covering the common travel area.  I have had discussions with a number of people on this matter.  Some legal advice I got is that we should not try to codify the common travel area because once we start legally framing it we are perhaps in some ways reducing the rights base of it.  The common travel area is a very shallow term for a very broad range of rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in the UK and UK citizens here right down to access to health services, education, housing and even the right to vote.  My fear is that if we had an acrimonious parting of Britain and if it was perceived by the British, or certainly by the Tory Government, that the Irish issue was at the heart of the reason for an acrimonious departure, then rights enjoyed that are not legally codified and agreed may well disappear.  In private briefings there has been discussions on this but perhaps the Taoiseach would put on the D&aacute;il record what exactly is the extent of negotiations on the rights of Irish citizens and British citizens here which, separate from our European Union rights, would endure in what we now know to be, or call, the common travel area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300019#R00400","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542082500,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Burton has tabled Questions Nos. 8 and 9.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300020#S00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1542082500,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the backstop agreement.

It looks like we are drifting inevitably - I said this a long time ago - to the last few hours of the last night of negotiations.  I encourage the Taoiseach to be forthcoming to the D&aacute;il, on what is a most important decision for everybody on the island of Ireland, for the EU and for the UK, as to where he thinks it stands now.

The negotiations are happening in private.  They are happening in a &quot;tunnel&quot; and in private for a very good reason.  I have always said throughout these talks over the past year and a half that it was not helpful to give a running commentary on negotiations.  It is certainly not in our national interest to do that.  That is particularly true when we are approaching a very sensitive phase.  I believe we are approaching a very sensitive phase now so I hope Deputies will understand why I need to be a little cautious in the way I answer questions.  However, I am very happy to make officials available for confidential briefings with the party leaders and their teams this week and also should we come to the point where we have an agreement.  I would be very happy for that to happen.  I will ask my officials to contact the leaders' offices to set that up as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin was correct in saying that the UK staying in a customs union for a time or staying in a temporary customs arrangement would be beneficial for Ireland because of the benefits of frictionless trade east-west between Britain and Ireland, which is very important for the agrifood sector our small and medium enterprises and also for Northern Ireland.  Let us not forget that much of the trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain goes through Dublin Port and Rosslare.  It is the quickest way to get from Northern Ireland to the midlands and the south of England.  It is not Larne to Stranraer and all the way down.  It is Dublin to Rosslare and across to England.  I hope business in Northern Ireland will see the benefits of the UK staying aligned to the customs union.<\/p><p>  In terms of legal interpretation, again Deputy Martin made a very valid point.  There have been some discussions on this already.  We want to avoid a situation whereby we have an agreement that is made and then, two or three days later, we have the European Union interpreting it differently from the UK.  That is something we are aware of and some consideration has been given to making sure we have a common legal interpretation, as it were, of the agreement whenever it comes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300020#S00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1542082500,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The British Government in the last order said it will make it available to the British Parliament in advance of a vote<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300020#S00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1542082500,"counter":245,"content":"<p>There is a difference there.

It is important that when we talk about the conflict in Israel and Palestine, we do not turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses being committed by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.  Sometimes it seems that if a Palestinian is a victim of human rights abuses by Israel, it is raised.  However, when a Palestinian is a victim of human rights abuses by Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, there is silence.

However, I asked him in a follow-up question what had happened and he said the report was noted.  Since then, I have seen no evidence that the report has been acted on.

As Members have acknowledged and unlike the case with previous Governments, I have focused on involving the whole Cabinet in decision making as far as is practical.  Today, for example, we spent an hour on Brexit.  While Cabinet committees include officials and advisors, they often exclude Ministers.  I like to do more things with Ministers than was the case in the past and often hold bilateral or trilateral meetings, in particular around health and housing.  These meetings involve me, the line Minister and another relevant Minister, usually the Minister for Finance.  We also use the Cabinet committees.  For example, we decided specifically in regard to the O'Toole report on the future of policing that the Cabinet would note it and agree to its publication and that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, would come back to the Cabinet sub-committee with a reasoned response to it and an implementation plan.

This is a matter of great concern to me and my Department.  I am extremely disappointed and embarrassed by our failure to maintain the usually exceptionally high standard of service provided by the staff of the Department. <\/p><p>The root of the difficulty lies in the transfer of the illness benefit scheme to our new core business objectives information technology, IT, platform on 4 August.  The transfer had a number of objectives, including moving the illness benefit payments from a very old IT platform which is approaching end of life to a newer platform which already manages most of my Department&rsquo;s other payment schemes.  We wish to realise cost savings by eliminating the need for labour intensive data entry and enabling the re-use of existing data already on the business objectives platform.  It was hoped that the transfer would facilitate, in due course, with the co-operation of general practitioners, GPs, the move from submission of paper medical certificates by people to one whereby an ecertificate is transmitted electronically from the GP to my Department and the move away from certification each week by a GP to a system whereby a single certificate is provided to cover the entire illness period.<\/p><p>  The system change worked effectively for approximately 80% of those who claim illness benefits but a several difficulties arose which affected payments to a significant number of people.<\/p><p>The redesign of the medical certificate enabled the forms to be scanned rather than manually entered into the system.  However, approximately 50% of GP practices initially continued to submit old form medical certificates which led to long delays in claim processing on the new system in early August.  The delays were overcome by the Department implementing an automatic certification process to ensure that people, including those whose GPs were not submitting the correct certificates, were paid.  Although the process ensured that people received their payments, it resulted in approximately 15% of recipients receiving a split payment in the period from September to November.  People who received split payments were not underpaid as a consequence of this approach; the total amount paid to them was in accordance with their entitlement.  However, they did not expect the payment to be split.<\/p><p>  During this time, my Department deployed additional staff to process old form certificates received from GP practices.  This allowed us to cease the auto-certification process in mid-October and the issue of split payments has since been largely resolved.  Approximately 75% of medical certificates now being received are in the correct format and the remaining forms are being processed manually on the day they are received.<\/p><p>The removal of the auto-certification process has belatedly exposed some underlying deficiencies in the design and operation of the new illness benefit system.  The main issue identified relates to the transition from a payment-in-arrears approach to a current-week payment approach, that is, from a system whereby people are paid their entitlement the week after the submission of a certificate to one whereby they are paid during the week of certification.  This leaves very little tolerance for late receipt of certificates once a claim is in payment, which is causing significant uncertainty for people.  The new system has very tightly defined rules which must be satisfied before a claim and a certificate can be accepted and processed.  Although these rules are valid in principle, they are leading to payments being delayed for reasons that would not have been applied under the legacy system.<\/p><p>My Department has taken three main steps to resolve these issues.  We have deployed additional staff to process the tasks and respond to inquiries arising from the tight application of scheme rules by the new system.  We have developed some new IT routines or work-arounds that, in effect, build in a seven-day buffer to address the payment gap issue and automate the processing of tasks to ensure a faster flow-through of payments.  We are reviewing the design rules in the system, including the payment in the current week rule, and will modify the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.  In addition, my Department continues to engage with the medical profession regarding the implementation of e-certification and single closed certification.  We hope that these measures will lead to an improved delivery of services.  My Department has allocated additional managers to take responsibility for the programme of work I have set out.  The management team includes a full-time assistant secretary and additional staff at principal, assistant principal and higher executive officer level.<\/p><p>  As a consequence of these measures, people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order should now receive their payment entitlements.  Payment volumes were restored to normal levels last week and are being monitored on a daily basis to ensure that they remain at that level.  Any further issues that may arise will be quickly identified and further remedial action may be taken to address them.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that there are always cases - and there were always such cases under the old system - of people&rsquo;s payments being legitimately stopped or paused for a variety of reasons.  Such issues will remain and are normally dealt with via our helpline number.<\/p><p>In addition to the system issues, my Department sincerely acknowledges that it did not communicate effectively with people in advance of the new system coming into effect or in the immediate post-implementation period.  Although my Secretary General wrote to all those in receipt of illness benefit some weeks ago to apologise for the difficulties they were experiencing and to advise of the supports available, I accept that communication was too little, too late and of limited comfort to those unduly distressed.<\/p><p>Our experience with the illness benefit transfer has been a salutary reminder of the longer-term impact of short-term remedial actions.  Such actions, even those taken with the best of intentions, may have unanticipated issues or failures and must be carefully thought through before implementation.  In order to ensure that lessons are identified and learned from this experience, I and my Secretary General have commissioned an independent review of the project to be undertaken by a retired Revenue Commissioner.  I expect that it will be delivered to me by the end of the year and its findings will inform our approach to future system and process changes.<\/p><p>As I have stated, my Department sincerely regrets the distress it has caused to recipients of illness benefits in recent months and we will endeavour to ensure that nothing like this happens in our Department again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300023#V01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1542084300,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I listened carefully to the Minister's reply and I appreciate it.

We have all heard various stories and received emails telling us about instances of hardship caused by this problem in individual cases.  On behalf of all those people, I ask the Minister for an assurance that this will not recur.  Is there any accountability here?  I am not looking for a head or anything like that.

I have heard the apology to people who have been messed up since August.  They have been running from pillar to post in an attempt to get money to which they are entitled.  There was a major failure in communications between the Department and the recipients.  Some community welfare officers around the State were stepping in to give payments, but others were not.  They claimed that people were not entitled to payments because they had received part-payments.<\/p>  <p>  Accountability is the key issue here.  I want to ask specifically about the consultants who rolled out this IT system.  What accountability is there?  The Minister did not act when I first identified and raised these issues in August.  She has acknowledged that action was not taken until October, when three different things were implemented.  Serious questions need to be answered in that respect.  The Minister and the Department have said on a number of occasions that anyone who is entitled to money has received money, but that is clearly not the case.  Two weeks ago, the Minister went on radio on a Friday to say that people would be paid, but that has not happened.  At this moment in time, has everyone received the money to which they are entitled?  In the cases of those who are due money from the Department, have underpayments been made?  Can we have a figure?

I will deliberately refrain from doing so.  Instead, I will set out my point by reading from a letter that some of us have received from a person who continues to serve this country in a very important role.  He speaks for everyone in the letter, which reads:<\/p><blockquote>I am close to a complete breakdown due to a system which is clearly even more overrun than it was prior to the changes, changes which I am guessing were introduced in an effort to improve an already troubled setup, but which are a disaster.  I would like to ask at this point if you may have been aware of these difficulties which many of the population of this country are faced with and, if so, if you might be willing or able to step in to attempt to rectify the endless and needless stresses which this puts on me and on my family and on many many others throughout the country.  What will it take in order for our services and systems to stop pushing already struggling and suffering citizens to despair and desperation?  Is it going to take an example like this on Joe Duffy to highlight the mess the system is in?<\/blockquote><p>This person has paid his taxes and made his contributions.  His case is a genuine one.  When he asked for a bit of help from the system, he found he was entitled to nothing.  It is an awful story.  There is more to it.  I cannot believe it.<\/p><p>People were left hanging on phones.  How many additional people were asked to deal with this?  I want to know whether the officials were in favour of this at all.  Was there a big change in the Minister's Department?  Was that part of the problem?  We are talking about appointments of assistant secretaries general, etc.  We left these people high and dry.  This is an insurance-based system.  People are entitled to their money.  The Minister should not tell people to go down to the community welfare office, where means tests are used and people have to sit looking in.  It is just not right.  I have met people who are destitute.  I think it is a disgrace.  A system should not be changed like this ever again.  Why was it changed at all?  We should never change something that is doing all right.  This is the first time I have ever got angry with the Minister.  I think she is doing a good job but this was an utter failure.  It is rare for me to use words like that.

I am not standing here in front of anybody trying to justify any of the actions that happened over recent months.  I have said on a number of occasions that this is particularly difficult to accept because an exemplary level of service is offered by people in the Department 99.9% of the time.  That is why this debacle is so difficult to try to explain.  I assure Deputy O'Dea that I am not talking in the past tense.  We have issued over 50,000 payments in recent days.  We have issued 29,000 payments this week alone, and it is only Tuesday afternoon.  On average, we would have 50,000 people on illness benefit in any given week.  That has been the average weekly tranche this year, last year and the year before and it will be the expected number of weekly payments next year.<\/p>  <p>  All arrears have been paid.  There may be cases in which arrears are still due.  We are using the business-as-usual manual processing for some of the old forms.  Anyone who is awaiting arrears from an old payment form will receive those arrears this week.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of calls being made to our helpline arising from the changes that have been made in recent weeks.  That is how I know that the vast majority of changes have been successful.  The number of calls has returned to normal levels.  I reiterate that there will always be cases in which people are refused illness payments because they are not entitled to such payments, because the medical certificate was not filled out correctly - the incorrect date may have been used, for example - or because a payment was missed.  There will always be a small number of issues with some of the 50,000 payments that are made each week.  That was true of the old system and it is true of the new system.<\/p>  <p>  The first change that we made was made in August.  It had to be made because just 50% of doctors were using the new form.  I acknowledge and accept that this was our fault.  There was a lack of communication with doctors.  We have learned so much.  It is probably the case that we have yet to identify things that we need to learn.  I hope that will happen on foot of Revenue's independent audit.  The only thing I can genuinely do is apologise sincerely to the people we have distressed over the last couple of months.  It was never our intention to distress them.

I would love to see the remit or terms of reference that were given to the consultants who were involved in this process, particularly with regard to training.  Certainly, the staff in the Department who were expected to administer and deal with this matter did not receive enough training.

It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members' benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage, including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes.  In developing these, it is essential to recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland in order that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.<\/p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  The provisions of this Bill, however, will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 that, among other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12-month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.<\/p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  It has been necessary to consult and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy to achieve a resilient solution.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by the Government, I will request an early date for Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the provisions contained in the EU directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II, will also support positive reform of the Irish occupational pensions sector.  My officials, together with the Pensions Authority, are working on the transposition process to ensure the necessary amendments to existing laws, regulations or administrative provisions will be made to give full effect to the directive.

Approximately 85% of all claims are awarded in the first instance and just 1% are appealed annually.  Nevertheless, my Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for the period January to October 2018 are 30.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.3 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is quasi-judicial and decisions have to be formally written up to a quasi-judicial standard because they are subject to review by the High Court.  Accordingly, the desire to process appeals quickly must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent, of high quality and made in accordance with the legislative provisions and the general principles of fair procedures and natural justice.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past 12 to 18 months to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This has led to longer processing times during this period.<\/p>  <p>  The chief appeals officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her office and that she expects processing times to improve as recently appointed staff develop the necessary experience and expertise to determine appeal decisions to the standard required.<\/p>  <p>  An appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of his or her appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300027#Z00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1542086700,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I am looking at a reply I received to a parliamentary question last September and the appeal times are absolutely ludicrous and unacceptable.

I encourage anybody who is waiting a lengthy period for an appeal decision to go to the local office where we will look after him or her financially.  That is what we do.  In addition to the continuous focus on improving appeal processing times, work is ongoing in the Department on a number of fronts in the context of improving the quality of first-instance decision-making, reducing the number of appeals being received and reducing the time taken in the Department to prepare the appeal submission.  These include: better information gathering at the initial claim stage, which hopefully leads to better outcomes and better decisions; better explanation of the reasons for any decision to make it easier for customers to understand the decisions we make and to reduce the number of unnecessary appeals; a significant programme of training for decision makers on all aspects of their decision making functions.<\/p>  <p>  Social welfare forms are consistently being monitored to ensure they capture sufficient information at the claims stage.  In recent years, for example, improved claim forms were developed for the domiciliary care allowance application and that has resulted in the number of weeks people are waiting for the initial decision to reduce drastically.  We did something similar recently in the case of the carer's allowance application with the Carers Association.  Again, we expect it to yield a number of results for us.

Yes, forms have to be simplified but in the majority of cases it is not forms being filled incorrectly that leads to appeals.  The Minister did not answer my question about additional staff.  A key failure is that there are not enough staff to deal with the level of appeals.  Perhaps she will answer that question.  In addition, other means must be explored.

Most of these schemes are means tested anyway.  People would not apply or qualify for them if their means were not within that realm.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there are almost 6,000 people working in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I cannot answer the question about whether we have asked for more people in the appeals office.  However, we have tried, particularly in the difficult economic circumstances in the last number of years, to do more with the people we have.  In fairness, one can see the result in the fact that our appeal waiting times have come down drastically.  The reasons are that we have improved efficiencies in how we collect our information, we have provided people with new forms to make it simpler and we have tried to help people to understand that they do not need to hold back some information for appeals because they expect that everything will be rejected in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  My main message is that, first, 85% of all applications that are made are found in the affirmative.  In fact, the social welfare Bill tomorrow will provide for automating that to make it even faster for people.  Second, nobody should be waiting without any money.

The second issue has not been mentioned and it relates to the total number of contributions required to be eligible for consideration in the first instance.

This is important legislation, the key objective of which is to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours in all sectors of employment.<\/p><p>Good progress has been made over the past number of years, in the context of our economic recovery, to create new job opportunities, the majority of which are full-time positions.  While this is great, we must remember those people who, not by choice, are in less secure arrangements and may not know from week to week what hours they are working.  This makes it difficult for them to plan their lives outside work.  The Bill will significantly improve the employment protections for all of those people.  I want the Bill to complete its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible in the current session.  If we all work closely together, we will get this out of the Seanad and back into the D&aacute;il and completed before Christmas so that we can deliver for the people who are in those precarious situations this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300029#BB00700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1542087900,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I am glad to see this important legislation will progress.  We will all put our backs behind it to make sure it is accelerated and becomes law.  I am aware that the Minister reviewed a number of aspects of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  Has she re-examined the various arguments made in the D&aacute;il by Labour Party Deputies and colleagues in the other parties to deal with if-and-when contracts?  If these rotten arrangements are not dealt with, they will become the weapon of choice for bad employers and that is the worry, even though there are thousands of good employers who work well with their employees.<\/p>  <p>  There are elements of the proposed legislation that are welcome and many of them were drawn from the proposals of my colleague, Senator Ged Nash, which he put forward to the Government in late 2015.  It seems that for most workers trapped on if-and-when contracts, their work will continue to be treated as casual.  This will deny them access to important provisions because they will not be classified as employees in the first place.  For example, if-and-when workers will not be able to request to be placed on an appropriate band of hours to better reflect the reality of the hours they work, as other workers can.  Has the Minister given any thought to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300029#BB00800","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1542087900,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Yes, we have given it loads of thought.  Each of the main elements of this Bill will improve the employment protections for people on if-and-when contracts.  The banded hours provision, for example, will apply to somebody on such a contract so that if they have worked an average number of hours over the previous 12-month reference period, they will be entitled to be placed on the band of hours that reflects the realities of those hours that have been worked.  The amendments to the terms of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 will require employers to inform their employees including those on if-and-when arrangements by the fifth day of commencing employment what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the working day and the working week to be.  Employers will also be required to state the expected duration of their contract and whether that contract is fixed or temporary.  Employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the new minimum compensation provisions.  Where they are given notice of hours of work but do not receive those hours, they will have to be given their two hours' compensation in lieu of the work they have not been given.  Finally, employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the anti-penalisation provisions in order that if an employer penalises them for exercising their rights under this Act, they will be entitled to pursue the matter through the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300029#BB00900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1542087900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>There is an urgent need for these provisions, giving hope and dignity to a cohort of workers who need to be brought in from the cold and given some hope for the future.  We in the Labour Party have certainly not changed our policy or views on if-and-when contracts.  My colleague, Senator Ged Nash, will table amendments to the legislation in the Seanad to address this problem.  Particularly, he will propose an amendment providing that where a period of employment has to be calculated, casual work should be included in the calculation if the casual worker was employed on a regular or systematic basis and if during the period of service the worker has a reasonable expectation of ongoing employment by the same employer.  That is important.  The law must have regard to the basic facts of working life such as whether the employee was offered work regularly, whether the employee generally accepted work when it was offered and whether there was a pattern or system to the work offered each week even if the amount of work offered might have varied .  Those are important components and indicia of a situation that should be comprehended and captured within the Bill.  That is the one amendment that I can signal already that Senator Nash will be proposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300029#BB01000","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1542087900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I have not seen the amendment but I have spoken to the Senator and I will disagree with what he is attempting to do.

I do not want to make life difficult for industry in carrying on its normal business but we will not tolerate a situation where people who are working on if-and-when contracts do not have the same employment protections as everybody else.  I am prepared to move a bit this way if Labour Party Members are prepared to move a bit that way.  I cannot countenance banning them even if all the Deputies and Senators gang up on me because there would be a significant backlash but perhaps we can try to achieve the same thing, which is to provide protections in law for the people who are currently working in those circumstances.

I do not think we have ever reached this number of questions.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with EU and OECD jurisdictions, reduced rates for young jobseekers were introduced from 2009 on a phased basis to tackle high youth unemployment.  These measures guard against the development of long-term welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme, he or she receives the maximum rate of jobseeker's allowance of &euro;198.  <\/p>  <p>  Age-related reduced rates do not apply to jobseekers with a qualified child, those transferring directly to jobseekers allowance from disability allowance and 18 to 24 year olds who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency during the 12 months before they reached 18 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  The youth employment support scheme, which I launched in September, is a work experience scheme for long-term unemployed jobseekers aged 18 to 24 or who face significant and particular employment barriers.  Participants will receive a minimum of &euro;229.20 per week or a weekly top-up of &euro;22.50 if they have dependants.  <\/p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment numbers on our live register, which is exceptionally welcome.  For example, the most recent data show that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to just under 12% in October 2018.  There has been a significant drop in the number of Irish youths who are unemployed.<\/p><p>Irish youth unemployment, which was at 23% in 2012, has fallen well below the EU average of 14.9%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300031#DD02400","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542089700,"counter":466,"content":"<p>While the drop in youth unemployment is welcome, it is not solely due to this measure.

That was changed, initially in 2009 by a Government which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il and of which I remember being a member.  I remember well the arguments to and fro and the rationale that was advanced, but it did not achieve what was forecast.  While in other countries, such as the UK, there was a differential between people of different ages, I do not think that the objectives were achieved, insofar as I can recall them being outlined during the debate around the Cabinet table.

We know there are many difficulties with getting into the system because there is ample evidence of the waiting lists.  There was always the feeling, however, that once one entered the Irish system, the treatment and care were excellent.  While that continues to be the case, there are growing exceptions.  Patients are in the system, but the understaffing and workload are so significant that it has a detrimental effect on the mental and physical health of both the staff and patients.  The working environment, therefore, is not as it should be.  Although I am speaking about the Mater Hospital, in particular, it applies to other hospitals also.<\/p>  <p>  On St. Vincent's ward, which is an oncology and haemotology ward at the Mater Hospital, the patients are very unwell and they need extensive nursing and medical input.  Consequently, the ratio of patient to nurse was historically 4:1.  Nowadays, the standard is 6:1, but there are many days when there is one staff nurse for 12 patients, with a student nurse from 1st, 2nd or 3rd year on the ward also.  It is difficult, therefore, to give the patients the care they need.  For that ward to have the staff it needs to provide that care, there should be six staff nurses and two managers daily.  In recent times, however, there have been four members of staff and one manager.<\/p>  <p>  The patients on the ward are there for chemotherapy or complications relating thereto.  They must experience a safe, effective delivery of chemotherapy and support with follow-up monitoring, which needs two nurses who are qualified and trained in safe chemotherapy administration practice on the ward at all times, according to the ward's policy and guidelines.  In the past two weeks, it was lucky to have one qualified chemotherapy-trained nurse, leading to inexperienced nurses administering chemotherapy or vital chemotherapy being delayed.  There has been some improvement in the numbers following meetings with the Workplace Relations Commission, the director of nursing and the union, but the issues leading to those problems are not being adequately addressed.  Rather, there is high staff turnover because of the stress involved in working on a ward with very ill patients who do not receive the recommended care from qualified staff.<\/p>  <p>  Experience counts for so much, which newly qualified and overseas nurses who do not have experience of Irish hospitals may lack.  Newly qualified nurses need the guidance of qualified staff in order that they will become experienced staff in time.  Nurses who are trained abroad are entering a system with which they are not familiar.  I am not undermining or demeaning in any way the newly qualified or immigrant nurses, but they need to be guided by the experienced staff in Ireland in order that there is a mix of skills.<\/p>  <p>  Nurses are under a great deal of stress.  On a recent Sunday, three nurses were on sick leave, two of whom were trained in safe chemotherapy administration, which left on the ward two nurses who had been qualified less than two years previously and who were not qualified to administer chemotherapy.  That is not acceptable for patients or nurses.<\/p>  <p>  It is disturbing that the information I present today is in a context of excellent facilities and treatment for cancer.  So many advances have been made and we know so much more about cancers and their treatment.  It was disappointing and alarming, therefore, to hear about the staff issues.  I know it is not confined to the Mater Hospital because I have information about other hospitals also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300032#EE00500","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1542089700,"counter":472,"content":"<p>As I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, I asked the Deputy whether she wished to withdraw the matter but she did not.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Mater Misercordiae University Hospital has experienced some difficulty in recruiting both permanent and temporary specialist oncology nurses for the oncology day unit in the hospital.  Due to a combination of resignation, sick leave and maternity leave, there were several vacancies.  The Minister was assured by the HSE that all avenues have been and are being explored to address the lack of oncology nurses.  As a result of these efforts, one nurse commenced induction yesterday and another will commence induction in December, after which all staff nurse vacancies will be filled.<\/p>  <p>  The Mater Hospital is working with the clinicians and nursing staff to reduce the impact on service delivery through redeployment of appropriately trained staff and the provision of additional raining.  The national cancer control programme has also supported the Mater Hospital in resourcing an additional oncologist who has been appointed and will commence in the new year.  The hospital continues to work closely with the Ireland East Hospital Group in conducting a review of its operational capacity as demand for oncology day services continues to rise.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, there are recruitment and retention difficulties in certain other areas of the health service, including nursing specialties.  In these instances, the HSE utilises a range of long-term measures such as overseas recruitment with agencies, rolling recruitment campaigns, recruitment fairs, social media recruitment campaigns and short-term measures such as staff reassignment to support service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE also continues to offer contracts to graduate nurses and midwives once they have obtained their registration from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI.  The Minister believes the recent pay proposals put forward by the Public Service Pay Commission were a positive step towards making the public health service a more attractive place to work for nurses and midwives.  The Government proposals made to address the issue of new entrants' pay will also benefit approximately 10,000 nurses to the value of approximately &euro;3,000 each.  The recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives has been a consistent priority for the Minister.  Challenges exist with recruitment and retention of these professions against a backdrop of shortages at a global level.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the challenges, the data show that the HSE has managed to increase the number of nurses and midwives employed.  When the number of nurses and midwives employed by the HSE is compared between September this year and last year, it shows that there was an increase of 1,050 whole-time equivalents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300032#EE00600","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1542090300,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I went ahead with this matter today because of its urgency.  I see there has been some progress.  I had heard that some nurses came into work while unwell rather than let down their patients and fellow staff but that is not good safe practice, especially considering the immune systems of people who have cancer.<\/p>  <p>  We know that nurses are a very skilled workforce, they have degrees in science, some have Masters degrees and other qualifications, and they have done a great deal of work and study to become registered.  They want to deliver the service for which they have been trained and give the best care to their patients.  For cancer patients, it is about giving them every chance to recover and live their lives.<\/p>  <p>  I know St. James's Hospital and the pressures on their services well.  I know from someone who is currently receiving treatment there that it begins at 8 a.m. and the nurses see dozens of patients daily.  The first tranche is at 8 a.m. and the next is at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m.  Not all of these people are receiving chemotherapy, some are getting injections or hormone infusions and blood.  There are 12 beds in the ward, and as soon as the treatment of one patient is finished, the next is called.  The nurses and doctors are run off their feet from 7.30 a.m. until late at night.  It can be after 8 p.m. before they finish.  I am sure that like me, the Minister of State has had family and friends with cancer who have gone through our system, facing the illness.  The treatment and the effects that go with it are very difficult but we have good success and recovery rates.  Cancer is not the death sentence it once was.  However, we need the qualified and the experienced nursing staff to work alongside the newly qualified because the experienced staff can bring their new colleagues along.<\/p>  <p>  We know that the problem is the overall pay and conditions, with the cost of living including housing that has resulted in our very well-trained nurses travelling to other countries.

They want to know why the new ambulance service which was based in Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim has been moved to Boyle in County Roscommon.  They want to know when the new measures which were promised by the HSE about new personnel, ambulances and first responder schemes will be put in place in Leitrim as advised in the 2015 capacity review of the national ambulance service.<\/p>  <p>  As an elected representative for the County Leitrim area of the constituency, I also want to understand the problems and to help to identify what has gone wrong with ambulance waiting times in the county.  I want to know what is being done by the HSE management to try to improve response times in the county and when the national ambulance service will be returned to its new base in Carrick-on-Shannon to cover the southern part of the county.<\/p>  <p>  There is much concern on the ground about this as there have been several shocking cases where people have been left waiting for hours for an ambulance.  In January this year in Ballinamore, a woman aged 85 years who had fallen and broken her leg had to endure a two and a half hour wait for an ambulance.  In June, another elderly lady in Ballinamore had to wait for almost five hours.  An ambulance was first called at 2.50 p.m. but did not arrive at her home in south Leitrim until almost 7 p.m.  The woman was eventually brought to Cavan hospital which is only a 40 minute drive from her home, and had surgery a few hours later.<\/p>  <p>  These are shocking examples of what is going on across the county under the current service.  I have done some research on the issue and have been advised in a written parliamentary question, according to the assistant chief ambulance officer, Mr. Oliver Reilly, that County Leitrim only ever had two ambulance rosters on duty, one during the day and a night shift.  One is based in Manorhamilton while another was set to be based in Carrick-on-Shannon but, as I noted earlier, is now based in Boyle in County Roscommon where it will remain for the foreseeable future.  It is alarming that only one ambulance is ever on call in the whole county.  In effect, one ambulance is often not available as under the current system, ambulances must often attend emergencies in other rural parts of the county.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister believe this is sufficient ambulance cover for a widespread rural area in which few community first responder units have yet been established?

The national ambulance service operates from two locations in Leitrim, namely Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton.  However, services in Leitrim are not exclusively provided by staff based at these Leitrim stations.  This is because the national ambulance service is increasingly moving to a policy of dynamic deployment.  This ensures that vehicles are strategically located where they are most likely to be required, rather than located at a particular station.  In line with this policy, and using the advanced medical priority dispatch system to triage calls, Leitrim is supported by other national ambulance service ambulance bases in Boyle, Sligo, Loughglynn, Cavan, Roscommon and Longford.  Several developments have been made by the national ambulance service in order to address the issue of response times and ambulance cover in Leitrim.<\/p>  <p>  I know too that in Border counties the national ambulance service works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in order to provide a more responsive service for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity review, published in 2016, identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas such as Leitrim.  The capacity review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responder, CFR, schemes.  The national ambulance service continues to work with local CFR groups across the region to enhance services.<\/p>  <p>  The national ambulance service has undergone a very significant process of modernisation in recent years and there have been important service innovations and developments.  This ambulance reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services, which was published in late 2014, and the national ambulance service capacity review.<\/p>  <p>  The National Emergency Operations Centre has been established, where emergency calls are received and emergency resources are dispatched.  The national ambulance service has visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.  In addition, the national ambulance service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, which frees up emergency ambulances for the more urgent calls.<\/p><p>A permanent emergency aeromedical support service has also been established to provide a more timely response to persons in rural communities.<\/p> <p> During recent years additional investment has been directed towards the national ambulance service.  This year, an additional sum of &euro;10.7 million has been made available, which includes &euro;2.75 million to fund new developments.  New developments include the development of alternative pathways to care with the Hear and Treat clinical hub that went live in the national emergency operations centre in March of this year.  This diverts some lower acuity patients to alternative care pathways and frees up some emergency capacity.  It is anticipated that such initiatives will help to improve response times around the country, including in the Leitrim area.  I will come back to the Deputy on other issues he raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300033#FF00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542090900,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and I have a few queries on foot of it.  A capacity review into the national ambulance service was conducted in 2015 and its findings were released in 2016.  It found that in order for the service to meet strict HIQA standards, additional staff needed to be hired.  Can the Minister of State identify the Government's efforts in that regard and indicate the progress that has been made to date in providing new staff and ambulances for the service? I note the capacity review outlined the case for working with community first responders in rural areas in County Leitrim.  They are generally the local GPs who are under considerable pressure, working in large rural areas on their own and they have very busy surgeries without adequate back-up and support.  What efforts are in hand to improve matters?<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to come to Leitrim to meet the local doctors to hear at first hand their genuine fears for their patients, namely, the prospect that they face the worst outcome as a result of longer than acceptable response times.<\/p>  <p>  As per the commitment given by the national ambulance service, will she agree to facilitate a meeting with the management of the north west ambulance service to enable its members to outline their efforts to increase resources in the area, place more than just one ambulance in the new base in Carrick-on-Shannon to serve the people of south Leitrim and west Cavan and reduce waiting times to under one hour?<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised this evening that the Boyle ambulance crew has filed a health and safety complaint regarding the deployment of the second ambulance from Carrick-on-Shannon to their base, thus prompting serious concern that only one crew from Carrick-on-Shannon will be moved and that the crew currently based there will be moved to Sligo, leaving no ambulance service for Leitrim in the county.

As a result, they are entitled to fewer benefits such as sick pay, overtime, increments, pension contributions, maternity leave and holiday pay.<\/p><p>Department officials attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection last week to discuss the issue of bogus self-employment.  I was dismayed to learn the Department does not keep any records on bogus self-employment, despite carrying out inspections to supposedly identify it.  Despite keeping no records of cases of bogus self-employment, the Department believes from some reports it cites that the issue of bogus self-employment is not significant or prevalent in the State.  That is in stark contrast to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for example, which has estimated that over an eight-year period the State may have missed out on &euro;640 million in unpaid PRSI due to bogus self-employment in the construction industry alone.<\/p><p>  The newly-formed Connect trade union, which represents 40,000 craft workers, has estimated the practice is costing the State &euro;300 million a year.  Bogus self-employment is prevalent not only in the construction industry but in other sectors.<\/p><p>  The Eversheds Sutherland report highlights significant difficulties and inconsistencies in employment practices at RT&Eacute;.  The Unite union has highlighted the problem faced by workers in the English language teaching sector.  I understand there may be some employees - or they are not employees in the correct sense, - in this establishment who are suffering from bogus self-employment practice.  The Minister needs to investigate that and come back to us on it.<\/p><p>  With the increase in the prevalence of fast food, delivery services are becoming a major issue in this regard.  Does the Minister have any intention of introducing measures to combat this problem, which is costing the State significantly in lost tax revenue and leaving thousands of workers vulnerable in their employment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300034#GG00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1542090900,"counter":484,"content":"<p>The practice of bogus self-employment and employers forcing workers on to self-employed contracts when they should be employees is, unfortunately, on the increase.  According to the Connect trade union, which organises more than 40,000 tradespeople, it is now rampant in the construction industry.  We also see it in the media and film industries, particularly in RT&Eacute;, and in many other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions calculates that the loss to the Exchequer is approximately &euro;80 million per year and amounts to &euro;680 million since 2007.  With all this in mind, it is baffling that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection keeps no records in cases of bogus self-employment, despite carrying out inspections to apparently identify the problem.  The Department cites that in 2017 it carried out 2,698 employer reviews with savings of &euro;2.27 million recorded, which we welcome, but it could not tell the joint committee the number of these reviews which resulted in bogus-self employment being identified.  We have a bizarre situation where inspections are being carried out, yet no data are being kept on the level of bogus self-employment found.  That begs the question as to why the Department would even bother carrying out the inspections in the first place.  Despite keeping no records of bogus self-employment, the Department believes in some reports it cites that bogus self-employment is not significant or prevalent.  This shows a very lax attitude on behalf of the Department to the issue of bogus self-employment and no real intention of tackling it.  While on the one hand the Department is happy to put pressure on ordinary citizens to recoup money where it makes a mistake and an overpayment is made, and the Government was happy to roll out a campaign on so-called welfare cheats which itself turned out to be bogus, it does not show the same urgency when it comes to employers using this practice.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has said time and again that this is not an issue, yet it is not collecting the data to demonstrate how serious an issue this is.  That is a failing on behalf of the Government and I want to know how that will be rectified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300034#GG00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1542091500,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  False self-employment is consistently brought up by Deputies as a prevalent issue.  If any Deputy is aware of any particular cases, the Minister strongly urges them to bring these to attention of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure they can be investigated.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s scope section makes in excess of 1,000 employment status determinations each year covering a range of issues including directors of companies, family employments, partnerships and public sector employments.  The number of cases involving a direct conflict of employment or self-employment status is relatively small.  In 2017, the scope section made 138 decisions resulting in a class A employment decision.  Of these, 35 could be described as disputed employment\/self-employment cases.  In the current year, the section has made 113 decisions resulting in a class A employment decision of which 27 could be described as disputed employment\/self-employment cases.<\/p>  <p>  Following a scope section decision, the employer will be liable for class A PRSI for the full period of employment.  This can be a significant penalty for a business.  Most employers co-operate fully with the Department&rsquo;s inspectors in insuring compliance following a scope decision.  Where they fail to comply, additional measures, including prosecution, can be brought to bear.  Cases referred to the Department&rsquo;s central prosecution service, CPS, for consideration of prosecution are examined using the principles established by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.<\/p>  <p>  Employer-specific social welfare offences have been considered by the courts as being of a technical nature in that they relate to a failure to keep and maintain prescribed records and remit PRSI.  If, during the proceedings, the employer remits the PRSI or provides the records that were requested, the case is commonly withdrawn or struck out.  The Department will generally only pursue a case where the employer refuses to comply.<\/p>  <p>  The Department carried out a media campaign on false self-employment in May 2018 to ensure better public awareness of the important service the Department provides in determining employment status, as well as to help develop a better understanding of the scale and nature of false self-employment.  The scope section received 50 calls and 30 emails during the campaign from individuals who had become aware of the service directly as a result of the advertisement campaign.  Up to 15 scope section investigations were created as a direct result of the media campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Given the relatively low number of formal requests for determinations, there may be some reluctance by individuals to seek a scope section determination due to concerns over how an employer will react.  This suggests that the most appropriate way to address the issue will be through inspection.  Anti-victimisation measures may be required to provide assurance to workers that they cannot be victimised if they raise legitimate concerns regarding their employment status.<\/p>  <p>  Although the response was low, the response to the campaign will inform the inspection work of the Department, Revenue and the WRC, including in sectors other than construction.  The Department has intensified its employer inspection activity since the campaign.  A separate series of investigations took place in the west focused on the construction sector.  Two further projects with a particular emphasis on identifying false self-employment are planned for the Dublin north and mid-west divisions.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to identify hard data on false self-employment without individuals coming forward for investigation and decision.  While there are some cases of false self-employment in particular sectors, this has not translated into any increase in overall levels of self-employment as might be expected if there was a growing problem.  The self-employed continue to make up just over 15% of total employment.  This is in line with the average rate of self-employment in the EU and has not increased in the past 16 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300035#HH00100","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1542091500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.

Several issues have arisen, however, in how the State's procurement process has been implemented.  Ireland is a small open economy and has vulnerabilities that other European countries do not have.  The size and scale of our economy has put Irish contractors at a distinct disadvantage in the process.<\/p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that a product supplied by a company, which was successful in winning the tender to supply the Garda training college in Templemore, County Tipperary, does not match the normal standards for food labelling.  The contract was won at the expense of a local producer who had supplied the college for many years.  The product in question is a roasted coffee product.  The following issues have been presented to me which are of serious concern.<\/p>  <p>  The product is branded to suggest that it is from a company registered in Ireland.  However, there is no such company registered in Ireland, despite the packaging implying so.  The packaging implies that the product is roasted in a specific town in Ireland.  I can emphatically state that there is no coffee roasterie in that town.  There is a minimum of three different types of coffee making up this product but the packaging does not state this.  There is no labelling as to the origin of these coffees.  A high percentage of the coffee from the sample pack tested was damaged, under-roasted and of low quality and consistency.  A list of ingredients is not labelled on the sample pack examined.  This is one product from one supplier.  I am offering the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, evidence that normal standards of food labelling and safety have not been adhered to.<\/p><p>This raises serious concern about the effectiveness of the State's procurement process and demands that the particular incident be properly investigated.  On this evidence alone, it is clear the process is completely unable to guarantee the same standard of food which local companies supplied for generations.<\/p> <p> I have raised this issue on at least four occasions over the past two years and it is now a matter of urgency that we see real change in the national procurement process.  No account is made in the tendering process for the local supplier with generations of experience in the supply of quality, safe foods to the public sector.  I can also quote a furniture company, an office stationery company and a building company in my home town of Thurles which have been frozen out from supplying the public sector.  They offer well-paid sustainable jobs in our communities and can match price and service, yet the Government says \"No thanks\".  The Government believes some big international supplier can do better than our indigenous companies but it is wrong.  These big international suppliers cannot do it better than our own local Irish suppliers.  In this case, the big international companies are supplying a substandard product with very questionable labelling.  I remind the Minister of State that this is a food product that we are talking about.  In this case alone, the State's procurement process has got it terribly wrong.  No one can be expected to believe this is an isolated incident.  With the hundreds of thousands of products being supplied to the public sector daily, there is every chance that this is not the only low-quality product being provided.  I argue that the business model of these international suppliers involves replacing quality products with cheaper substitutes to secure contracts.  The Government is being penny-wise and pound-foolish.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State formally today to begin a root and branch review of the process and to put at its heart quality of product and service throughout the tender process.  I ask the Government to show some support for our local companies and to stop hiding behind EU regulations.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for carrying on and managing the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister has no direct role in the management of the finances of the Garda College in Templemore.  It is important to note that the Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and that expenditure in relation to the Garda College and the procurement procedures operated at the college are primarily his responsibility.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal audit report on financial procedures in the Garda College, which was completed in February 2017, raised serious issues in relation to governance and accountability in the college.  Oversight of the implementation of the recommendations of that report was referred to the Policing Authority by the Minister's predecessor in March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  One of issues of concern highlighted by the report was that the manner in which goods and services for the college were procured was not in accordance with public procurement legislation.  The Commissioner accepted the findings set out in the report and put in place arrangements to ensure that its recommendations were implemented.  The Commissioner has advised that, upon a request from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of Government Procurement issued a request for tenders on 16 November 2017 via the eTenders procurement portal to establish a single supplier framework for the provision of goods to the college.  To encourage small businesses to bid for this contract, the competition was divided into 13 product lots.  The Minister is further informed that the request for tender for the food contracts for the Garda College restaurant clearly outlined that all labelling of the goods must comply with national and European food labelling requirements.  The tender also included requirements in relation to HACCP and food safety compliance.  The Minister is advised that the procurement process is complete and that contracts have been awarded to the successful tenderers.<\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority has assessed the action taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the recommendation in the audit report dealing with procurement at the Garda College and has deemed it completed.

The fact of the matter is that small local companies are being frozen out.  Templemore is just one example of what is, unfortunately, happening in the vast majority of tendering processes nationally.  I can set out other examples besides the issue with the quality of the coffee which I cited in my opening statement.  The quality of products being sourced is not up to the standard that obtained previously in the depot.  There were 14 or 15 local companies supplying products to the depot previously and they provided valuable local employment which was essential to the local economy.  All bar one lost out in this procurement process, however.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen the tender process that was forced on these small companies.  It was not possible for small companies to do what the procurement process demanded.  It was extremely expensive and required the expenditure of a great deal of money in a lot of cases.  Questions were also asked of suppliers which it was unreasonable to expect them to respond to.  No small company could deal with them.  One example relates to a local fruit company which had been supplying the depot for over 30 years and was asked what it would do in the event of a storm and about its capacity to source product.  During the storm event which took place a couple of months ago, however, it was ironic to find the depot having to turn back to local suppliers to source supplies for the students and employees of the college.  The procurement process which has been put in place renders it impossible for small local companies to win contracts.<\/p>  <p>  I make the following point forcefully to the Minister of State.  We now have proof that the product being supplied to one particular State institution is of an inferior quality by comparison to what was supplied previously.

As has been stated, it is technical in nature, with the main aim of including palladium and mixed precious metals on the list of precious metals which may be hallmarked by the Irish Assay Office.  On foot of the Bill being brought forward, I was kindly invited to and subsequently visited the assay office in October of last year to better inform myself about the process of hallmarking and the changes the Bill was seeking to bring about.  I wish to thank John Harbourne and Robert White who invited us to the office, showed us around and explained in great detail the impressive history and operations of the assay office which dates back to 1637.  I was very impressed by the set-up of the office in Dublin Castle and the expertise of its staff.  Similar to most people, I had limited knowledge of hallmarking, but the visit made me acutely aware of its significance.  The assay office is a very impressive and effective organisation staffed by people who have a deep desire to ensure customers are protected and Irish jewellery retains its extremely high reputation for quality.  I was encouraged to see that it is exploring opportunities arising from Brexit and the potential benefits for Ireland and our hallmarking institutions.  Hallmarking is a very niche process and I was delighted to have the opportunity to better understand its history, system and importance.<\/p>  <p>  Members were probably contacted by jewellers' representatives groups on the Bill.  Most were happy with the provisions of the Bill, but some wanted weight exemptions included.  After carrying out research and consulting with the representative bodies, we concluded that no amendments for weight exemptions should be introduced in order to ensure the high quality of Irish products is maintained and to protect consumers.  We were happy to support the Bill in its original format and will similarly support its amended form.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and thank the staff of the assay office for their important work in this area.  The Irish Assay Office has been in operation for the past 381 years.  I hope the changes contained in the Bill will help to protect the high quality of Irish jewellery for years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300037#KK01900","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1542092700,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their engagement on the Bill which aims to enhance consumer protection and strengthen consumer confidence regarding the proper hallmarking of articles of jewellery made from precious metal.

The bank was founded in 1963 and the fund established in 1972 with membership consisting of 54 African states and 26 non-African states.  The group&rsquo;s mission is to help reduce poverty, improve living conditions and mobilise resources for the continent&rsquo;s economic and social development.<\/p><p>To achieve this, the bank group mobilises and allocates resources for investment in its regional member countries and provides policy advice and technical assistance to support development efforts.  This Bill will facilitate the approval of the agreement establishing the African Development Bank and the agreement establishing the African Development Fund and facilitate payments to be made to the bank and the fund, respectively.<\/p> <p> Following the approval of the Government in November 2017, the Department of Finance has been engaging with the bank secretariat regarding Ireland's potential membership.  Formal notification of Ireland's interest in participating in the fund and being admitted as a member of the bank was sent to the current president of the bank, Mr. Adesina, in February of this year.  If Ireland is to complete its membership of the bank and the fund, we are required to consent to be bound by the international agreements establishing the bank and the fund.  Membership shall oblige Ireland to contribute to both the bank and the fund.  As Deputies will be aware, Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution provides that \"the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\".  The enactment of the Bill before the House would confirm such approval.  Similar requirements applied when Ireland joined other international financial institutions such as the World Bank and, most recently, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank last year.<\/p> <p> The rationale for Ireland's membership of the bank and the fund is primarily based on the bank's alignment with Ireland's development priorities, as well our trade relations with the wider African economy.  In particular, the bank&rsquo;s emphasis on climate change, agriculture and nutrition, fragile states and jobs and economic development align closely with four of the six priority areas for action identified in Ireland's current international development policy.  Historically, Ireland has had a long and positive relationship with Africa.  Strong links were built through the development work of missionaries and aid workers and the effectiveness of our aid programme.  Our reputation has been enhanced by the positive contribution of our peacekeepers, diplomats and business people.  Our decision to join the bank and the fund complements our existing development relationship and is consistent with the priorities set out in the Global Ireland 2025 initiative, which was launched recently.  I refer, for example, to our ambition to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint across the next seven years.  This initiative relates specifically to the objective of extending our influence in Asia and Africa.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is in the process of developing a new international development policy to take account of the significantly evolving international development context.  In light of the increasing interconnectedness and scale of the international agenda, the co-ordination of efforts and the combining of resources will be increasingly important.  Our partnership with multilateral institutions like the African Development Bank Group will be a key part of our approach.  Ireland's membership of the bank and the fund is consistent with our commitment to the UN 2030 agenda for sustainable development and is reflective of our whole-of-government approach to implementing the sustainable development goals.  While the overarching rationale for our membership of the bank and the fund is based on values, our membership will also create new opportunities for Irish business.  When we join the bank and the fund, our enterprises will be able to tender for the delivery of services or products for bank and fund projects which were not previously available to them.  While the return from such access is difficult to quantify given the size of the operations of the bank and the fund in predominantly emerging economies, the potential for such new markets is timely and welcome.<\/p> <p> The operations of the African Development Bank Group are underpinned by its corporate strategy.  The African Development Bank's strategy for 2013 to 2022 is firmly rooted in a deep understanding of the process of economic transformation which Africa has embarked on in recent decades.  It focuses on two objectives: improving the quality of Africa's growth and facilitating inclusive growth and the transition to green growth.  The delivery of this work is to be achieved through five channels: infrastructure development, regional economic integration, private sector development, governance and accountability, and skills and technology.  The authorised capital stock of the bank is approximately &euro;79 billion, with approximately &euro;6 billion of paid-in capital.  In addition to subscriptions from member countries, the African Development Bank, like other multilateral development banks, raises capital on international markets at competitive rates by maintaining its AAA rating.<\/p> <p> The African Development Group has 80 member countries, comprising 54 regional member countries and 26 non-regional member countries.  Most of the countries in the latter group are in Europe, America and Asia.  Among the European countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  Non-regional member countries account for approximately 2.65 million of the total shares within the bank, representing 40.9% of the total shares and 40.9% of the total voting power.  Of the non-regional countries, the US is the largest shareholder, occupying 6.6% of the total voting power.  Based on the terms offered by the bank, it is intended that Ireland will acquire 53,620 shares, which is equivalent to 0.799% of the bank's total shareholding.  This is in line with the shareholdings held by Belgium and the Netherlands, which hold 0.65% and 0.8% of the total shareholding, respectively.  Each member country at the bank is represented at the bank's board of governors, which is the bank&rsquo;s highest decision-making body.  As part of a system that mirrors the position at each of the other international financial institutions of which Ireland is already a member, the Minister for Finance would be the governor for Ireland at the bank.  The Department of Finance would manage Ireland's shareholding and representation at the bank, which replicates the position at all other international financial institutions, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.<\/p> <p> The board of governors meets formally once a year for the bank's annual meeting.  This board is responsible for electing the president of the bank, who is elected for a five-year term which can be renewed once.  The current president is Mr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is a former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in Nigeria.  He was elected as the eighth president of the bank in May 2015.  The bank's board of directors, which is responsible for the bank's general operations, comprises 20 members who are neither governors nor alternate governors.  Thirteen members are elected by the governors of regional countries and seven members are elected by the governors of non-regional member countries.  Directors are elected for terms of five years which can be renewed once.  The non-regional representation at board level is broken up into seven constituencies, four of which are led by EU member countries.  Negotiations regarding the constituency which Ireland will join following membership are ongoing.<\/p> <p> The operations of the African Development Bank Group are wide-ranging.  The bank finances projects and programmes in areas like agriculture, health, education, public utilities, transport and telecommunications and the private sector.  The bank also finances non-project operations, including structural adjustment loans, policy-based reforms and various forms of technical assistance.  In 2017, total disbursements for the bank group peaked at approximately &euro;6.6 billion, with project approvals amounting to approximately &euro;7.5 billion across 249 operations.  With regard to performance, the success of the bank group in delivering results for Africa has been recognised by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network, which is a network of like-minded donor countries that monitors the performance of multilateral development organisations and of which Ireland is a member.  A recent assessment from the network, which was conducted in 2016, concluded that \"the Bank is a robust and resilient organisation that, while operating in a particularly difficult environment, is able to continually adjust and improve to meet the changing conditions\".  It is of particular note that the assessment highlighted that the bank is particularly strong in the area of safeguards and standards, which facilitates the delivery of social and environmental standards, as well as in the area of screening projects against gender and climate change criteria.  While the bank is an independent institution, it has a close working relationship with other multilateral development institutions such as the World Bank, specifically in the area of co-financing.  In 2017, co-financing investments from partners such as the World Bank and the European Investment Bank generated approximately &euro;9 billion.<\/p> <p> Subject to the enactment of this Bill and the completion of our application for membership, Ireland will acquire 53,620 shares, which is equivalent to 0.799% of the bank's total shareholding.<\/p><p>In capital terms, this equates to a capital allocation in the order of &euro;630 million, of which approximately &euro;37.8 million represents paid-in capital, with the remainder of the allocation, &euro;592.2 million comprising callable capital.  In general callable capital represents the capital which a member country would be liable for if the institution encountered acute financial distress, while paid-in capital is the amount which a member contributes under normal circumstances.  Based on Ireland's membership of existing international financial institutions, the probability of the callable capital being called upon is negligible.  Therefore, in practice, our proposed shareholding equates to a subscription of approximately &euro;37.8 million, payable over eight years at &euro;4.7 million annually.  With regard to our participation in the fund which is a prerequisite to facilitate our membership of the bank as a non-regional member country, a subscription of approximately &euro;62 million will be required, with payments to be encashed in up to eight annual instalments.  This is in line with our pledges to similar funds at the World Bank and the International Development Association.<\/p> <p> Combined, the expected cost of Ireland's membership of the bank and fund would be approximately &euro;99.8 million, payable over eight years at approximately &euro;12.4 million per annum, depending on prevailing exchange rates.  As is the case with our membership of other international financial institutions, Ireland's contributions to the bank and the fund would be sourced from the central fund, with payments to be provided for in the legislation.  Furthermore, in the context of our continued efforts to achieve the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, for overseas development assistance, ODA, Ireland's contributions to the bank and fund provide a further channel to effectively deliver increased levels of ODA.  Moreover, the consistent level of payments over an eight year period would avoid perceptions of volatility or periodic reductions in Ireland's annual ODA contribution.<\/p> <p> I now turn to the specific provisions of the six sections of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with the Short Title of the Bill, section 2 sets out the definitions used in the Bill and section 3 provides for the approval of the agreement establishing the bank, thereby enabling the State to be party to the agreement.  The agreement establishing the bank is attached as a Schedule to the Bill.  Section 4 makes provision for payments and receipts under the terms of the agreement establishing the bank.  Section 5 provides for the approval of the agreement establishing the fund, thereby enabling the State to be party to the agreement.  The agreement establishing the fund is attached as a Schedule to the Bill.  Section 6 makes provision for payments and receipts under the terms of the agreement establishing the fund.<\/p> <p> I also would like to bring to the attention of Deputies that, subject to Government approval, a number of amendments to the Bill may be introduced on Committee Stage, and, of course, any suggestions put forward by Deputies will also be considered by the Minister.  I strongly recommend Ireland's membership of the bank and fund.  The bank and fund play a significantly important role in driving economic and social development in Africa, and hence our membership would strengthen our existing development relationship in the region.  Additionally, our membership would be consistent with the priorities set out in the recently launched Global Ireland 2025 initiative notably the ambition to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint over the next seven years, and with regard to the objective of extending our influence in Africa.  In that context Ireland's participation in the bank provides an opportunity to extend our reach and impact in terms of trade, in particular through enhancing opportunities for Irish companies to secure procurements.  The membership of the bank and fund would also provide a further channel to effectively deliver increased levels of ODA.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300037#KK02800","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542093900,"counter":534,"content":"<p>This is a very important Bill.

We are already a member of several international development banks, including the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Council of Europe Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and, most recently, through the legislation passed in this House, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  The decision to become a member of the African Development Bank and fund is in line with those commitments.<\/p>  <p>  It is an opportune time to acknowledge the incredible work of many Irish missionaries in Africa down the years and which continues to this day.  The selfless dedication and work of many members of different religious orders from Ireland over many years in Africa has been quite astounding.  It is important to acknowledge that and express our thanks for that work.<\/p>  <p>  The fact the African Development Bank emphasises issues such as climate change, agriculture and nutrition, fragile states, economic development and job creation makes it worthy of support.  Our shareholding will be modest, coming in at just under 0.8% of the overall share profile of the bank.  We will be one of a growing number of European countries which will be members of the bank and fund.  It is important that the objectives of the bank and the fund are consistent with the sustainable development goals we have signed up to through various international commitments.  It is important that Ireland's voice and that of the European Union are heard positively ensuring that the sustainable development agenda is to the fore when the board of directors of the bank make decisions on where to invest funds and what types of project to invest in.  <\/p>  <p>  The terms of the Bill are straightforward.  We will participate fully on Committee Stage in the analysis of the Bill to make sure it achieves the objectives as set out.  There is a trade dimension to Ireland's business relationship with Africa.  It is a growing relationship as Irish businesses look to diversify their presence in different markets, not least against the backdrop of Brexit, which remains uncertain, although we welcome reports of an agreed text between the EU and the UK negotiating teams in recent hours.  There are, however, several hurdles to be crossed before there is a workable agreement that avoids the type of disruption we do not want to see affecting the Irish, UK and European economies.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, according to information provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, the total value of Irish exports to Africa was &euro;1.42 billion, with imports to Ireland worth &euro;601.3 million.  The main export markets in Africa for Ireland are first, Nigeria, worth &euro;280 million, second, South Africa, worth &euro;243 million, and then Egypt, Morocco and Algeria.<\/p><p>There will be further opportunities.  Reputationally, Ireland's membership of and participation in this bank and the African Development Fund will enhance the opportunities available to Irish firms to develop trade links further in the period ahead.  That is very welcome.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State is saying that, in respect of additional calls of capital that may be required, the prospect of the estimated &euro;600 million ever being called in is negligible.  He used the term \"negligible\".  It is important, of course, that we assess properly the likelihood of this and make sure we are protected by way of our Exchequer contribution.  This bank  will operate very much in a similar way to the other international development banks to which Ireland is currently party.  Our Minister will be a governor of the bank and will attend the AGM once a year.  Ireland will be participating, presumably on a rotational basis, as part of a constituency of non-African member states to share the director role.  As a result, there will at some point be an Irish director for three years, renewable for one term.  I am sure the Government will seek to ensure we have representation that is proportionate to the contribution and commitment we are making to this initiative.<\/p> <p> The contribution we are making is reckonable in terms of Ireland's ODA commitments.  There is an arguable case in either direction on that front because it is not ODA in the traditional sense, but I acknowledge the work of this bank can contribute very significantly to economic development within Africa.  This, of course, is a goal of the Government.  The definition of ODA is evolving.  We have to continue to examine ways of expanding our influence in favour of the type of model we believe works and will work in Africa, such that countries there can continue to explore opportunities to develop their economies and build trade links with other countries, taking account of the vast size of the continent and its diversity along so many metrics.<\/p> <p> I will not elaborate beyond that.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports this legislation.  It is a demonstration of Ireland's commitment to participating in organisations internationally that focus on development, particularly sustainable development.  We need to ensure that agenda is pursued in the operational decisions made by the bank.  We are making a modest financial commitment up-front but it is an important one.  It will enhance Ireland's reputation and its presence on the continent of Africa.  It will open doors and create opportunities for further business and trade links to be developed, which is in the common interest of Africa, Ireland and the wider European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300039#MM00200","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542094500,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.

It is right and proper that we participate in development banks that make a contribution to the development of the entire world.  As we know, Africa is a continent that is desperately short of key infrastructure, such as roads, rail networks and power plants.  It is important that any efforts to tackle this infrastructural gap be African led and managed and part of a sustainable development plan.<\/p>  <p>  ODA, was once widely viewed as humanitarian assistance or a simple cash transfer.  It is important to note that for what European countries give out in ODA, they take back multiples from African countries by means of unfair trade systems, the dumping of goods and, in particular, tax-avoidance schemes.  Throughout Europe's brutal colonial occupation of most of the African continent, the latter was robbed of its natural resources, minerals and people.  Some of the structures that were in place at the time remain in place today.  We must bear that in mind before congratulating ourselves too much today in taking the decision to join this bank.  While the AIIB was a new bank, driven by China, the African Development Fund and African Development Bank are long established and African led.  Ireland is late in the day joining up as a member but it is better late than never.  Unlike the case of the AIIB, there is no disadvantage to not being a founding member.<\/p>  <p>  While in the grand scheme of things Ireland's contribution is small, both from the perspective of our budget and the budget of the bank, it is nevertheless &euro;62 million or thereabouts, to be encashed in eight annual instalments and amounting to approximately &euro;8 million per annum, for participation in the fund.  There is a paid-in contribution in the region of &euro;37.8 million for membership of the bank, which is also payable over eight years and amounts to &euro;4.7 million annually.  The first instalment is to be paid when the Oireachtas passes this Bill.  This Bill therefore deserves our full attention and proper scrutiny.  This means insisting that there provision is made for accountability in order that the Oireachtas will not simply be writing a blank cheque.  After all, I understand the maximum callable capital under the agreement would amount to just less than &euro;600 million in Ireland's case.  I fully accept that this is highly unlikely to ever be called because it never has been.  It is important, however, to err on the side of caution.  With that in mind, I will consider for Committee Stage amendments to ensure accountability and transparency will be central to the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Bill stipulating that the annual report of the fund or bank be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is just a small example.  I note that any moneys, including amendments, must be approved by the D&aacute;il and not just the Minister for Finance.  This is welcome.  It has not always been the case, and that is why I make the point.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Finance (Certain European Union and lntergovernmental Obligations) Act, which was originally entitled the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill 2016, Sinn F&eacute;in made the point, accepted through an amendment, that when we sign off on these international agreements it is not good enough to have the D&aacute;il sign off once and then have changes to what we agreed without further approval.  That is not in this legislation, which is to be welcomed.  At first glance, the legislation seems tighter but I will examine it and propose further amendments, if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The other major issue for me is how we account for the money.  This was touched upon in terms of our ODA.  The Minister told my colleague Deputy Crowe that the OECD Development Assistance Committee has decreed that 85% of contributions to the AIIB are eligible to be recorded as ODA.  Could the Minister of State clarify what percentage of the African Development Bank payment could be counted towards our ODA target?  I hope the moneys will go towards development but Ireland, as an investor rather than a donor, should not be counting the full cost as ODA.<\/p><p>That would amount to cooking the books to inflate our ODA payments.<br\/><br\/>We still have a journey ahead of us to meet our ODA obligations.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence indicates that &quot;for Ireland to reach the 0.7% target by 2030, the overall aid programme needs to grow from &euro;707 million (currently) to &euro;2.5 billion, or an increase of &euro;150 million per annum over the period (an increase of close to &euro;1.8 billion).&quot;  Budget 2019, announced on 9 October, provides an additional &euro;110 million for 2019 so we are already falling short in respect of what our trajectory should be.  We must recall how grossly distorted the State's GDP is but also that there are times, such as when meeting our fiscal targets, that it plays to our advantage.  Either way, we must accept we are a long way from reaching our ODA obligations.  There has to be a clear trajectory and roadmap from the Government on how it proposes to do this.  It should be hived off from the budgetary process in order to make it clear internationally that we stand by our commitments and intend to meet them.<br\/><br\/>We should not end this debate when the Bill is passed..  It is vital that the system relating to ODA is accountable and transparent.  Ultimately, this is taxpayers' money and there must be constant oversight of how it is paid, to ensure that when it is paid it is making a meaningful difference to the lives of people in the regions for which it is intended.  As part of that, the T&aacute;naiste should attend before the finance committee annually to discuss the Department of Finance's ODA spend so that we can hear more about how it is being spent and the impact it is generating.  The joint committee regularly meets the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to discuss the ODA spent by his Department.  The finance committee should do likewise.  What is the Minister of State's view on that?<br\/><br\/>When it announced the decision to take part in this development bank the Department of Finance told us that it was &quot;an opportunity to extend Ireland's reach and impact in terms of trade, in particular through enhancing opportunities for Irish companies to secure project contracts&quot;.  That may be true but the Department might have led with the fact that it would allow us to aid the development of the continent of Africa in conjunction with the people who live there.  Undoubtedly, there are many positives for trade and Irish businesses, but this is a worthwhile decision in its own right purely based on the merits of what the development bank and fund does.  That is why, first and foremost, I am supporting this legislation.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned the need for transparency and accountability.  As with the AIIB, the agreement before us could much stronger ar an timpeallacht agus ar chearta daonna, le dh&aacute; shampla a thabhairt.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre ar na h&aacute;bhair sin.  The agreement could be stronger in the context of the environment and human rights, to give two examples.  The African Development Bank is a financial provider to African governments and private companies investing in the regional member countries.  I am unaware of what structures, if any, are in place to monitor the human rights due diligence of companies that receive moneys from the African Development Bank.  We also must guard against the hollowing out of the state.  The state is a key driver in development, not companies that only care about their bottom lines in these regions.  Until robust state structures which redistribute wealth and provide for the social needs of citizens are in place and functioning correctly economic underdevelopment and inequality will continue to exist.  Caithfimid b&eacute;im a chur ar sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh na strucht&uacute;ir ann le cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil maoinithe na t&iacute;ortha seo &aacute; roinnt mar is ceart, go bhfuil na nithe s&oacute;isialta ann do saor&aacute;naigh agus go bhfuil na coinn&iacute;ollacha cearta eacnama&iacute;ochta sna t&iacute;ortha seo sa d&oacute;igh is go mbeidh cothroma&iacute;ocht iontu.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Many African countries are displaying incredible economic growth on paper but, like in Ireland, that does not reflect the reality of those countries' positions and definitely does not mean that each country is providing for the needs of its citizens.  The infrastructure sector, including power supply, water, sanitation, transportation and communications, has traditionally received the largest share of African Development Bank lending.  While Africa is not the continent that is producing the worst pollution and degradation of the environment it is one of the hardest hit.  We must acknowledge that.  It is important for organisations such as the African Development Bank to give financing to programmes to develop renewable energy technologies adapted to the natural environments of different African climates and the unique and specific energy needs of African countries.<br\/><br\/>I cannot let this opportunity pass without looking at how our other policies interact with development in these regions.  I have made this point on numerous occasions, not least when we were discussing the Finance Bill.  In particular, I raise the issue when discussing our corporation tax policy and other policies and how they interact with developing nations and territories.  When debating the Finance Bill, we discussed how Ireland has chosen the weakest model under the controlled foreign company, CFC, rules and the multilateral convention, where we have opted out of Article 12.  These decisions have consequences in other places, and we cannot ignore that.  To do so is wrong.  Tagann s&eacute; salach ar an mh&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don bhanc agus don chiste infreastrucht&uacute;rtha seo go bhfuilimid ag glacadh cinnt&iacute; ar an taobh eile at&aacute; impleachta&iacute; di&uacute;ltachta acu ar na r&eacute;igi&uacute;in seo.  Not only has Ireland opted out of Article 12 and chosen the weakest model of the CFC rules and the multilateral convention, it still opposes public country-by-country reporting.  That should end now.<br\/><br\/>Tugaim taca&iacute;ocht don Bhille seo and I hope our other policies match much of the rhetoric about the intent behind the Bill that we have heard here today.  Given what we are dealing with, is d&oacute;cha nach mbeidh an Rialtas s&aacute;sta bogadh ar na h&aacute;bhair at&aacute; luaite agam ag an roghchoiste airgeadais agus ar an Tuarasc&aacute;il ar ais sa D&aacute;il.  &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, beidh mise agus mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don Bhille seo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300040#NN00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542095100,"counter":538,"content":"<p>The future of Africa is central to the future of the planet.  As Africa, hopefully, enters a period of renaissance continent-wide, we must interrogate what this Bill proposes to do for, and in partnership with, it.  Will it represent a positive development in Ireland's relationship with Africa or will it turn our development co-operation programme and Irish Aid into a more exploitative relationship with the continent?  Rather than the people, the environment and the ecosystems of Africa benefiting, will it mark a milestone where our relationship with Africa will become a tied aid only relationship in which, as donors, to use an old-fashioned term, or contributors, we will seek to tie our development support to a crudely exploitative model of the type with which Africa is all too familiar?  Ireland was never a colonial power as many of our European neighbours were.  Reading the list of European countries involved with the development bank, one sees that more than 90% of them were once colonial powers.  Although Ireland does not have that history - far from it - we must be fully aware of the appalling cruelty and disaster visited on Africa by European and other colonial powers down through the centuries.<\/p><p>Great African civilisations in places such as Zimbabwe that date back thousands of years lie in ruins because of the exploitation, greed, death and killing in Africa.<\/p> <p> Can we think about the legacy of the slave trade on Africa and its impact right up to this day?  Can we also consider the horrible legacy of the slave trade, which is racism?  Even though the experiences of people coming from Africa to live in Ireland have been mostly positive, we are not entirely free from that.  Rather than just turning business people away from any consideration of all the negative things that have happened to Africa, I want to hear the Minister of State say that we can use the Bill as an opportunity to face into these legacy issues, regarding which we also must interrogate ourselves.  This is not a pat on the back for Ireland.  The sums involved are small and we have not reached our development pledge of 0.7% of GDP to be spent on development projects.  This is the context in which we debate the Bill.<\/p> <p> We need to be assured that the African Development Bank is not helping vultures and jackals in the way one can see them in the Serengeti by stripping the continent bare as happened in history and leaving the bleached bones to lie there.  We need reassurance and some commentary on how this connection with the bank, which was founded in the heady days of liberation and independence of the 1960s, will change for the better.  I believe it was Harold Macmillan who spoke of the \"wind of change\" blowing through the continent when he visited Africa.  Yet, that speech was followed by the horrible decades of apartheid, especially in South Africa.  I speak as a former secretary of the anti-apartheid movement in Ireland, and I speak as a former Minister of State with responsibility for ODA.  Earlier in my life, I also worked in Tanzania in east Africa.  When I became a Minister, I did a lot of work in the aftermath of the genocide.  Ireland needs to be clear eyed about what it is we intend to achieve with this modest couple of million euro a year.  It is an important but modest amount.<\/p> <p> Africa is beautiful, immense and incredibly wealthy in culture, natural resources and people.  We have to find a language and framework that says we will assist that and not simply exploit it.  I am worried at the reference to this connection being just about trade rather than development.  A cornerstone of Ireland's development programme has been that it is not a tied aid programme.  I want to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, that he is not arbitrarily changing the policy now for short-term gain, be it to Ireland or to Africa.<\/p> <p> We are aware of what happened in Africa's history.  Ireland cannot, and should not, turn a blind eye.  I refer to some of the areas that are referred to in the Department's papers and in the objectives of the bank.  We specifically want to know about the people-centred development, which is about eliminating poverty and developing a positive economic programme.  It is for the Minister of State to show us how this will be achieved by Ireland joining the African Development Bank, how it will lead to less exploitation and not more, and how it will empower and provide for African women and children who tend to be at the bottom of the pile when it comes to economic development.<\/p> <p> I say all of this in the context of Ireland having signed up to the UN development goals.  They have had a lot of success but there is a great deal of corruption in Africa.  Corruption is the modern day problem of Africa that holds it back.  Even countries such as South Africa have incredible experience of appalling corruption.  Development banks and bankers are sharp people.  They can persuade entire countries that a dam here or a river there is in the interests of economic growth but they may move many people away from their traditional lands, which may not be in the interests of a sustainable environment.  These issues are difficult and it is difficult to know the right answers to them, but instead of patting ourselves on the back, we should seek to interrogate this.  Many people in Ireland have been, and currently are, involved in development in a positive way.  We should take many of those people as our models, as opposed to the bankers in the sharp suits.  Will there be a reference to ensuring that the IFSC does not develop potential for money laundering such as robbing of assets from poor countries and empowering, in some cases, dictators?  Has the Department thought about this and how it might be prevented?  What will Ireland's approach be to the endemic problem of corruption in Africa, or are we simply just not going to talk about it? Wherever one goes in Africa, notwithstanding great economic, educational and other developments, corruption is so incredibly pervasive that at times it would make a person despair.  It is at the cost of poor people and rural people.  It is also at the cost of the drugs they do not have in the health services to cure simple diseases such as malaria and of not having fair trade.  Many restaurants and coffee shops in Ireland are ambassadors for fair trade.  The restaurants and the bars in the Houses of the Oireachtas largely buy Fair Trade products.  This is positive co-operation that will help people and empower them to grow.<\/p> <p> There are very good models such as those developed by B&oacute;thar and many branches of the Irish Farmers' Association to help African farmers to improve the breeding of livestock and to provide livestock.  These are small businesses and, in many cases, small farms.  Is this the model we will choose to assist with business development?<\/p> <p> I also want to know from Fine Gael if this will be about Fine Gael businessmen going to African financial partners with Government accreditation or will the party take its courage in its hands and support a financial transactions tax?  Africa generates a vast volume of the mineral wealth in the world but it only secures a fraction of that wealth in return for its countries.<\/p><p>I am not saying I expect the Minister of State to be able to provide any of these solutions.  I want him to question how our programme might go about beginning to do that in line with current economic developments.  I want to ask about heavily indebted poor countries, HIPC, and debt forgiveness for many countries.  We know a lot about debt forgiveness in Ireland because we do not get it for people who are very often at the end of their tether in terms of trying to meet mortgage commitments and hold on to their family homes.  We know about vulture funds and what they have done since they came to Ireland.  I want to know if we can apply the framework of some of the experiences and difficulties we had during the crash, when lots of people lost their employment and huge amounts of whatever wealth they had managed to build up.  Out of that learning may come programmes that are both modern and relevant to how we might have a relationship with African countries.<\/p> <p> As Nelson Mandela said, we know that the key development tool is education.  Will co-operation in terms of education be an appropriate area for development and investment?  In particular, what is badly needed in Africa is both apprenticeship training and third level education.  I also refer to investment in drugs, for instance to treat malaria, a disease that kills many people and reduces the life capacity of millions right throughout the African continent.  We have big pharma all over Ireland.  Will we lend some of our expertise to try to get rid of the scourge of treatable diseases like malaria?  We have a small NGO here called Engineers without Borders, founded in Ireland by engineers from DIT in particular.  Students from all over Ireland take part in projects at third level to look at how to improve water quality, sanitation and conservation in terms of what is happening as a result of climate change.  These are all small business-type developments that often have enormous consequences for improving people's quality of life.  Has that been given consideration?  On agriculture, I am sure the Minister of State is aware that most farmers in Africa are women and most farm assistants in Africa are children.  Anything that seriously improves the lives of farmers and children living on small family farms will certainly get my support.<\/p> <p> We really have not heard anything about the vision behind this Bill.  Are we just signing up to this as something the Department of Finance, the officials and the Minister of the day can be involved in or is there some vision that is ethical, empowering and constructive in terms ecology and good quality growth that helps people's lives?  If the Minister of State can answer these questions I do not think I would have any difficulty in supporting the Bill but I do want to hear the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300041#OO00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542096300,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Pringle.  It has to be acknowledged that Ireland has a special relationship with Africa and that began with the work of many missionaries in education and health.  That work has been enhanced and added to by the various Irish NGOs.  Central to that work has been community empowerment in those countries in Africa, so that their citizens are providing the education, health and social services that are vital.  I have been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade since 2009 and from that and my involvement with the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, I know the respect for Ireland that exists in those countries in the global south.<\/p>  <p>  It has been mentioned that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence did a review of our aid programme.  We produced it back in February 2018 and after many months it eventually got approximately 30 minutes' debate in the Chamber.  Then it was adjourned and has not reappeared.  I cannot help contrasting that with the time being given to the African Development Bank.  We have three hours now and if that is not enough there will be more hours tomorrow or Thursday.  Banking matters obviously take precedence over our overseas development aid, ODA.  The committee's conclusions and recommendations recognised and strongly supported the central focus within Irish aid, which is to address the needs of the poorest and the most vulnerable.  Ireland has been a strong advocate for maintaining a poverty focused definition of ODA.  It is also important to recognise the work of our ambassadors and the embassy staff in the 11 African countries that have a role in the African Development Bank.  Countries in Africa trust Ireland.  That comes from the fact that our aid is poverty focused and driven by certain targets.  The respect and trust are particularly due to the fact that our aid is untied.  We have a 100% record in untied aid which means we have not looked for anything in return, until now anyway.<\/p>  <p>  A very strong recommendation from the committee was on the need to improve policy coherence.  We have the experience and the examples of policy incoherence.  We are giving the aid but the incoherence comes with certain tax issues.  It also comes in respect of climate change and when it comes to the arms trade.  We are giving the aid with one hand while taking it back with the other because of what we are not doing in respect of climate change and tax practises and in failing to stand up at EU and UN level to those countries that are making billions of euro from the arms trade.  Our committee strongly recommended a cross-government plan of action as recommended by the OECD, as well as establishing a cross-departmental body to ensure better co-ordination and coherence of development policy across government and in line with the strategic development goals, SDGs.  We have been following a coherent policy to date when it comes to the aid-for-trade debate and agenda because of our aid being 100% untied.  Because of that, my experience is that African countries do want to trade with Ireland because they trust us that the business will be ethical and fair.  While we have the fair trade brand, it needs to be more than just a brand name.<\/p>  <p>  Where does Ireland's membership of the African Development Bank fit in with our existing reputation and the relationships we have had with countries in Africa to date?  African countries need to be able to develop their own resources, some of which are considerable.  Those resources have to be for the benefit of the people.  Some African countries are seeing strong economic growth and are moving into the range of middle-income countries but it is as if they make progress in one direction only for it to be impeded by other factors elsewhere.  The ironic reality is that we have strong economic growth alongside extreme poverty.  While the mantra for the sustainable development goals is to leave no one behind, millions are being left behind for various reasons, perhaps because of where they live, or because they are female or have a disability; it could be their ethnicity or their gender.  Even where the success of the millennium development goals is acknowledged with statistics showing a significant increase in primary school enrolment, for example, such goals can still leave an awful lot to be desired because we are not talking about quality education with the necessary resources and suitably qualified teachers.  While there have been positive results in child mortality rates and nutrition, for example the Scaling Up Nutrition programmes, what are these children surviving for if they are to remain in dire poverty, hunger, conflict and displacement?  That is why there is a need for policy coherence across all of these areas including economics and banking.<\/p>  <p>  Irish exports to Africa have been increasing in recent years.  In 2017, the total value of exports to Africa was &euro;1.42 billion.<\/p><p>However, we import less than half that amount resulting in an imbalance there.  When it comes to the EU trade agreements there is also a danger of imbalance with these agreements being more to the benefit of the European country.  In the context of Brexit I believe we will see more examples of trade being more for the benefit of the non-African countries.  I again give a very simple example relating to chickens.  There was a lucrative European trade in frozen chicken parts to west Africa and yet west Africa had thriving small businesses in live chickens.  This is where we are seeing that imbalance with the local businesses losing out.<\/p> <p> The Library and Research Service has outlined the mission strategy and goals.  They refer to inclusive growth and helping Africa gradually transition to green growth.  The areas for annual financing needs are as follows: light up and power Africa; feed Africa; industrialise Africa; integrate Africa; and improve the quality of life for the people of Africa.  However, the other table dealing with the progress in these is abysmal, as is clear to anyone who visits those countries.  If those are the needs, we need more regular progress reports on how those needs are being met.  For example, 8.3 million Africans have improved access to water and sanitation.  While that is very welcome, it is a very low number.  At the same time Africa is experiencing population growth, part of the reason being lack of access to reproductive and sexual health measures.<\/p> <p> The business and human rights report eventually came out after a number of years.  It is languishing somewhere still waiting to go to the committee and still awaiting implementation.  If we are planning to become a member of the African Development Bank, surely the whole area of rights needs to come into that.  Some of those on the list of subscribers leave much to be desired on human rights, which makes me wonder who is benefiting.  There are also questions over the investment in certain countries in Africa.  In particular, I know there are concerns over China and what its agenda is.<\/p> <p> On the role of other banks, a recent report showed that 119 countries in the global south were critically in debt.  In 87 of them the debt situations had worsened over the past four years and 13 countries had ceased payments to creditors.  The IMF loan policy conditions continue to be highly controversial in key economic policy areas.  What is Ireland's stance in supporting the non-payment of unjust global south debt?  The economic policy conditionality of the IMF and its partnership organisation, the World Bank, has been damaging.  The governance of the IMF and the World Bank needs fundamental reform to ensure fair representation of global south nations when it comes to decision making.  At least the African Development Bank had 23 African countries as founding members.<\/p> <p> I hope our membership of the African Development Bank will be of benefit and will continue the very positive relationship we have had with African countries and will not undermine or demean the relationship that has been built up over many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300043#QQ00200","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542096900,"counter":543,"content":"<p>The Bill seeks to establish Ireland&rsquo;s membership as a non-regional applicant country to the regional multilateral development finance institution, known as the African Development Bank.  The bank established in the 1960s declares its aim to be to contribute to the economic development and social progress of African countries.  The African Development Bank declares its central mission to be helping to reduce poverty, improve living conditions and mobilise resources for the continent&rsquo;s economic and social development.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s status as an ex-colony with a long history of missionary work fosters a natural relationship between this country and African states.  We have a long tradition of offering strong support in programme countries in Africa as part of our overseas development budget.  The Government is very open on its policy objective in joining the bank which is to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s political, development, economic, trade and cultural relationships.<\/p>  <p>  While development and social progress is the motto from the bank and Ireland&rsquo;s interests are spread out over trade and cultural relationships, unfortunately significant failings exist in the operation of the African Development Bank.  I believe the membership of developed nations in the bank is mainly to blame for these shortcomings.  The bank&rsquo;s ownership structure consists of African and non-African countries.  However, over time a situation has developed in which only 11 African countries feature among the top 20 of the bank&rsquo;s most powerful member countries.  Between them, the 11 countries account for only around 40% of the vote.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s subscription for membership of the bank will be &euro;65.14 million to be encashed in up to eight annual instalments of approximately &euro;8 million.  This would notionally place Ireland 34th of 79 members with a shareholding of 0.799%.  Ireland will have a higher percentage share in the African Development Bank than Tanzania, Mauritius, Madagascar and Mozambique.  This level of inequality is a huge concern for the African nations involved.  How can a small western developed country like Ireland with a population of only 5 million have more voting rights in an international bank than, for example, Tanzania which has a population of 57.3 million, Madagascar which has a population of 25.5 million or Mozambique which has a population of 29.6 million?<\/p>  <p>  The African Development Bank has failed to retain significant voting power within the region because it is designed and modelled on other international banks set up by developed nations such as the World Bank.  These banks are beacons for the global neoliberal agenda, the exact cause of persistent economic poverty in African states.  They have promoted a system of trade injustices robbing countries of funds which are rightfully theirs.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of being free to follow economic policies that best suit them, countries in southern Africa are being put under enormous pressure to open up their markets and expose their producers to unfair competition.  Trade rules and agreements also often allow big business to profit at the expense of people and the environment.  Will Ireland's involvement in the African Development Bank put a stop to that?  Unfortunately, I doubt it.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget that most development projects in Africa are still World Bank-led, with the African Development Bank only occasionally playing a supporting or facilitation role.  African members of the bank are demoted to positions of subservience to richer developed nations and their economic priorities - no doubt neoliberal in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The EU engages in harmful trade practices.  According to one analysis, of the 7,000 harmful trade measures implemented by countries across the globe since 2009, more than half have come from the EU.  The bank itself has made it clear that the continent&rsquo;s nations bore the brunt of measures including export taxes, tariff and non-tariff barriers and state aid.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland should be pushing for more democratic change and transparency as part of its membership because as it stands the model the African Development Bank has copied means that development needs are not prioritised based on the fundamental needs of its member countries.  The decision-making process is thereby compromised and we are feeding into this neoliberal machine by seeking membership without calling for a change in its governance structure.  For effective agenda setting, the bank must revisit its ownership and voting structure with the required acceptance of responsibility this would entail.<\/p>  <p>  Africa cannot afford to replicate neoliberal institutions like the World Bank or maintain their hegemonic existence in nation states.  Despite strong economic growth in the past decade, 45.1% of the population of African countries represented in the bank still live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 a day.<\/p>  <p>  Representatives of various African civil society groups met in Dakar from 10 to 12 May 2009, shadowing the 44th annual assembly of the African Development Bank.  At this meeting, the performance of the African Development Bank in a number of countries and the role the bank has played in mobilising resources for development on the continent was assessed as was the bank&rsquo;s relationship with civil society, which is vital for the promotion of the welfare of people in member states as is the stated mission of the bank.<\/p>  <p>  However, these civil society groups remarked on how the bank has drifted away from its original message of welfare of the African people and the development of the continent.  In their view the bank had become nothing more than a clone of the international financial institutions.  Profitability had replaced meeting the basic needs of the population as the main criterion for project selection.  The bank has submitted to the neoliberal agenda by subscribing to the tenets of market fundamentalism.  The African Development Bank has further served to promote the very liberalisation and privatisation policies that have exacerbated the economic and social crisis on the continent.  The group also felt that the bank had not come up with a single noteworthy initiative of its own to resolve the African debt crisis and has instead merely adopted the proposals put forward by the World Bank and the IMF.<\/p>  <p>  The incorporation of non-African countries has provided these new players a level of unprecedented influence that is not reflective of their investment in the African Development Bank.  Many have power of veto over the orientation and the policies of the bank making it a completely undemocratic institution, serving the interests of the global elite.<\/p>  <p>  It has been documented that the African Development Bank does not engage in true dialogue with civil society, preferring to engage in policies that avoid any critique by African citizens.<\/p><p>Civil society groups have called for the following to bring about greater engagement with civil society in its policies and decision-making: first, to establish an information-sharing policy; second, to re-establish an independent environmental assessment mechanism; and third, to consider the long-term financial needs of African countries within the context of sustainable development.<\/p> <p> There is a need for Africa-relevant development strategies.  The bank's coming of age after 50 years must reflect in its engaged understudy of the region&rsquo;s problems, development of appropriate strategies and readiness to offer technical support to implement them.  Collaboration with experts across African universities is a prudent way of ensuring this.  Scholars who study their environment from within are best placed to point to relevant and effective solutions.<\/p> <p> Alongside trade justice, will Irish representatives in the bank promote the principle of climate justice?  Our economic practices over the past century have caused this global phenomenon and yet it will be the poorest populations paying the highest price.  To what extent will funds be used to develop defences for communities most exposed to climate change and will we do our part leading by example on climate change mitigation?  Crises due to drought in Africa is certainly not a new phenomenon.  However, with climate change, the frequency and intensity has risen sharply over the past decade.  Rainfall is becoming increasingly unreliable.  As a result, crops fail, animals die, livelihoods are lost and people have no food to feed their families.  Many are forced to flee to the cities where they live in slums in appalling conditions.  Africa, the poorest and least developed of the world&rsquo;s regions, will find it particularly difficult to adjust without assistance from developed nations.  Although sub-Saharan Africa produces less than 4% of the world&rsquo;s greenhouse gases, scientists predict with very high confidence that the region&rsquo;s diverse climates and ecological systems have already been altered by global warming and will undergo further damage in the years ahead.  A third of Africa&rsquo;s people already live in drought-prone regions and climate changes could put the lives and livelihoods of an additional 75 million to 250 million people at risk by the end of the next decade.  Flood-prone areas in southern Africa, on the other hand, are likely to become wetter as rainfall patterns shift, causing floods to become more frequent and severe and diverting resources from development to emergency relief.  Ireland must address the issue of climate justice on global platforms like African Development Bank and use its political and economic leverage to encourage alternative economic models suited to African nation states and their populations' needs.  It must encourage the opening up of the bank towards more democratic and transparent governance structures and decision-making processes with central involvement from civil society.  Unfortunately, I do not think we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300044#RR00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542097500,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I will interrupt the Minister of State at 8 p.m. and ask him to propose the adjournment of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300045#SS00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1542097500,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I will make sure to conclude by then because I want to move on to the next Stage.  A huge number of questions have been asked by all who contributed.  I do not have the answers to all the questions so I will not pretend. We can try to get into more detail on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of our international development policy with regard to extending our influence in the African region in line with the objectives of the 2025 initiative, we feel this is the best way of doing it.  Deputies noted the important work of African Development Bank in terms of contributing to the economic and social development of the African region and its important role in continuing to drive its economic transformation for the future.  Like other development banks, it has a role which is to provide funding for ethical projects.  It was very similar to the conversation we had about the AIIB.  The objective here is not that Ireland will invest in an institution that will just operate as it sees fit.  There are governance structures in place and I will touch upon them.<\/p>  <p>  The fund will require the approval of our membership by the board of directors and subsequently by the board of governors.  It is expected it will take place at the next annual meeting in June 2019 in Malabo.  That will complete our membership.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the bank's safeguards and standards and the question about how Ireland can influence these, this section encompasses most of the questions that have been asked.  African Development Bank's integrated safeguard system adopted in 2013 is the cornerstone of its strategy to promote growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.  As I have already mentioned, safeguarding standards are already in place in which MOPAN found that African Development Bank is particularly strong.  It is highlighted by the assessment that facilitates the delivery of high social and environmental standards including through the screening of all projects at the bank against gender, environment and climate change criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  Specifically with regard to gender, 2017 saw the gender, women and civil society department become fully operational and the approval of the gender marker system, the bank's approach to mainstreaming gender in its operational work, with the roll out taking place this year.<\/p>  <p>  On climate change, African Development Bank has pledged triple climate financing to reach 40% of investments by 2020.  In 2017, African Development Bank made strides on these targets with about 28% of all approvals allocated as climate finance.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of how Ireland can input into this area, as in the case of the other multilateral development banks, Ireland will seek to use its influence in co-ordination with our members and constituency partners to ensure the high performance and standards of African Development Bank is maintained or improved where necessary as the bank evolves.<\/p>  <p>  A question has been asked about Ireland.  Is Ireland progressing in meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA?  The programme for Government sets out our ambition to make progress on this target as resources allow.  This commitment reaffirms our global initiative 2025, which was published this year.  Based on current forecasts we anticipate the percentage of ODA for 2017 having reached 0.3% of GNP.  However, recent revisions of GNP have reduced this percentage despite increases in overall funding for ODA in recent years.  The Government's ambition is to meet the 0.7% target through sustained managed increments.  ODA will be required.  Ireland will continue to work towards this target as economic circumstances allow but our contributions to African Development Bank and fund will also develop and contribute towards that.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to a more detailed discussion on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300045#SS00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542097500,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"African Development (Bank and Fund) Bill 2018: Referral to Select Committee","time":1542097500,"counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300045#SS00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1542097500,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300045#SS00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542097500,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Housing Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2018: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1542097500,"counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300045#SS00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1542097500,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to formally declare the housing and homelessness crisis a national emergency.  The Bill provides for the delimiting of the rights of landlords, banks and finance houses, including vulture funds, in order to prevent tenants and mortgage holders from eviction as provided for under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and as advocated for by Focus Ireland and many other agencies dealing with homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 March, the Taoiseach addressed the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  He stated \"I have no difficulty whatsoever describing the housing shortage or the homelessness crisis as an emergency.\"  The situation has worsened significantly since then.  Comparing like-with-like figures, by September 2018 the total number of homeless had increased by 1,497 persons including 442 extra adults and a shocking 1,055 extra children, reaching a total of 11,304 persons.<\/p><p>Focus Ireland also pointed out that 193 additional children became homeless in September alone.<br\/><br\/>Last week, Professor Eoin O&rsquo;Sullivan, head of the school of social work and social policy at Trinity College Dublin, advised the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that the housing situation would get worse next year.  He said that much more than 50% of people who become homeless are from the private rented sector, that rents are escalating rapidly, and that until something is done about the right to terminate tenancies there will be a continuing flow into homelessness.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday there were shocking new figures of rent increases.  Rents nationwide rose by 11.3% in the year to September, with no slowdown in sight, as average rents nationally were pushed to an all-time high of &euro;1,334, &euro;304 or 30% more expensive than during the Celtic tiger.  The average rent in Dublin is close to &euro;2,000 per month, while rental growth in Limerick exceeded 20% in the past year.  It is clear the Government's policy of rent pressure areas is simply not working.  The national spokesperson for the Simon Community, Niamh Randall, put it in a nutshell when she said on radio that rents cannot be controlled while evictions from the private rented sector continue.<br\/><br\/>Tenants are afraid to complain lest they be evicted, and there is no national register of rents.  New tenants have no way of knowing what the rent paid by the previous tenant was, and dare not ask lest they be excluded from consideration for scarce accommodation and end up homeless.  The Government knows well that its policy of rent control in rent pressure zones is not working, as it has repeatedly been told by the various homeless agencies.<br\/><br\/>The dice are loaded in favour of landlords.  While some decent landlords are not taking advantage, the commercial landlords, including the vultures, are.  Irish citizens are paying a heavy price and the common good is not served by current Government policy.  At least half a million people in the Republic are in housing situations that are causing them serious distress, as homelessness campaigner Fr. Peter McVerry stated at a conference in Liberty Hall recently.<br\/><br\/>As legislators, we all have a responsibility to change drastically this situation in the interest of the common good.  D&aacute;il Eireann has, by majority, called on the Government to propose emergency measures to do so, through a Private Members&rsquo; motion that called on the Government to declare the housing and homelessness crisis an emergency; to reduce the flow of adults and children into homelessness through emergency legislation making it illegal for landlords, banks and investment funds to evict tenants and homeowners in mortgage distress into homelessness; to provide real security of tenure and real rent certainty; to introduce measures to reduce the cost of rent; and to introduce a target date to end long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough.<br\/><br\/>As an Opposition Deputy, under Standing Orders I am not allowed to propose a money Bill.  Accordingly, the Bill implements only measures to halt the worsening situation.  Focus Ireland has repeatedly highlighted through its services and research that the main reason for families becoming homeless is that they are being evicted from their homes by private landlords due to properties being sold or repossessed.  To remedy this, the right to private property must be delimited, as provided for in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in Article 43.2.2&deg;, which states: &ldquo;The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.&rdquo;  A large number of citizens are being subjected to unreasonable and extortionate rents, contrary to the common good, and the problem is worsening continuously.  This must be halted.  <br\/><br\/>Section 1 provides that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann affirms in law that a housing emergency exists.  Section 2 provides that a housing emergency will continue for a period of three years after the passing of the Bill and that the Government will bring a review before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the expiry of the three year period.  Section 3 provides that no tenant shall be evicted from a buy-to-let dwelling, that is, a dwelling purchased for letting purposes, during the period of this national housing emergency.  Section 4 provides that there shall be no further increase in rents on dwellings.  Section 5 provides that existing private rents shall be reduced to reasonable levels, having regard to the differential rent that would be payable by a tenant <i>in situ<\/i>to a local authority for rental of a similar dwelling.  Section 6 provides that no resident of a mortgaged dwelling shall be evicted from that dwelling during the period of this national housing emergency.<br\/><br\/>Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, the State delimited the exercise of private property rights by public service pensioners.  The Bill seeks to use the same provision in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to delimit the powers of landlords to evict people and to oppress them with unreasonable and extortionate rents.  The measures enacted under this Bill supersede all existing law on the matters concerned while the emergency continues, and the housing emergency formally brought into existence by this measure will continue for a three year period from enactment, allowing time for the fundamental causes of the housing emergency to be addressed.  Large-scale public housing on public land is required.<br\/><br\/>Speaking at a recent seminar to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the civil rights movement, Fr. McVerry said the Government was facing a catastrophe, with the housing crisis set to deepen.  He called for a major Government programme of social housing construction on a scale not seen in decades to alleviate the crisis.  He said that we could have a catastrophe coming down the road unless Government policy changes.  The Government&rsquo;s response to homelessness and social housing was to provide three out of every four houses in the private rented sector but this sector is part of the problems, not part of the solution.  Fr. McVerry said that most people becoming homeless are out because they were evicted from the private rented sector.<br\/><br\/>The Bill does not provide for the increased building of public housing on public land.  If it did, it would have been ruled out of order as a money Bill.  It implements measures, however, for the common good to prevent the situation continuing to worsen and provides some alleviation of the extreme distress being suffered by significant numbers of people while long-term solutions are put in place.  Its passage would force the Government to accept that its current housing policies have failed and it would give an opportunity to Oireachtas Members to change the failed policies of this minority Government.<br\/><br\/>Some Deputies may have difficulty with some of the measures proposed, while others may have additional proposals.  These can be discussed on Committee Stage, where detailed amendments can be tabled and discussed.  I appeal to Deputies, therefore, to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  At the end of the three year period of the national housing emergency, the Oireachtas will review the situation and consider how to proceed for the common good in the context of the housing and homelessness situation at that time.  Once again, I appeal to Deputies and, in particular, to Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government, to support the Bill, which is crucial to addressing the disastrous housing situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300045#SS00900","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542098100,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and the general topic, which is timely given that <i>daft.ie<\/i>published a report yesterday.<\/p><p>It demonstrated the chaos in the current rental market.  Today, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was quoted as saying that rising rents are causing much anxiety.  That is a great understatement.  There is sheer panic.  Frustration is spilling over because of the stress experienced by individuals and households, including children.  Does the Minister for Finance really understand the degree of anxiety felt by a person who faces a cumulative 36% increase in their rent over a period?  This was another report on top of a pile of previous reports for each quarter going back years.  Each time one of these reports is published, it details yet more rent increases.  It clearly shows a sector which has been allowed to spiral out of control.  The State's inactivity of building the required level of housing has contributed to the shortfall in housing and rising rents.<br\/><br\/>When is the right time to shout stop?  Rents are at an unsustainably high level.  The Social Democrats have called for an immediate nationwide rent freeze, but we recognise that freezing rents at such high levels will not be a complete solution - or indeed any solution - for people who are at the pin of their collar.  However, it would ensure that we will not be here next quarter or the one after that to discuss the increase being 38% or 40%.  There must be a point at which we say stop; we think that we reached this point long ago.  Deputy Healy has been calling for an emergency to be declared on this for several years and this legislation would give some teeth to that.<br\/><br\/>I listened to the chairperson of one of the landlords' associations on radio yesterday morning.  He said that it would be unfair to force purchasers of buy-to-let properties to keep existing tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  In the current situation, I fundamentally disagree.  We need emergency responses.  What would be unfair would be to turf out a tenant who had met all the terms of his or her tenancy agreement and force him or her either into homelessness or to face a significant rent hike at another property.<br\/><br\/>We must take a sustainable view on this.  We cannot allow market forces to continuously pile people onto the streets or into emergency accommodation.  That is in no one's interest.  It damages the social fabric of our country but also the economy.  We can see significant societal damage.  There cannot be one of us here who does not experience families coming to us in panic.  They tell us things like &quot;Homelessness was never something I expected to happen to somebody like me&quot;.  That is typical of what people say.  When they come in first, they say they have four months notice.  Invariably, one sees them in the following weeks and one tries to give them as much advice as possible and try to find alternative accommodation but it is just not there.  One can see the deterioration in people from the time they receive the eviction notice to when they either find somewhere or they face having to find somewhere to store their possessions or perhaps find temporary accommodation.<br\/><br\/>We must be realistic; we are not just talking about a few people.  Typically, we see couples where both are at work.  We see families, individuals, ordinary workers.  The average rent in Dublin is now &euro;1,968 a month, &euro;32 shy of &euro;2,000 a month often for fairly average homes.  We are not talking about mansions, we are talking about typical homes.  It takes only a basic understanding of economics to know that if that figure continues to rise, there will be hundreds if not thousands more who will find themselves forced into homelessness.<br\/><br\/>Talking about percentages can be easy but, in practical terms, the average rent in Dublin is now close to &euro;2,000, which means that a family or a person renting in Dublin is paying close to &euro;24,000 on rent, before utilities, food, the cost of getting to work and other costs.  Even if someone took home &euro;50,000 after tax, which is a good income, rent would still account for more than 50% of their income.  For those of more modest means, the reality is even more stark.  There are people paying 60% or 70% of their income to put a roof over their head.  People who run the food stalls in town say that people are coming to them looking for food who are not homeless.  What does that tell us?  The knock on effects for the rest of society become obvious.  Greater demands on wages means less disposable income circulating in the economy, consumer activity decreases and businesses suffer as a result.  That is before we begin to consider the societal and human cost of forcing people into everyday poverty, just because they are trying to put a modest roof over their head.  It is also unsustainable, as the Minister knows, from the perspective of rent assistance or HAP because rents are spiralling.<br\/><br\/>The time for hand-wringing is long gone.  There must be emergency measures to put a full stop on this while a more accelerated construction programme is under way.  We hear that close to 10,000 individuals, adults and children, are in homelessness but that is not the full story.  Others during the same year will also have experienced homelessness.  In the past year, an additional 4,000 people will have had experienced homelessness and gone through that panic.  Numbers are important.  There is a big thing about trying not to get to 10,000 and numbers have been disputed.  When we see the scale of what we are discussing, when one adds those who have experienced homelessness and those who are currently in homelessness, it can be called nothing other than an emergency.I really want it to get better and to be able to compliment the Minister and say that things are working but I am sorry that I cannot.  Based on what I see, anecdotally, if I were to say if things are getting better or worse, I would say that it is far worse this year than last year.  It is almost impossible to find properties for people to rent and the levels of rent that are being demanded are not possible for ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300046#TT00200","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542098700,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this Bill.

There are also a number of constitutional difficulties with the Bill.  Even if we could overcome those two hurdles, concrete ideas are put forward in this Bill that would do more harm than good.  There are unintended consequences that have not been properly thought through.  People will come forward with an idea to deal with a particular problem or aspect of our housing crisis and it might do somebody some good at that moment but we must be aware of the unintended consequences which they have not thought of or considered that would ripple through and, potentially, cause more harm than good.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach has said that this is an emergency and the Bill refers to declaring an emergency.  We must ask whether the absence of a formal declaration of an emergency prevents us from putting in place emergency responses.  No, it does not because we have already put in place emergency responses.  One example is the change in planning law.  The Deputy who introduced this Bill knows the importance of planning law.  I am sure all the Deputies are in constituencies where objections have been submitted in respect of different  types of developments.  We know the importance of the right of individuals to be able to make their observations known when planning applications are submitted and yet we have put in place an emergency response in respect of fast-track planning.<br\/><br\/>Another way we could look at the question regarding the formal declaration of an emergency is in terms of whether such a declaration allows us to do something that we are not already doing.  The answer to that is &quot;No, it could not&quot;.  I have already looked at this and I  have spoken to the Attorney General on this.  For example, in the area of procurement law, if we could go outside of procurement, we could fast-track the delivery of housing, with supply being the fundamental issue, and get that done more quickly than at present.  However, EU law in this area is solid and cannot, even with the declaration of an emergency, be ignored.  That law was put in place to protect the public good because there are and can be - we have seen this in the past - negative consequences when people ignore procurement law or go around it.<br\/><br\/>Another issue is that relating to constitutional protections.  Would the declaration of an emergency allow us to ignore certain aspects of the Constitution?  No, it would not.  This does not mean that we cannot, in the context of the Constitution and the existing interpretations of it, rebalance rights away from the individual and towards the collective because we recognise that there is an emergency, but we cannot trample on those individual rights altogether.  I will provide brief examples of where we have rebalanced these constitutional rights.  The vacant site levy is one such example.  We have imposed a levy in respect of certain people's property - the property they own - because we care not happy with the way they are using or not using it as is the case may be.  Another example of where we have rebalanced those rights is the introduction of rent pressure zones and rent caps, with the putting in place of a restriction on what a person can charge for something he or she owns.  Rental reforms have been made and more will be made.  These will further limit the ways in which people use property they own.  We can rebalance rights in the context of the Constitution but we cannot trample on them at the same time.<br\/><br\/>The absence of a formal declaration of an emergency has not prevented us from putting in place emergency responses.  I mentioned the fast-track planning process.  This has seen planning approval been granted for thousands of new homes in the three-month timeframe that has been put in place.  The help-to-buy scheme to assist first-time buyers is a temporary emergency response.  The establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland is a temporary response which recognises the scale of the emergency in one part of our housing sector whereby small builders still cannot obtain money to build those small clusters of homes that we need built in many areas.  Family hubs are an emergency response because we recognise that hotel accommodation is not suitable for families.  The Housing First programme is a response to the emergency that exists and that will be with us for some time because the complexity of individual people in homelessness is one that takes years to resolve.  More than 200 tenancies have been created through the Housing First programme and between 80% to 90% of the people who have taken up those tenancies have not fallen back into homelessness.  It takes people out and keeps them out of emergency accommodation.<br\/><br\/>The rent caps are a temporary response we have put in place because there is not enough supply in the rental market.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is a new form of social support for people in the private rental market.  It provides for a discretion of 20% above prices and a homeless HAP discretion of 50% above prices, recognising the emergency that people are facing in trying to meet their bills and the fact that rent prices are too high.  Unfortunately, this means that the Government has to pay more until more homes are built.  Regulating short-term lets would be a longer term measure, again recognising the fact that there is not enough housing stock.  The initial response we took more than two years ago was to ring-fence &euro;6 billion in funding to deliver 50,000 homes into the stock of social housing to facilitate the production of at least 25,000 homes in that period, and building up to 110,000 social housing homes under Project Ireland 2040.  In all these measures we have taken, we recognise the emergency that exists and the severe difficulty in which people have been placed.  The Government and the Oireachtas are doing everything possible to put in place supports that can protect those people in this time of crisis.<br\/><br\/>The Bill refers to the emergency continuing for three years after its enactment.  I would welcome that time horizon because it recognises that this could not be solved overnight, even if we put in place additional responses.  Those the Deputy outlined are quite radical and, unfortunately, unconstitutional.  He refers to a  three-year period that would bring us to the end of 2021, which is the time horizon for Rebuilding Ireland.  The latter is a five or six-year plan that we have put in place to bring about real reform of the rental sector and introduce measures such as those relating to the cost-rental scheme.  I have spoken of the number of homes that need to built and the thousands of people and families who we have prevented from entering into emergency accommodation as a result of the different programmes that have been put in place under Rebuilding Ireland.  Thousands more will exit emergency accommodation during the period of the plan.  The Bill refers to a review at the end of the three-year period.  In Project Ireland 2040, we have already looked beyond 2021 and committed to the delivery of those 110,000 homes in the period to 2027.  That is approximately 12,000 homes per year going into the stock of social housing after 2021.  A huge amount has already been planned and prepared in order to ensure that when we exit this particular period of crisis, we will not fall into another crisis in the future.  We will also ensure that no matter what is happening in the wider economy - and there will be shocks in the future - we will never stop the State producing homes into the stock of social housing on local authority land.  That is very important.<br\/><br\/>I want to briefly go through some of the proposals in the Bill.  One of its provisions seeks to prohibit evictions.  We must be careful about the language used.  An eviction is very different from a notice of termination.  Evictions happen when people are not paying their rent or when there has been damage to the property.  Evictions are enforced through the courts.  Evictions are not the main source of people entering emergency accommodation but we know that one of the sources is in circumstances where notices of termination are served.  In introducing his Bill, the Deputy is trying to help people and ensure that the do not find themselves in that precarious position whereby they have to find somewhere new to live.  Too many people are in that situation but to put in place such a provision could dramatically reduce the supply of homes available to rent.  The rental sector is a part of the solution and we have more homes in the rental sectors not fewer.  We can give greater protections to renters through rent transparency, for which provision will be made in the Bill I will publish shortly.  We can give independent enforcement powers to the RTB so that renters do not have to worry about their positions, the RTB will do so for them.  We can give longer notice to quit periods so that individual renters will have has a greater period to find a new place to live when a notice of termination is served.  The Government's new Bill will do all of these things.<br\/><br\/>This Bill before the house seeks to freeze rents but we have to consider the unintended consequences to which this could give rise and which could do more harm than good.  Almost all economists agree that when one freezes rents in an economy or even in a particular geographic location, it undermines the supply of homes.  People also stay in their existing arrangements and there is less movement in the market.  A rental market needs movement.  Two people meet each other, they come together as a couple and move from having two homes to having one and that frees up one home, or two people in a relationship fall out of that relationship and need to move somewhere else and find a new place to live.  Economists who have looked at rent freezes see that this churn does not happen and that this prevents new people from entering into the market as they move to a country, come of working age or move to a different part of a country.  All these things have happened.  They have been tried and they have failed.<br\/><br\/>Another trend we see - and which means that rent freezes are not a social good - is that people who could afford to pay more are not obliged to do so.  This means that their potential rent increases are subsided by individuals who are earning less.  That is not socially desirable.  It is another unintended consequence of rent freezes.  However, we can and we have put rent caps in place.  We have capped rent increases at 4% per annum in rent pressure zones.  These have worked but they need to work better and we need to do more to ensure that this happens.  The Bill I will introduce in the near future will see to that.  It will strengthen rent pressure zones, make it a serious offence to be in breach of the rules relating to them and give the RTB more powers and resources to properly police them.<br\/><br\/>This Bill we are discussing also seeks to reduce all rents very dramatically.  However, 70% to 80% of our landlords own only one or two properties.  Many of them are accidental landlords because of the economic crash that we experienced.  They need fair rents in order to be able to cover the investments they have made.  They may have mortgages on second properties and those properties might be leveraged against their homes.  The unintended consequences of doing what is proposed would be to undermine those people's housing security.  It could make our homelessness crisis worse and it could also reduce the number of properties available to rent.<br\/><br\/>I know that rents are too high, that supply is still too low and that renters need greater protections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111300047#UU00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true}]
