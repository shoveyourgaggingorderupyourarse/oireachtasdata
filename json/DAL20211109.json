The catalogue of advantages they have given them include sweetheart tax deals, fast-track planning and reduced apartment design standards.  Their support for cuckoo funds pushes ordinary people out of the housing market as they gobble up family homes in bulk and rent those homes back to families at extortionate rents.<\/p>  <p>  Public anger came to boiling point earlier this year when a cuckoo fund was set to sweep up the majority of homes in a development in Maynooth from under the noses of ordinary home buyers.  Instead of taking real action to clip the wings of these funds, their response was very limp.  The stamp duty increase of 10% is easily absorbed by wealthy funds, which continue to pay zero tax on the hundreds of millions of euro they make from the outrageous rents they charge.  Of course, they excluded apartments from the stamp duty increase, which means it is still open season for cuckoo funds on more than half of the homes that are built in this city.  They literally hung the flag of surrender over Dublin for these investors.  Then the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, dropped the stamp duty increase for funds that bulk-buy family homes if they lease those homes back to local authorities.  That decision will see the State hand over &euro;1 billion to cuckoo funds.<\/p>  <p>  That was not meaningful action to put manners on these funds.  Indeed, it showed them they really have nothing to fear from the Taoiseach's Government.  When it comes to a choice between showing up for those in housing need or maintaining the power of wealthy investors, the Taoiseach has made it very clear whose side he is on.<\/p>  <p>  Now it is a case of here we go again because on Sunday we learned the Taoiseach's Ministers, Deputies Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Paschal Donohoe, are looking to dust off the red carpet again and roll it out for these funds.  As house prices continue to soar beyond the reach of ordinary workers and as extortionate rents continue to spin out of control, the Taoiseach's Ministers set out on a mission to attract in more of the very funds that wreck the housing market and rob people of an affordable roof over their heads.<\/p> <p> There is no public support for this insanity.  People want a change of direction.  They want a Government that will take the lead and build homes that workers and families can afford to buy or rent.  This is where the Taoiseach's focus and that of his Ministers should be, not on cosying up even further with cuckoo funds.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht an Taoisigh do na cuach-chist&iacute; ag spreagadh na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime tith&iacute;ochta seo.

T&aacute; daoine ag lorg rialtais at&aacute; chun tithe a th&oacute;g&aacute;il a mbeidh oibrithe agus teaghlaigh in ann iad a cheannach n&oacute; a ch&iacute;osadh.  Did the Taoiseach know about this roadshow and approve of it?  Can he tell us whom his Ministers intend to meet?  Does he know that?  What new sweetheart deals or incentives are they offering to these investors to bring them to Ireland?  It is in the public interest that details of the Ministers' proposed cuckoo fund roadshow be published urgently.  I want the Taoiseach to commit to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636466700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ar&iacute;s, n&iacute;l an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute; ag an Teachta.  N&iacute;l an ceart aici.

Is &iacute; sin an t-aon aidhm amh&aacute;in at&aacute; ag an Rialtas.  The Deputy's attempts to portray Government policy as being almost exclusively about institutional investors are very wide off the mark, disingenuous and dishonest.  The fundamental tenet of Government policy has been to provide the largest allocation in the history of the State to house construction.  Capital housing funding of more than &euro;4 billion will be provided in 2022.  That is a fact.  We are looking at providing 1,580 cost-rental homes next years by approved housing bodies, AHBs, local authorities and the Land Development Agency, LDA, at 25% below market rate.  That is what we are interested in - making sure people can either rent or buy a house at an affordable rate and, in addition, providing very substantial amounts of social housing.<\/p><p>We have introduced the new national first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme, the Rebuilding Ireland home loans scheme and the help-to-buy-schemes.  The Government has already introduced five rental Acts to help to deal with rent issues during the Covid emergency.  In addition, the Minister is bringing in legislation to reduce the level of rent increases in rent pressure zones, RPZs, to 2%.  That has been approved by Government.  Again, the aim is to seek to protect tenants in every way possible, including students, having previously dealt with the upfront payments students have to pay.  The Government has approved that Bill to cap rent increases in RPZs to no more than 2% per annum <i>pro rata<\/i>.  Project Tosaigh, providing &euro;1 billion, will enable the LDA to deliver approximately 5,000 affordable homes.  Budget 2022, as the Deputy knows, provides for the delivery of more than 11,800 social homes in 2022, of which 9,000 will be new builds.  In voids alone, 5,500 social homes have been brought back into use over the past 18 months by the Government.  A further 1,500 voids are to be remediated and brought back into use next year.<\/p><p>Why do I say all of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1636466700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Because you do not want to answer my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900004#B00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1636466700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>No.  The question is meant to be a propaganda spin, designed to portray Government housing policy as being exclusively about one thing and one thing only, which, of course, is far from the truth.

As far as the Government is concerned, and Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government for approximately a year and a half now with Fine Gael and the Green Party, we are very committed to enhancing public housing supply and also providing affordable housing in a very substantive way for the first time ever.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to institutional investment and private housing development, there has to be a private sector dimension to all of this as well.  We want private sector activity in the market but the primary intervention from Government is public housing.  The provision of record numbers of public houses is what we want to achieve.<\/p> <p>We have sent out the mandates to the local authorities to do that.  We also want to assist in the construction of affordable housing in order that ordinary people can afford to buy houses, releasing them from the significant rent pressures which many are under.<\/p> <p> Maynooth was not purchased.

It does not relate to his double, strange PCR tests.  We know we are dealing with a Covid crisis and, potentially, a Brexit Article 16 crisis.  However, if the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues cannot keep the lights on or the houses warm this winter nor plan for industry and inward investment, that is the rock on which they will perish.  I have serious concerns about this, which I have repeatedly raised.  We are facing a perfect storm in energy supply.  More than a decade ago, bad, horrendous politics and a lack of regulation in banking destroyed this country.<\/p> <p>I have a deep concern, and I do not say this lightly, about how our energy market has been regulated over the last number of years.  I would like the Taoiseach to listen to this and I would like him to look into it. <br\/><br\/>Information given to my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, shows there were seven amber alerts on 28 October.  In September, I asked the Taoiseach if he would guarantee he could keep the lights on.  He could not answer that question.  Two months later I ask him the same question.  There are a number of issues he needs to be concerned about.<br\/><br\/>Under direction from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in May, EirGrid put out a call for 200 MW of emergency power.  That will cost &euro;110 million.  The plan was for these emergency gas operators to be in place for 22 weeks.  The contract was awarded to ESB, but EirGrid messed up the tender.  Another company, Tynagh Energy threatened to go to the High Court, claiming that the procurement process run by EirGrid was anti-competitive, so the plan was abandoned.  This whole process was raised in the D&aacute;il by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Member, last week, Deputy Barry Cowan.  I want to acknowledge that he raised the process.  There are serious issues here.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who responded to Deputy Cowan last week had not a clue, basically.  We need to find out more information about how &euro;10 million was paid by EirGrid to ESB as a down payment for these emergency generators.  How did this happen?  Was it sanctioned by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan?  Where is the money now?<br\/><br\/>We also understand another tender is now being run for the same power.  This is on top of the issues raised by Mick Clifford the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>regarding Equinor calling out of offshore wind generation.  It is on top of the fact that the marine area planning Bill that is so delayed; the fact that we cannot get solar farms onto the grid; we have not made progress on microgeneration; and new technologies, such as the Silvermines hydroelectric plant in my constituency, has not proceeded. <br\/><br\/>I want to ask the Taoiseach these questions.  Will he now, two months later, guarantee that we will not have any outages of power over this winter?

Two hours before this woman died, an ambulance was en route to transport her to hospital.  In this case, the ambulance, on its way to the critically ill woman, was stood down and was diverted to care for a man with a back injury.  When the paramedics arrived, the man walked out of his home and stepped into the ambulance.  When a crew eventually arrived for the woman, she was carried out of her home by stretcher.  This was the last time that she saw her home.  The description given of the man's injury pushed him up the priority list and pushed her down.  He ticked more boxes on the ambulance service's emergency scale.  This is a preprogrammed computer system that determines patient priority.  It is a computer that decides based on a tick in a box how urgently an ambulance should arrive.  If an ambulance is on its way to a call, it can be stood down and diverted to just about anywhere, whether another town, another county or even another province.<\/p> <p>For example, a recent shift from the Thurles ambulance base started at 8 p.m.  That night crew was dispatched from Thurles to Nenagh, then back to Cashel.  The next call was to Ballingarry and they were then sent to Tullow, County Carlow, diverted to New Ross and from there to Gowran and Thomastown.  They were then sent back to Carlow town.  This involved seven and a half hours of non-stop driving and only one patient to be transferred to hospital.  While all this frantic driving was happening, Thurles was left without a service.<\/p> <p> This situation is being replicated every week as Tipperary ambulances are diverted to other regions.  Last week, for example, the south-east region operated at 50% capacity due to long-term sick leave, exhaustion and lack of staff to fill rosters.  Exhausted paramedics rush along the highways and byways of Ireland, their 12-hour shifts stretching to 15 hours and more.  They have no food breaks or downtime.  A recent study showed 50% of shifts run over their designated finish times.  This is dangerous and unsustainable.  Social media recently highlighted an ambulance crew who went off the road through fatigue at the end of their shift.  Paramedics across Ireland feel ignored and frustrated.  Many suffer from burnout and anxiety and morale is at an all-time low.  An independent review of the ambulance service is urgently required.  It needs to be conducted from the bottom up and carried out without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900007#E01600","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636468800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The concept of a national ambulance service has been developed for a number of years.  I am told and have checked that dynamic deployment allows staff in the HSE's national emergency operations centre in Tallaght to see all available resources and prioritise allocation to the higher acuity calls that require an immediate emergency response.  Judgment calls are made through a system as to which is the most severe incident and ambulances are then deployed.<\/p>  <p>  That model represents international best practice.  It has been highlighted by HIQA as a way to improve response time and national ambulance service performance generally.  That said, we hear repeated concerns from Deputies and public representatives locally about situations that have emerged in their localities.  It is always important to review how a system and service operates.  In 2021, the service received an additional &euro;10 million.  For 2022, an additional &euro;8.3 million on top of that is being allocated to modernise and build up the capacity of the service.<\/p>  <p>  There is an acknowledgement in the service that lower acuity calls - in other words, calls deemed to be less serious - have longer waiting times but in the sad case the Deputy has articulated, it seems the woman did not meet those metrics on the face of it, but actually was in a much worse condition.<\/p>  <p>  The service has provided huge backup and been involved in the Covid response.  I thank them for that; they have performed heroically throughout the pandemic.  Redeployment of approximately 45 paramedics from Covid-19-related work back to emergency ambulance duties is under way.  A further 80 paramedics are due to graduate from the National Ambulance Service College this quarter and 200 student paramedics are at different stages of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  There is a strong focus on getting the additional staff in place but the Deputy's point is about a wider review of the idea of the national service with national redeployment, as opposed to having people located in different stations around the country.  The professionals and experts in the field of emergency care are of the view that the current service is better in terms of outcomes but the experiences the Deputy has outlined deserve to be put before the National Ambulance Service team and the HSE with a view to feeding into and getting a better service and better outcomes for people locally. <\/p> <p> There is just one further point.  The community first responders scheme is important as well, and that needs to be grown again.  It was stepped down a bit due to Covid, but that also needs to be reactivated, strengthened and expanded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900008#F00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636469100,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I do not think the Taoiseach or anybody in the Government has the full facts regarding what is happening.  For example, ambulances are criss-crossing the country.  You do not have to be a genius to know that this is not efficient or cost-effective.  I will give the Taoiseach another example.  It has happened in recent weeks that an ambulance was sent from a base in Kenmare to Waterford.  An ambulance that left Kenmare, arrived in Waterford and did a call in Clonmel on the way back.  It left Clonmel for a three-and-a-half hour journey and arrived back at its base late at night.  The crew on board had done a 15-hour shift.  There is nothing logical about that.  It is ridiculous and it needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach must throw open the doors of the National Ambulance Service and scrutinise it.  We can no longer turn a blind eye to what is happening.  The current system is failing both paramedics and patients.  Together with an independent review of the service, we must also scrutinise the doctor-on-call system and look at the limited number of services provided at local injury units.  The entire system is a total fiasco.  Ambulances are waiting around with patients in them who cannot get access to hospitals and there are other patients waiting for those ambulances to arrive.  A delay in ambulances means a delay in patient services, and that must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900009#G00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1636469100,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will relay this matter to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.

There is a lot in what Deputy Lowry says, but we need to hear the overall perspective on what is the optimum model for the provision of emergency care and emergency medical practitioners.

There is a different name on it, but there is not a sign of it.  I ask this question in the context of the finite group of people who are waiting patiently for the Government's action.  Notwithstanding their courage and fortitude, former residents of mother and baby homes are becoming more anxious, worried and vulnerable with each passing day, not to mention angry.  The Government has a duty to act expeditiously, particularly in view of the background to this matter and the delay to date.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 January last, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, said that the redress scheme would be drawn up by the end of April.  An explanation was then given for the delay to the effect that there were many submissions.  Again in July, we were told that the interdepartmental group had effectively completed its work.  There was still no sign of its report, however.  Then we were told it would be in the early part of the new term.  We are now in the middle of the new term, and there is not a sign of the report.  Will the Taoiseach tell me when details of the redress scheme will be published and accessible to those who are waiting, Uimhir a haon, and; No. 2, what communication has the Taoiseach had with the religious orders regarding their participation in the amount of money needed to fund the scheme?<\/p> <p> We have seen the report on television on Sunday night, to be broadcast tonight on RT&Eacute;, in regard to Tuam, which is intimately connected with this question.  More than four years ago, an expert team went in and looked at it in response to the commission of investigation, which had a press release saying there were substantial human remains there.  The expert team went in and one member is quoted in the documentary as saying: \"I have never walked away from human remains in that context.\"  Their work was a scoping exercise to see what was there.  They temporarily protected the site for six months and nothing has happened four years later.<\/p> <p> We are sitting here today after a series of mistakes and delays.  A report from the commission that was in the Government&rsquo;s offices from October last year was only published in January of this year and was never given to the former residents until afterwards, and so on.  There is a whole list of other delays and obfuscations, not to mention the tapes and the press release saying they had been destroyed when, subsequently, it was found they had not been.<\/p> <p> I am conscious I am over time, but given that background, it is extremely important that the Taoiseach gives us a date today so we can have confidence and hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900009#G00400","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636469400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as an gceist seo a ard&uacute; &oacute; thaobh m&aacute;ithreacha agus leana&iacute;, na sc&eacute;ime c&uacute;itimh agus an tsu&iacute;omh i dTuaim.

It was informed by consultation with survivors which took place during March and April, with a very strong response received to that consultation process.  The Minister then considered that further and made proposals.  The development of the scheme is a key priority for us.  The Minister will be bringing a scheme to Cabinet shortly and there are consultations with the leaders of the parties now, and with the other Ministers, and I expect that this will be brought before Cabinet fairly quickly now, within the next number of weeks, if not sooner.<\/p>  <p>  We are anxious to get the balance right and to devise and approve a scheme that would be responsive to the survivors of mother and baby homes and county homes.  I accept the delay is one to be regretted but, nonetheless, since the decision was made by Government to develop such a scheme, the Minister has applied himself to this very diligently, has worked with the groups concerned and has interacted with Government Departments and with external bodies as well from a human rights perspective.  We do understand the importance of this and it will come to Government very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Tuam, as the Deputy knows, the Minister and I would view it as imperative to afford the children buried at Tuam the dignity in death that has so long been denied them.  He did prioritise the drafting of the proposed Bill.  It is a very complex piece of legislation.  That said, it went for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in January 2021.  Numerous submissions were made to the joint Oireachtas committee and a number of people gave powerful and moving testimony.  The committee published its report on the legislation in July.  The Minister is now carefully considering the recommendations from that process.  His intention, following that consultation, is to publish the Bill by the end of the current parliamentary session and bring it through the legislative process as quickly as possible.  He is going to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900010#H00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1636469400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Thank you, Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900010#H00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1636469400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Third, I just want to make the point on the proposed legislation on birth information and tracing.

The reform of July or summer provision also needs to be seriously addressed given that only 20% of eligible students had access to the programme in the past year.  I welcome progress made on the school meals programme.  Not every child has access to two or three meals per day and a school setting provides an opportunity in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I have to mention school transport.  We speak about this issue in the House every summer and it is one that we dread as September approaches.  It is another aspect of education we need to address.  Autism spectrum disorder, ASD, designation for schools is a nettle that we need to firmly grasp by removing from principals and boards of management the discretion to determine whether a school has an ASD class.

The report published yesterday by the Tallaght Drug and Alcohol Task Force demonstrates the urgency of this commitment and starkly highlights the devastation addiction causes for family and communities.  Demand for task force services in Tallaght has doubled over the past decade and this reality is replicated throughout this State.  Despite this, task force funding remains at pre-2008 levels.  The autonomy of task forces has also been radically reduced since the HSE took over funding them in 2015.  This policy decision has stymied the ability of local task forces to respond effectively to localised challenges.  The HSE does not understand the mission of the task force network.  Accessing funding, which is limited, continues to be too difficult and slow and does not recognise local need.  I am especially concerned for the North Inner City Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, as the Department of Health, with the assistance of the HSE, is actively pushing out community and voluntary members.

We need a referendum to amend Article 41 of the Constitution.  The way in which families come together has changed and family units are different in modern Ireland.

These couples pay tax on everything together, but when it comes to the State looking after them in their hour of need, they are discriminated against.  The Citizens' Assembly has taken a view on this, which is good.  However, we need to see action on a referendum on Article 41 and changing the position in the laws we bring in here.

Deputy P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan, who tabled one of the questions, called for a citizens' assembly on education.  That would be useful.  Other mechanisms have been used in the past, such as the National Education Convention where all the various partners in education convened for a general discussion in seeking out information on educational policy more generally.<\/p>  <p>  Measures were taken in the budget to expand the schools meals programme.  I accept that scheme can go further.  There is a review under way on school transport.  My view, in the context of the Government decision to halve the cost of public transport for younger people, is that in addition to all the other metrics that are used, we should look at school transport now through the prism of climate change.  I have made this point to the Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley, as well as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  School transport is a complex scheme that has evolved over the years.  It seems to me that having more kids on buses and fewer parents driving cars to schools, where that is feasible and possible, is part of the climate change agenda.  I have asked that this be fed into the review of school transport that is under way in the Department of Education.<\/p>  <p>  All schools should provide for children with special needs, as should all organisations, including those in the voluntary sector.  Many schools are not State owned.  As regards special schools and so on, the idea that schools will not accept a class or additional pupils has grown and that has to stop.  The State will provide additional places and funding for them.  Given that we have had mainstream special education over the last 25 years, it is important, particularly at post-primary level, that everybody is on board with inclusivity, as well as with facilitating access to schools for children with special needs.  That needs to happen.  The Government is working towards achieving that.<\/p>  <p>  There are other issues with the examination review.  There have been number of reviews of the leaving certificate.  The leaving certificate of today is much different from what it was 25 years ago.  There has been incremental change.  The big challenge has always been to balance the anonymity of the process, whereby it is not who you are or who you are connected to but, rather, results that matter.  That is a good thing.  On the other hand, the leaving certificate facilitates rote learning to an excess.  There needs to be reforms around the leaving certificate assessment model.  The national qualifications framework, NFQ, provides opportunities for all students, irrespective of points and so on, to access their course or programme via different routes.  That should ultimately be the optimal way forward.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised a sad and unacceptable incident that took place in Fermoy where a woman was attacked and sexually assaulted.  I hope the person is brought to justice for that assault.  The Deputy also raised the issue of gender-based violence.  The recent Citizens' Assembly on gender equality produced recommendations on which the Government will follow through.  We are not blocking any sex education Bill.  However, there is an important exercise under way involving the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and interested parties.  It is a review of the sexuality in education programme in primary schools and second level schools.  It is important that it be informed by experts and that we get a proper, up-to-date, modern programme for sexuality education in our schools.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Kelly's point, we need a Citizens' Assembly on drugs.  As I said earlier, I believe we need a broader response.  I have asked officials to draw up a broader programme on areas of disadvantage, not only around drugs but deprivation more generally and creating pathways for people and progression within areas of disadvantage.  Funding of about &euro;6 million has been allocated to the national drug and alcohol strategy this year.  A further &euro;1 million will be allocated and we will look at whether we can do more.

Forestry is key in this, as has been said on a number of occasions.

The Taoiseach, quite insultingly, tried to cast aspersions on the veracity of what I said but then said he would look into the matter.

I am glad to say that I got a call from Coillte this morning stating that it had decided, although the sale was at an advanced stage, to abandon it.  That is a victory.  It also subsequently suggested that it was not really going to sell this forestry, even though there were \"For Sale\" signs everywhere and, as of this morning, it was advertised on the website of an estate agent.

The Act was commenced on 31 October 2019 and the fund was subsequently seeded with &euro;1.5 billion transferred from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on 15 November 2019.<\/p> <p>Today, I am seeking the D&aacute;il's endorsement for a motion not to transfer the &euro;500 million contribution for 2021 into the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund.  Deputies will be aware that, under section 5(2) of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019, the Minister for Finance is required to make a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;500 million to the rainy day fund every year from 2019 to 2023.  The Act also provides, under section 6, that in any given year the Minister for Finance may make a proposal to the D&aacute;il not to transfer the &euro;500 million contribution into the fund.  I am proposing the motion that the Minister for Finance not transfer &euro;500 million into the rainy day fund in 2021, following Cabinet approval on Wednesday, 27 October last.<\/p> <p> The motion is before the House because the Minister for Finance is satisfied that, by reason of the continuation of the exceptional circumstances posed by the pandemic and the consequential public expenditure undertaken to remedy or mitigate the impact of Covid-19, the making of the payment of the prescribed amount would place an undue burden on the public finances.  As everyone in the Chamber is aware, 2021 has seen the continuation of unprecedented challenges to the State in terms of the Covid-19 pandemic.  As anyone would expect, the Irish people and, for its part, the Government acting in their name, have continued to respond to these challenges with steadfast resolve while deploying massive resources.  The last one and a half years have been extraordinarily difficult for all, with disruption to family life, the pain of losing loved ones and the impact of successive, but necessary, public health restrictions all hindering, in an unprecedented way, normal economic and social life.<\/p> <p> Despite this, throughout the pandemic, we have all witnessed the incredible resilience of the Irish people.  Ordinary people, business owners and especially our front-line workers have risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.  In particular, I am sure that everyone in the Chamber will join me in acknowledging all those who supported and partook in our vaccination programme.  It gives me an enormous sense of pride to say that this vaccine programme has been one of the most successful in the world.  It is the key reason we are returning to greater degrees of normality.  Given these facts, we all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the staff and volunteers involved across the relevant agencies.<\/p> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly highlighted the role of Government in supporting both our economy and society.  While the response from the Government was unparalleled, with over &euro;48 billion provided over three years, it was also completely necessary.  Approximately &euro;41 billion of this, or nearly one fifth of national income as measured by GNI*, was made available in 2020 and 2021.  This included direct public expenditure, tax expenditures and &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; supports such as loans and guarantees, including funds allocated for 2022.  Through the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, approximately &euro;17.5 billion has been directed to individuals, families and businesses.  These supports worked and showed that we responded in the right way and at the right time.  Ireland's ability to respond was strengthened by the solidarity of our European Union partners.  We must also acknowledge that our ability to respond was made possible because we managed our affairs well in better times in order to be able to give support at a time of great national difficulty.<\/p> <p> Thankfully, we have now entered a new phase where we intend to recover from the pandemic, restore our public services and living standards and repair our public finances.  Earlier this year, and very positively, we passed a crucial milestone with the return of many people to workplaces.  In many cases, they were doing so for the first time in 18 months.  As the recovery increasingly takes hold and citizens get back to some level of normality, the Government must remain focused on our elevated debt levels.  At the end of 2020, the stock of Government national debt stood at &euro;217.9 billion, an increase of almost &euro;14 billion.  General Government debt as a share of GDP increased to 58.4% of GDP in 2020, an increase of 1.2%.  For 2021, it is projected to be 55.2%.  General Government debt to GNI*, which is viewed as a more appropriate indicator of the repayment capacity of the economy, increased to 104.7% in 2020.  This is an increase of 10% and it is expected to increase again in 2021, reaching 106.2% in 2021.<\/p> <p> Public finances can absorb this shock, letting debt rise in order to provide support to the economy, but the debt-to-income ratio must be put on a downward trajectory once circumstances allow.  Market participants have given Ireland the benefit of the doubt as a result of the prudent fiscal policies implemented in recent years.  Nonetheless, Ireland's public debt-to-income ratio is among the highest in the developed world.  By 2024, our stock of public debt will reach just under &euro;240 billion, or a quarter of a trillion euro.<\/p> <p> The summer economic statement set out a pathway to meet the core objectives set out in the programme for Government.  The strategy was reaffirmed by budget 2022 in October and involves investing in the economy and society and reducing the deficit in order to underpin the sustainability of the public finances.  In general terms, the pandemic has entered a new phase, so fiscal strategy must evolve along with it.<\/p> <p>The strategy involves three strands: pandemic-related supports will be unwound as appropriate over the course of the remainder of 2021 and during 2022; expenditure will be targeted in priority areas such as capital expenditure in support of climate action; and budgetary policy will be anchored within a medium-term framework via an expenditure rule.  The expenditure rule involves limiting core spending growth to around the same level of trend growth in the economy via fixed expenditure ceilings.  The headline deficit will be allowed to fluctuate while keeping the ceilings fixed.  The strategy will allow the Government to return the public finances to a stable path, while maintaining key investment in public services, particularly public capital investment.  Vitally, by next year, the country will only be borrowing for capital expenditure purposes.<\/p> <p> The most recent Exchequer returns show a deficit of &euro;7.4 billion was recorded in October, representing an improvement of some &euro;4.2 billion on the same period last year, driven by increases in tax revenue.  On a 12-month rolling basis, which is a better indicator of the trend, the Exchequer recorded a deficit of just under &euro;8.1 billion.  Tax revenues of &euro;50.9 billion were collected to the end of October, ahead of target by &euro;3.8 billion, or 8.1%, and up by &euro;8.3 billion, or 19.6%, on the same period last year.  Income tax and corporation tax continue to perform well, driven respectively by the reduction in unemployment and rising wages, as well as high corporate profitability.  Moreover, VAT receipts and, to a lesser extent, excise duties have recovered strongly as the economy opened up.<\/p> <p> Total gross voted expenditure stood at &euro;67.5 billion to end-October, which was &euro;2.5 billion, or 3.5%, below profile.  The majority of this relates to an underspend in capital expenditure, driven by the extended shutdown of the construction industry in the first few months of this year.  Nevertheless, total gross voted expenditure to the end of October was &euro;2 billion ahead of the same period last year, driven by increased spending in the Department of Social Protection, primarily due to the ongoing cost of the PUP and EWSS pandemic support schemes.<\/p> <p> The summer economic statement projected that the general Government deficit would be around &euro;20 billion this year.  Given the significant over-performance in taxes and the underspend in voted expenditure versus profile, this projection was revised downwards in budget 2022 to around &euro;13 billion, or just under 6% of GNI*, or 3% of GDP, this year.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, given the likely continuing impact of Covid-19 on the public finances, it was clear from earlier this year that the making of the planned &euro;500 million annual contribution to the rainy day fund was unlikely and this was signalled in the April 2021 stability programme update and the summer economic statement.  As Deputies will know, the rationale behind establishing the rainy day fund in 2019, which was the subject of broad support across the political system, was to accumulate funding that could be deployed in the event of an adverse shock to the economy.<\/p> <p> The establishment of this fund and its availability for drawdown in support of budget 2021 in October 2020 have proven to be correct decisions.  The drawdown receipt by the Exchequer was used to offset funding requirements arising from budget 2021 and the need to support the increase in Covid-19 related expenditure.  It was important that the fund was there to support the Government's Covid response.  Crucially, using the rainy day fund meant that the State was able to provide for additional Covid-19 measures without having to borrow more, saving the burden of repayment or refinancing costs on future generations.  This motion not to pay the annual &euro;500 million contribution into the rainy day fund, while not preferable, is necessary in order to ensure that the Exchequer has access to funds when they are most needed.  The Minister for Finance wants to be in a position to add funds to the rainy day fund at some point in the future in order to be in a position to deal with potential future economic crises but to do so as the public financial impact of the pandemic continues does not make sense.  I commend the motion to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900022#V01200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636476600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>This motion authorises the Minister for Finance, in accordance with section 6(1) of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019, not to pay the prescribed amount of &euro;500 million into the national surplus reserve fund for 2021.  This relates to the so-called rainy day fund which was established by Fine Gael to burnish its image as a prudent manager of the public finances and which was championed by Fianna F&aacute;il in an attempt to restore trust in its ability to manage the public finances after it torpedoed the Irish economy a decade ago.  I support the motion.  It would be foolish to divert resources into the fund when we still face the challenges posed by the pandemic, while our hospitals and patients suffer unacceptable waiting lists, while the housing crisis deepens and  while climate breakdown confronts us.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that despite being established in June 2019 this fund never really got off the ground and it lies empty.  Some &euro;1.5 billion was transferred from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in 2019 and spent in response to the pandemic.  We should not fool ourselves or anyone else for that matter; that money could have been spent directly from the ISIF without being pit-stopped into the so-called rainy day fund.  Under the legislation, &euro;500 million was to be transferred into the fund each year from the Exchequer, including in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.  No money was transferred from the Exchequer in 2019, 2020 or 2021.  There has always been something more pressing for which the &euro;500 million of resources has been needed and so the fund is empty.<\/p>  <p>  When the legislation was first debated I said that it was already raining.  We have a housing crisis that is damaging the fabric of our society and the competitiveness of our economy.  It is also burning, with a climate crisis that requires significant supply side investment to provide alternatives for low and middle income households.  It was always my suspicion that the rainy day fund was more of an electoral gimmick than a serious innovation in fiscal policy.  It was established shortly before a general election and was often touted as a great example of prudence together with a budget surplus in 2019.  Every time we have debated these motions since then the two have been mentioned together by the Minister for Finance or by Government Deputies.  The surplus that year was achieved due to an unexpected bumper receipt of corporate taxes, not as a result of budget policy.  Boasting of a surplus at a time when the housing crisis was deepening is not an example of sound fiscal policy but of poor economic management.  The housing crisis is after all a result of the fiscal and economic policy of this and previous Governments.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will support this motion.  We suspect that the Minister for Finance will ask us to do the exact same thing as in this motion next year and that the fund will still lie empty and idle.  Given the debate this allows, I mention fiscal policy more broadly.  The object of same should not just be to reach a certain number to one or two decimal places and then to wave that number around to the electorate in the hope of admiration.  The object of fiscal policy must be to achieve economic and social outcomes.  In too many areas the economy is failing.  The housing crisis is damaging lives as well as our competitiveness.  Childcare costs are hurting families as well as female participation in the workforce.  A neglect of research, innovation and higher education has not only restricted employment opportunities but it has hampered the productivity of indigenous enterprises.  In those areas we must do better and we can do so provided we have the right Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900024#X00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1636476600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Given the exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves arising from the Covid pandemic, as my colleague, Deputy Doherty, outlined, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the motion.  A large volume of public expenditure was required to ameliorate the impact of Covid-19 and this was necessary to prevent the worst.  This means that the &euro;500 million annual contribution for transfer from the Exchequer to the national surplus reserve fund, or the so-called rainy day fund, to be made this year will place an unnecessary burden on the public finances and as per section 6(1) of the Act the Minister for Finance is allowed to make this proposal to avoid making the annual &euro;500 million contribution into the national reserve fund.  The Minister for Finance is right to do that.  It is obvious that it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to divert badly needed resources away from fighting the pandemic and it would be a needless risk to do such a thing, especially when case numbers are rising in our hospitals and when our public services are under huge pressure.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth mentioning that when this so called rainy day fund came into existence Sinn F&eacute;in voiced concerns on it.  When it was proposed and introduced in 2019 my party submitted amendments so that the fund could be used for the purposes of investing in housing, infrastructure and climate actions.  At that time our amendments were either ruled out of order or opposed.  It is said that hindsight is 20\/20 but it should be obvious that the then Government was wrong to do that at the time.  The housing crisis has become worse, our public infrastructure has fallen further into disrepair and our climate targets seem further out of reach.<\/p>  <p>  We were so vulnerable going into this pandemic because of our infrastructural deficit which is due to years of underinvestment.  The Government's national development plan clearly acknowledges that we need to make a massive infrastructural investment, particularly in the area of green investment.  From our current vantage point it seems that these funds should be allowed to be used for these purposes.  When this legislation was introduced the then Government also allowed the fund to be used for the purpose of a capital injection into the banking sector, something we found objectionable.  Given the amount of losses the banks could carry forward, meaning they would be paying tax for decades, this seemed like a poor use of funds.  Moreover we are seeing an exodus of banks and the Government continues to sit on its hands in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  We know the rainy day fund is empty.  The money that had been transferred to it from the ISIF had been spent fighting the pandemic but it was not applicable for the other crises we face.  Our housing is in a worse state than it was when the fund was set up, we have longer waiting lists and in recent weeks we have seen over 700 people on trolleys in our hospitals in the western region after the Government told us time and again last year that it was putting huge investment into our hospitals.  What has changed for those people who see family members lying on trolleys night after night and day after day?  We need to make a serious investment if we want to reach our climate targets.  That means we need investment in our public infrastructure and that we cannot continue in a situation whereby the Government is cutting the number of buses.  We need more buses and more public infrastructure.  People are struggling to buy a house or to cover the cost of rent and thousands are languishing on waiting lists.  It seems that for those people when it rains it pours but it has been pouring for a hell of a long time and it continues to do so.  We need to ensure that the necessary investment is made in all aspects of our infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900024#X00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1636477200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The so-called rainy day fund was established in 2018 and for reasons that are fairly obvious at this point in time, only one instalment of &euro;500 million was paid into the fund.  That was in 2019.  The right thing to do was to use that &euro;500 million to help fight the pandemic and to support jobs and business through the most difficult of years.  We are, again, as the House knows only too well, in very dangerous territory and it is right that no money is paid into the fund this year either.  We are all agreed, at least for this year, that there are better ways to allocate this money in 2022 and, indeed, more urgent matters that we need to address as a society as we battle through this difficult time.<\/p>  <p>  When the legislation to establish the fund was taken by this House, the Labour Party opposed it.  We opposed also the motion to direct the first tranche of &euro;500 million into the fund in the first year of its operation in 2019, not because we do not believe that we should budget responsibly and organise our economic affairs sensibly.  We opposed the rationale of the fund in the first place because we believe there should be no need for it if the economy is managed well, sustainably and productively.<\/p>  <p>  It would be wrong-headed and unconscionable to set aside in one year the kind of money that could build several thousand homes when so many of our citizens need the security of a decent long-term roof over their heads.  I appreciate the view of the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that the idea of a rainy day fund is in the interests of the prudent management of the economy.  That is their perspective and they are entitled to hold that perspective, but let us put the experience of 2018 and 2019, when the fund first came into being, in some kind of context.  That was a time when &euro;500 million was being funnelled into the fund yet the 2016-2020 Government, supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming's party, was paying for cost overruns in the HSE with corporation tax windfalls.  Similarly, massive sums of money not budgeted for had to be found to fund cost overruns in the national children's hospital project.  Protecting the economy and our citizens from black swan moments is in the long run better achieved by making investment in public goods such as housing, education, childcare, training and primary healthcare now, not by putting half a billion euro of taxpayers' money a year into an account no matter what the weather.  It is public investment, first and foremost, that will prime our economy for the kind of sustainable growth that can make our society more resilient to the kind of shocks we experienced in 2020 and 2021.  The idea that we pumped half a billion euro into a fund for the future while at the same time seeing cost overruns get out of control before our very eyes on many high profile public projects did not sit well with me or with the general public.  Quite rightly, it drives people mad to see how the State is constantly on the hook, low-balled and taken for a ride by big contractors for overruns on big projects such as the children's hospital.<\/p>  <p>  If this Government really wants to see the State better insulated and better prepared for all eventualities, a good place to start is by ensuring better value for money and oversight in real time of public spending - something that we do not seem able to achieve in this country.  The Minister of State could also agree to raise additional sustained revenue to build up our public services through targeted wealth and asset taxes on those who can most afford it.  Tax seems to be a dirty word for this Government but we need to talk about tax.  Mark my words, this is something we will have to return to very soon.  This would bring real sustainability to the public finances and make Ireland fairer and better prepared to withstand any future shocks than any rainy day fund might.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900025#Y00100","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1636477200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important motion.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, for his introductory remarks.  I appreciate the contributions of all Deputies opposite, as we repeat a discussion that was held 12 months ago.  At the time, I stated my concern that while this is an understandable move, it is a disappointing one because I fundamentally believe the creation of the rainy day fund was sensible even though we did not get the full chance to see the worth of it before, unfortunately, that rainy day fund was drawn down.  We have seen how important it was to have.<\/p>  <p>  When initially this was thought up, the main threat envisaged was a no-deal Brexit and the impact that would have on our economy.  No one would have dreamed back in 2018 of the impact of a once-in-a-century global pandemic the likes of which we are still living with.  If we look at the response to that global pandemic, what has been achieved and what has been put in place over the past 18 months, it is testament to the sound financial footing that the State was in.  We see the co-ordinated efforts between European Union member states to realise new capital through the formation of eurobonds to pool together in order to procure vaccines at the best possible price was downright good decent sense about economic planning.  We look at the State's commitment to tackling the Covid response and the fact it was able to draw on various financial tools and the sound economic footing the State's coffers had been brought back into.  It is something for which the Government, and particularly the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who cannot be here with us, deserves credit.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the preparation for Brexit and the response that we have seen on a domestic level in preparing for Brexit in terms of investing and diversifying, and the collective European Union approach in the Brexit adjustment reserve fund of which Ireland has achieved the lion's share, there are practical implications for this.  We see one of those practical implications today, of all days, with &euro;70 million announced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, directly for the agrifood sector to allow our producers to diversify in markets.  I remember, way back when, talking about Brexit debates.  We realised that 86% of our cheddar cheese exports were going to Great Britain and how that simply would not be sustainable if we were trading less and less with the British economy.  That is why we are seeing this diversification announced today and are seeing it being realised.  Government talked about it but Government actually backed-up and is providing the supports for industry to make sure industry can continue to produce high-quality diversified goods for new markets.  We are looking at new markets within, but also through, the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I suppose we have to remember that Brexit, despite the assertions of the current British Prime Minister, is not done.  Brexit is not done based on one treaty.  Brexit is not done based on one Act.  Brexit and its ramifications will be with us for at least a generation.  We see, even this week, how that continues to play out.<\/p>  <p>  Much like Brexit is far from done, and it will be with us for many years to come, we understand that the Covid pandemic is far from over.  That is not only based on rising infection rates or the pressures on our public health system.  If we look at the impact on the economy, so many areas of the economy and, indeed, society simply have not got back to where they want to be.  They will not necessarily get back to where they were before and perhaps they can go to a better model.  The supports that have been provided for by this Government working with stakeholders and with European Union partners have been so important in keeping those aspects of the economy and society going and ensuring that businesses were able to reopen and get back into the workplace in due course.  When discussing this fund and the motion it is important to state that we look to the future.  I am heartened by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming's comments in relation to the overall budgetary and financial outlook for the Irish economy in the coming months and, indeed, years.  It apes many of the statements that were made by the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, when we debated the budget last week.<\/p>  <p>  When we are talking about the potential and likely economic growth of the State, it is important we state that although no funds are being put into the so-called rainy day fund by way of this motion, we maintain the option to do that going forward and maintain the commitment that we will work back up the rainy day fund because, despite assertions of others opposite, this is not some sort of image.  This is real money that had a real impact on so many lives.  This is real money that is needed.  It is simply good management.  Any household always has a reserve.  It is no different with an economy or a society.  It is the responsibility of every legislator in this House to make sure that we have a rainy day fund and that when circumstances allow it the appropriate funds are put into this account because it is raining at present and it will be raining again.<\/p>  <p>  Having this sort of sensible economic outlook will underline everything that can be done in every sector of life.  It does not take away from capital or current expenditure on the maintenance of our economy and the betterment of society.  This is something that provides that guarantee or level of insurance that all of us deem so important.  That is why it is not good enough to say that we are deferring payment and bringing this motion to the House, following it being passed by the Cabinet.<\/p> <p>We need to hear the commitment in the Minister of State's summing up remarks that the Government will build the rainy day fund back up and prepare for future eventualities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900025#Y00200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636477800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The National Surplus Act came into force in June 2019 to establish the contingency reserve for exceptional circumstances, or rainy day fund.  We all agree we are living in exceptional circumstances.  It is most definitely raining.  The housing crisis this Government is presiding over is evidence of that.  In fact, it is a torrential downpour as we can see from the state of the health service.  Operations are being cancelled and Covid is not being used as an excuse this time.  Waiting lists are getting longer and medical cards, GP and dental appointments cannot be got for love nor money.  The health service is in disarray and it is not by accident.  The public health service was deliberately run down by successive Governments to make the private health service more attractive.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will abolish the two-tier health system favoured by the parties that make up this Government and by the Labour Party.  We will put patients first and give our healthcare workers an all-Ireland health service that everyone can be proud of.  As Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said earlier, when this legislation originally came through the House, Sinn F&eacute;in submitted amendments so that the fund will be used to invest in housing infrastructure and climate action.  These amendments were ruled out of order or were opposed.  Instead, the Government included a section that allowed the fund to be used for a capital injection into the banking sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will put ordinary workers and families ahead of profits or private companies.<\/p>  <p>  The rainy day fund has turned out to be a bit of a damp squib.  By now, we should have &euro;3 billion in it, but it is empty.  We need to spend this money wisely.  We need to stop funding an over-heated private rental market with HAP and start building public homes on public land.  We need to stop pouring money into private hospitals through the National Treatment Purchase fund and start reforming our health system to ensure that it is fit for the 21st century.  I sincerely hope that is what happens. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900026#Z00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1636477800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I am happy to contribute to this debate.  I do not have any difficulty with the motion in front of us.  It would not make sense in the present exceptional circumstances to allocate &euro;500 million to a rainy day fund but it has not made a lot of sense up to now either.  Deputy Richmond said that any sensible household puts money away in a rainy day fund but you do not do that when there is a hole in the roof and you need to replace the roof.  Essentially for several years now there has been the equivalent of a hole in the roof, whether that is the health crisis, in terms of the capacity of our health service, the housing crisis or many other aspects of the dysfunction within our country.  It is not the case that everyone was in favour of this from the beginning.<\/p>  <p>  I notice the Minister of State did not speak at all about his thinking or the Government's thinking about the future of the rainy day fund and what the intention is.  To have such a fund is very well where a country has sorted out its public services and its economy is in a very healthy state and its people are all doing well and prospering.  In circumstances like that, where there is a surplus, it makes sense but we have not been in that position in this country and it is hard to see us being in that position for the foreseeable future.  That is not only as a result of the exceptional circumstances that we are in now.  Obviously, the big issue now is the hugely negative impact of Covid on the country and that is the immediate reason for not proceeding with the allocation of &euro;500 million, but we have to ask what questions have been learned from Covid.  <\/p>  <p>  I echo the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on what has happened in this country over the last two years in terms of the huge level of personal family tragedies and the very significant number of people who have passed away.  I echo the condolences to them.  There have been more than 500,000 cases now.  We think of all those whose lives have been damaged in so many ways.  We recognise the huge efforts that have been made by everyone working within the health service, and by those in other front-line jobs in areas such as retail, deliveries and in so many other areas of our society.  We think of all those who kept things going, who kept the show on the road, sometimes at huge cost to themselves.  It is important to acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge the fact that the experience of Covid over almost two years has shown up huge weaknesses in the way we run our country and the Government&rsquo;s approach to the economy generally and the neglect of so many aspects of our public services right across the board.  Some of us have been committed to proper levels of investment in public services throughout our political careers.  You have to ask what lessons this Government has learned by the very substantial weaknesses in things such as capacity within our health service, our dysfunctional housing system, the dysfunctional childcare system and the way in which we fund, or under-fund, all levels of our education system.  What lessons have been learned?  It was very clear that if the country was to survive at all over the last two years that there had to be very significant intervention by the Government in taking over the use of private hospitals, for example, or taking on the payment of salaries for childcare workers.  All these things were exposed as being dysfunctional in an emergency situation.  There seems to be an attitude that when we get over all of this, we will go back to the old ways of doing things.  Clearly that is not sustainable.  I would be much more reassured if I heard the Minister of State and other Ministers speak of the lessons that have been learned.<\/p>  <p>  The figure of &euro;500 million is coincidentally the same figure as the Government decided to spend on tax cuts, which are in the main regressive cuts in the recent budget and which was not a very wise way of spending money.

I welcome the opportunity to examine it.  I will be supporting the motion which will authorise the Minister for Finance to not allocate &euro;500 million to the rainy day fund for 2021.   The action is prudent given the very exceptional circumstances created by the Covid-19 pandemic.  A similar motion under section 6 of the National Surplus Act 2019 was proposed last year in the context of the pandemic and in 2019 because of Brexit.  Given the international economic environment, returns on investments are minimal and the &euro;500 million will be better spent being invested here in Ireland.  That said, the medium-term benefits of building a counter-cyclical fund remain.  The macro economic outlook for next year is very positive and in those circumstances I would like to see the payments resume in the future.  It is important we prudently set aside funds during the good times for future challenges.  We have mentioned challenge of Brexit.  Who was to know that something would surpass Brexit?  It was the issue of the time, and remains a significant challenge for this country, but then along came the pandemic and really put us to the test.  However, the Government moved quickly, and rightly so, at the outset of the pandemic to provide funds.  The Minister of State said it required &euro;48 billion to deal with the pandemic and to fund front-line Departments, local authorities and agencies to ensure the continuity of public services, protect incomes and re-imagine the public realm.<\/p>  <p>  The work of officials and staff at the Department of Social Protection in particular should be noted.  They reacted overnight, ensuring more than half a million workers had access to pandemic unemployment payment.  I also want to acknowledge the actions of Revenue in dealing with companies and all their queries about employees and themselves.<\/p> <p>The response of the Revenue Commissioners was exemplary, especially in the early and middle parts of last year, and should be acknowledged.  Local authorities also moved quickly to improve the public realm, installing public toilets, bins, outdoor seating, etc., and providing all sorts of other services.  I encourage local authorities to retain improvements that have worked and engage in meaningful public consultation, which is key in this regard.<\/p> <p> However, now the acute phase of the pandemic has passed - I hope it is behind us - it is important we resume normal procurement practices to ensure taxpayers' money is spent prudently.  This is particularly important given the increase in costs for construction projects and services.  I join the Minister of State in expressing condolences to those who passed away during the pandemic.  This is not all about money.  This is about the impact it has had on society, families, workers and businesses across the country.  We must remember that when we are discussing finance in this House.

As Deputies will know, we rejected the Act after our proposals on housing, for example, were rejected and it was decided the capital injection could be used for banking, the most over-injected, overindulged, perennially pampered sector in the State and one that still pays no tax.  Given that we are dealing with a full-blown and unprecedented public health emergency, we need to ensure our hospitals and other public services are as well funded as possible.<\/p>  <p>  We can all see the crisis in our hospitals.  At Naas General Hospital, healthcare workers are out on their feet but they keep going.  The HSE, in a reply to a parliamentary question, indicated there are over 100 vacancies at Naas General Hospital.  From speaking to nurses, it seems the only thing keeping doctors, nurses and healthcare workers going at the moment is the solidarity they show each other.  When it comes to the rainy day fund we absolutely agree it is already bucketing down but when it comes to housing, childcare, carers, ventilating schools, supporting people through a just transition and the climate crisis, the monsoon arrived a long time ago.  There is a huge amount of work to be done so that we do not create a divide between the climate haves and have-nots.  The Minister for Finance took umbrage at the mention of words \"undermining democracy\" but I can tell the Government that if it allows inequality to take hold, it will present a real danger to social cohesion.  People cannot be excluded from transitioning well and comfortably simply due to money.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the issue of housing, instead of looking after the vulture funds and planning punitive roadshows to entice more of them to come here, we should be looking after their prey, the workers in this State who are despairing of ever being able to either rent or buy an affordable home.  With all the talk of biodiversity, the vulture is in no fear of extinction in this country.  While the vulture funds are allowed a clean sweep, the biodiversity of ordinary people trying to buy houses has collapsed.  This biodiversity and habitats disaster is unlikely to be addressed by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, at COP26 but it is true all the same.<\/p>  <p>  I am equally concerned about our carers, who have suffered hugely throughout the pandemic.  Sinn F&eacute;in has set a clear path for recognising and assist them.  I am all for pupils, teachers and the wider school staff.  The State has signed up to the EU buildings directive which would vastly improve ventilation in our schools for health and safety reasons.  It is beyond me that this fund is not being used to fast-track funding for investment in design, which is desperately needed.  Covid might not be a problem for a rainy day but a rainy season.  As a result of diversion, funds are not available for what is essential for the people as opposed to essential for the Government and its preferred projects and sectors.  The issue with the rainy day fund is not just money but the priorities for spending that money.  That is the difference between the Government and the Opposition.

We need to look at our health system from a point of view of doing all that can be done at this point in time.

All these tools need to be put in place.  We are in a period of living with Covid so we need to do all that is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Major issues still need to be dealt with, especially from a capital expenditure point of view.  It goes without saying we are in the middle of a housing crisis and the only way to get to the crux of the problem is to address the supply of affordable housing.

As I have said previously, we need the Government to address those parts of these crises that it can address.  The European Union and other bigger players have greater wriggle room than we have for dealing with some of these issues.  Turning off the tap in Russia cannot be sorted out by this State.  I also accept that we are not sure of what the implications will be if the British Government triggers Article 16 or if doing so would be just another means of negotiating.  We do not know to what the end result will be but we need to take action in relation to what we can.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about huge expenditure on the national development plan and necessary works.  I am worried and perturbed that of the &euro;5.1 billion to be spent on roads over a decade, &euro;1 billion will be spent in the first five years.  This means the business end will be in the second five years of the decade.  However, we have all accepted that we action at the business end on climate change and carbon budgets will also come in the second half of this decade.  For this reason, we need to have a more realistic conversation on what needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900027#AA00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1636478400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which I support.  The Government should not transfer &euro;500 million into the national surplus reserve fund in 2021.  We are in a period of great crisis.  Society, including the business community, has suffered great financial hardship because of Covid-19.  Unfortunately, I fear we will feel the effects of this pandemic for a long time to come.  In times like this, we need to invest in infrastructure and services.  This is not a time for investing in rainy day funds.  We invest in rainy day funds so that we will have funds and resources in times of great need.  Now is a time of great need.  We need to invest in our infrastructure and services.  I am calling on the Government not only to suspend payments into the national surplus reserve fund but to use the funds to invest in our infrastructure and services.<\/p>  <p>  Last week in the House, I highlighted the fact that the most recent GeoView report, in 2020, showed there were 92,251 vacant addresses in Ireland.  This represents a staggering 4.6% of all housing stock.  Surely I am not the only person who sees this both as a problem and a major opportunity.<\/p> <p>Many, if not all, of those homes are situated in established residential areas where there are existing services, such as schools, shops, playgrounds and doctors.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis. <\/p> <p>The Government has continually stated that housing is one of its top priorities.  It has also stated that it is willing to listen to all suggestions.  This is an immediate answer to many of the housing issues and I just cannot understand why this Government is not looking at it more closely.<\/p> <p> This situation requires one thing and one thing only - funding.  What better way to use the national surplus fund than to invest it in bringing vacant homes back into the housing stock?  Many of these homes just need cosmetic upgrading that will not cost as much as building from scratch and can be brought on stream much quicker.  The longer we leave these houses vacant, the longer it will take to bring them back onto the market.  From my experience in Dundalk, I know that many vacant homes exist.  If you walk through any established residential area, I am sure you will find vacant homes, not only in Dundalk and Drogheda, but in many towns throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p> The housing crisis is not going away.  Once we emerge from this pandemic, the demand for housing will still be there.  The effects of the housing crisis are clear to be seen and it affects us in many ways.  First and foremost, we must not leave anybody homeless.  As a society, we must be able to provide housing for everyone.  Young families starting out on their journey are finding it nearly impossible to secure their first home.  When we look at this more closely, I fear that unless we solve the housing crisis we will eventually lose out in investment from many of the large companies already situated in Ireland.  They will look elsewhere when expanding, if it is the case that their workforce cannot secure suitable housing.  I know from dealing with constituents in Dundalk that many of the big employers in the area have concerns about the lack of suitable accommodation for their employees.<\/p> <p> On the motion, I once again voice my support for the suspension of the payment for 2021, but I also ask the Government to use the fund for housing.  As I have said many times in this House, Louth County Council has been to the forefront in bringing vacant houses back into the housing stock.  It has identified many vacant homes and upgraded them so they could be used as homes again.  From speaking to officials in the council, the only thing holding them back is funding, which I am sure is the case for every other county council in the country.  I am sure that with a little effort by the Government the vacant homes issue could be resolved, which in turn will go a long way to solving the overall housing crisis.  As I said, the Government has continually asked for solutions; this is a ready-made solution.  It is a no-brainer.  The Government needs to listen.  This is not about political point-scoring, but about real solutions to real problems.<\/p> <p> The rainy day fund should be used to bring vacant homes back into the housing stock.  Why build new homes in an area if homes already exist in it that are vacant?  This does not make any sense.  We need to think outside the box.  If we target even a third of vacant homes as ones to be brought back into the housing stock, it will mean in excess of 30,000 homes could be brought on stream over the next 12 months.  Surely, the Government can see this is a solution to a major problem.  I will repeat that there are 92,251 vacant addresses in Ireland.  That is one in every 20 houses situated in established areas, with schools, shops, playgrounds and doctors.  I ask the Minister of State please to listen.  I call on the Government to have an open and honest debate on the housing crisis and to discuss my proposal that the rainy day fund should be used to bring vacant homes back into the housing stock.<\/p> <p> Last week, I raised an issue with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions.  He told me he would contact the Minister of State's office which, in fairness, has contacted me.  It concerns a company in Dundalk, Air Bound Trampoline Park, which looks after people with disabilities and is doing a fantastic job.  The problem is it cannot get insurance.  The Minister of State's office gave me a contact name but when we contacted the company concerned it stated that all it would look after is outdoor activities.  The trampoline park is an indoor facility.  I again plead with the Minister of State, whose Department kept its word, as did the Taoiseach, to help us keep this trampoline park open.  This is only one of many such facilities and if we can help this one, I am sure we can help the rest.  I thank the Minister of State for his support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900027#AA00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636479000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>The rainy day fund, known as the national surplus exceptional contingencies reserve fund, is supposed to be an economic buffer.  There is currently no money in the country's rainy day fund because it was raided last year due to pandemic expenses.  Let us not forget, pensioners in this country did not receive one extra cent from this so-called rainy day fund.<\/p>  <p>  There are far more needs now than there will be years down the line, for example, the fishing crisis.  This Government gave away 25% of our pelagic quota on Christmas Eve last year.  That was a real happy Christmas to every fisherman, fisherwoman and child in our country's coastal communities.  They did not get a brown cent.  Where was the rainy day fund for the fishermen at that time?  They are since counting their severe losses.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers are in desperate need and will have a very bleak-looking future if the Government continues in the way it is going at the moment.  It kicked the can down the road on the issue of giving any funding to farmers in this year's budget.  That is fine if people can afford to have the can kicked down the road but the farming sector, which got no funding, certainly cannot.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand why we are talking about rainy day funds when urgent projects need funding in our country.  I have continually pleaded with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach, when they have been before the House over the past number of months, for funds for roads in west Cork.  They do not believe or understand that there is a need for that.  There is nothing for bypasses in Innishannon and Bandon, the northern-southern relief road, Bantry, the N71 and the R586.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was honest enough to state that it would possibly take eight to 13 years.  There needs to be investment in transport in rural Ireland.  There are now some talks about such investment, which is needed urgently.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of energy is rising rapidly leaving every person, including the most vulnerable, yet again, in debt.  Funding needs to be put aside and invested immediately in this as people are in fuel poverty.<\/p>  <p>  There are no special needs assistants, SNAs, in our country.  Last week, I asked the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohue, about that and he said that they would be available next year.  That is no good for people who need SNAs in schools this year.  There is no funding available for that.  People in schools all over west Cork are telling me they are short of SNAs, whereas the capital seems to have no problem getting them.  We also need funding for CoAction, which is closing its centre in west Cork this week because there is no pay parity.  That is another project that needs funding immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900028#BB00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1636479000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this issue.  While I do not blame the Minister of State, I certainly understand why we cannot put any money into the so-called rainy day fund when the Taoiseach went to COP26 in Scotland and gave away &euro;225 million this year, with a promise of more over the next ten years.  How could we have any money to put into the rainy day fund?<\/p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the Covid pandemic has been a savage strain on the coffers of the Department of Finance, this is not the thing to do.  We are not a country rolling in money such that we can give away &euro;225 million when it is raining for many already.  People cannot get proper healthcare or a proper service.  It is pouring down on top of working people, including those in the transport business.  The farming community did not get a bob in the budget and, on top of that, the cost of diesel is savage now.  It is raining down on top of farmers every day because they cannot move without diesel and it is an extra cost.<\/p>  <p>  People are struggling on waiting lists, many of whom are homeless, suffering and wondering where they will finish up.  Many people with families are being told to get out of the house they are renting.  It is raining for people because of high rents, especially in towns like Killarney, Kenmare and Dingle.  There are 676 applications on our local improvement schemes list, only 31 of which were completed over the past two years.  At the rate we are going, it will be 80 years before that list is exhausted.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that matter.  Surely, we will not give away money next year when things like that have to be dealt with.<\/p> <p> Can the Minister of State imagine that people on benefit payments will not get any fuel allowance?  People on illness benefit and even all those who paid stamps would not get those benefit payments otherwise.  Someone on a benefit payment such as illness benefit who is living with a pensioner with cancer will not get the fuel allowance.  Can the Minister of State imagine that?  The Taoiseach then went and gave away &euro;225 million last week.  It is absolutely ridiculous giving it away like that when it is raining on a lot of other people in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900028#BB00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636479600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with the terms of the motion regarding a rainy day fund.  However, and maybe this is just my disposition, I am not quite as optimistic for the Irish economy as the Minister of State is.  I welcome the image he has portrayed.  He has no alternative but to portray that image, at least in public, although perhaps it is a belief he shares in private as well.  It is not just that we are not replenishing a rainy day fund, which I do not have a problem with because if ever there was a rainy day, it would be during a pandemic, but the amount of debt we are incurring, and the amount of spending and how little we have to show for it, are what concern me.  Obviously, we are not putting money away now because we need to spend money.<\/p><p>The general message I am hearing from economists, even to ordinary people, is that now is not the time to save money but the time to spend it because it might not be worth nearly what it is worth now in a year or two or in ten years' time if they saved it.  That is because the only way we can deal with the kind of moneys being borrowed by almost every country, but especially this country, is inflation.  I asked the Minister for Finance, who, more importantly from the point of view of any influence on monetary policy, is also the chair of the eurozone group of finance ministers, if he had any issue with inflation.  I asked that because of the effect it is having on ordinary people, which I will come to in a moment.  He said he did not.  That is understandable because if we enter a period of quantitative tightening, one of the first things that will be impacted will be the ability to sell Government bonds.  The fact that they are very attractive to international financiers should not necessarily be taken as a compliment because what else are they going to spend their money on in the current climate?<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance made an interesting speech at the end of the debate on the Finance Bill and it is one I would like to take up with him in person.  He talked about the use of language and said we needed to be able to have a reasonable, rational debate.  That is something I would agree with but in the same week, the Minister for Health, who is the Minister of State's party colleague, albeit a relatively new-found one, sat exactly where he is now and sent out a tweet saying that everybody who opposed his view was reckless.  We do not live in a system of <i>eine Stimme<\/i>.  It is not our way.  It is not democracy and it never should be.  We cannot label people who question things.  We had a Minister for Finance who sat where the Minister of State is now and spoke about &quot;pinkos&quot;.  I notice, by the way, that the Minister of State is wearing a nice pink shirt and red tie.  He referred to the pinkos and liberals who were questioning the orthodoxy of the Ahern years and the economic approach of Bertie Ahern.  I am not here to vilify the man.  There were achievements during his reign, particularly the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>To question and debate is a good thing in any democracy.  I have questioned and will continue to question the value that we are getting for the money we are spending on Covid response.  Our expenditure increased by 20% last year.  The European average was about 10% and the expenditure of countries like France and Denmark only increased by about 6%, in comparison with their infection rates, if we want to use that as the metric.  I do not think we can measure a society by infection rates or start to look at fellow human beings as mere carriers of pathogens.  It is a very sad state of affairs if there is no &quot;I&quot; or &quot;You&quot; in society but mere carriers of pathogens.  We are not getting value for money.  Nor, by the way, are we getting value for the relatively paltry infrastructural investment we are making at the moment.  Over &euro;100 million has been spent on the national broadband scheme to date and only 2,700 premises have been connected.  We have no idea what the overrun on the national children's hospital will be.<\/p><p>We need to look at how this State spends money.  Interest rates, most assuredly, will not always be where they are now.  Money will not always be as available as it is now.  That is what the rainy day fund was about.  I do not have a problem with the fact that the Government is not putting money into it now but I do have a problem with running a Department of Finance on the basis that cheap money will always be available in abundance because that is simply not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900029#CC00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1636479600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I have listened with interest to the contributions of Deputies to the debate on this motion.  I will respond to some of the points and issues raised.  First, I acknowledge that every person who spoke was supportive of the motion not to make the contribution to the rainy day fund, in view of the costs involved with Covid-19 and because there are other priorities at this particular point in time.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, fiscal support of over &euro;41 billion, which is nearly one fifth of the national income as measured by GNI*, was made available in 2020 and 2021 in the form of direct public expenditure, tax expenditures and below-the-line supports such as loans and guarantees.  Given the continuing presence of the pandemic and the economic disruption it continues to cause, when we include the funds allocated for 2022 the total amount provided for stands at approximately &euro;48 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The total value of payments made to date under the Government's three main support schemes, namely, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, or its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is over &euro;17.5 billion.  Over &euro;8 billion has been paid to households through the PUP and over &euro;6.5 billion has been paid to employees through the EWSS and its precursor, the TWSS.  Approximately &euro;650 million has been paid to businesses through the CRSS.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is steadfast in its commitment to there being no cliff edge to the EWSS.  It has been an extremely successful policy instrument during these challenging times, one which has greatly assisted us in maintaining the link between employers and employees.  As announced on budget day, the EWSS will remain in place in a graduated form until 30 April 2022.  That is six months after the lifting of most public health restrictions and two months after the PUP ceases.  The revised arrangements for the EWSS strike a balance between helping those businesses that continue to need support while recalibrating the scheme in light of the wider economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  Public spending next year will amount to &euro;87.6 billion.  The Government has been steadfast in its commitment to keeping this amount below the ceiling laid out in the summer economic statement.  Our medium-term strategy sets out that over the next two budgets we will restore our public finances, phase out temporary Covid-related spending and repair our public finances.  This strategy strikes the appropriate balance between tapering supports and investing in the domestic economy.  In budget 2022, core expenditure will grow by 4.6% in line with the trend of growth in our economy and by 2022, we will only be borrowing for capital spending.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth recalling how dramatically the budget landscape has transformed over the last two years and, in particular, how we entered the crisis with a budgetary surplus of &euro;2 billion.  While in the 2021 summer economic statement my Department forecast a combined deficit of just &euro;34.5 billion for 2021 and 2022, by budget day this had been revised to &euro;21.5 billion for both years, a reduction of approximately 40%.<\/p> <p>Critically, this means our deficit this year in terms of the national income is falling significantly.  As such, it is clear that we are reducing our overall borrowing this year and next year.  Budget 2022 will bring our overall national debt to just under &euro;240 billion.  That means a debt of &euro;50,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.  This is not where we want to be when interest rates start to rise again.  That is why we need to repair our public finances and put them back on a sustainable footing.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies spoke about housing.  As everybody in this Chamber is well aware, a core, if not the core, challenge facing the country in the coming years is housing.  The Government is determined to build more homes and total housing expenditure has more than doubled since 2016.  As of 2021, it will be more than 40% above the peak level in 2008.  The Government's Housing for All strategy targets delivery of, on average, 33,000 new homes per annum up to 2030.  Housing construction has already rebounded rapidly this year and there have been almost 30,000 housing commencements in the 12 months to August of this year. <\/p> <p> As part of the Housing for All strategy, under the Finance Bill 2021, the Minister for Finance is introducing a zoned land tax to encourage the use of land for building homes.  The primary objective of the measure is to increase the supply of residential accommodation, rather than to raise revenue.  Ensuring that people have access to home ownership in this country is a priority for the Government.  Focusing directly on those trying to access the housing market, the help to buy scheme has been a significant support for first-time buyers of new homes.  From 2022 onwards, the scheme is being continued at its current rates.  Following the recent tax strategy group recommendation, the Minister has also announced a full review of the scheme will be carried out in the course of next year.<\/p> <p> Also, on housing, as part of budget 2022, the Minister proposes to extend the relief for pre-letting expenses for landlords for a further three years.  This will continue to encourage landlords into the residential rental sector to return empty properties to the market as quickly as possible.  Deputies mentioned the importance of bringing vacant houses back into use.  That is important not only in the private sector but especially in the public sector through our local authorities.<\/p> <p> Given the likely continuing impact of Covid-19 on the public finances, it was clear from early 2021 that the making of the planned &euro;500 million annual contribution to the rainy day fund was unlikely.  Consequently, this was signalled in April 2021 in the stability programme update and the summer economic statement.  The Act which established the rainy day fund requires the Minister for Finance to bring forward such a motion when he decides not to pay the &euro;500 million to the rainy day fund from the Exchequer in any of the years from 2019 to 2023.  As I said, we commend this motion to the House.  <\/p> <p> A number of issues were mentioned regarding the commitment to build back up the fund.  I make clear in my opening contribution that the Minister for Finance wants to be in a position to add to the funds in the rainy day fund at some point into the future in order to be in a position to deal with any potential future economic crisis but to do so at this point in time does not make economic sense.  I was also asked about the future of the rainy day fund.  The Minister has made it clear that we are committed to adding to it as soon as resources permit.  <\/p> <p>I was asked about the lessons to be learned from the rainy day fund.  The first lesson was not only learned but implemented.  There was &euro;1.5 billion in the fund at the end of 2019.  That was used during the Covid crisis.  Had we not that money in the fund at that time we would have had to borrow another &euro;1.5 billion, which would have placed an extra burden on future taxpayers.  I mentioned the national debt can be equated to a debt of &euro;50,000 on the head of every man, woman and child in the country.  Having that money in the fund has alleviated to some extent an increase in our debt.<\/p> <p> Farming was mentioned by Deputies in the Cork region.  I confirm an announcement made earlier today of &euro;70 million to food producers and processors in the meat and dairy sector to help them deliver, diversify and win new markets and customers post Brexit.  One of the Deputies from Cork said the Government is doing nothing for farmers.  However, &euro;28 million of that of &euro;70 million was allocated to meat and beef and dairy processing facilities in County Cork.  That is a commitment to Irish agriculture and to suppliers and farmers and suppliers, who will have modern processing facilities for their products, and will help win new customers abroad. <\/p> <p> On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900029#CC00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636480200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Regional Transport Infrastructure: Motion [Private Members]","time":1636480200,"counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900030#DD00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1636480200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

<i><\/i> <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with colleagues and I will take five minutes.  <\/p><p>This Private Members' motion is an attempt to put balanced regional development and investment in public transport at the centre of Government and to be central to tackling the climate change crisis.  The national development plan was to be the litmus test of the Government's commitment to regional development.  I believe that is a test that it has failed.  Right now, workers and families are being hit hard by carbon taxes.  This is not only unfair but also an environmental strategy that will not work.  Taxes designed to change behaviour only work when the people have alternatives.  This motion is crystal clear.  We need State-led investment in strategic infrastructure for our regions.  We have decades of evidence of how successive Governments have failed to deliver for rural Ireland, not least the west is categorised by the EU as a region in transition.  This is not a case of just a political party saying that Governments have not delivered for the west.  This is being said by the EU also and by many other commentators.  We desperately need State-led investment in infrastructure but, sadly, we seem to have another Government that is unwilling to lead.  We have 94,000 km of regional and local roads across the State that provide vital connectivity for, and to, rural Ireland.  Yet despite years of empty promises, in Mayo we still do not have delivery on the likes of the N26 and R312.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward this motion to give the Government a second chance, a chance for it to show voters it is serious about regional transport infrastructure, it is serious about reducing carbon emissions and that it has a vision for our country beyond maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>and blocking change.  This motion is a direct response to the Government failure to deliver on very modest demands for investment in infrastructure in the regions.  The motion calls on the Government to provide clarity on all projects included in the national development plan, ensuring balanced regional development is prioritised in the delivery of projects; to introduce a requirement for the Government to undertake rural impact assessment of all policies; and to prepare a new all-island national aviation policy that recognises the impact the pandemic has had on our regional airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock; to resource Bus &Eacute;ireann via the National Transport Authority and to ensure there is no curtailment on the intercity Expressway services; as well as to urgently deliver key public transport projects such as those outlined in the Cork metropolitan area strategy and the Galway transport strategy.<\/p><p>Regarding an issue that is very close to my heart as is the case for many people in Mayo and across the west, the motion calls specifically on the Government to fully commit to the delivery of the western rail corridor extension to Mayo.  The western rail corridor has become a byword for regional development and investment in the west.  Why has the Irish Rail 2040 rail freight strategy not even been released yet?  That strategy has remained unpublished for almost a year and it is referenced in a number of recent publications, including the terms of reference for the rail review and the draft consultation for the greater Dublin area transport strategy published today.  The west will not forgive another Government for failing to deliver on this project.<\/p> <p> If the Government does not support this motion and commit to the western rail corridor, what little faith people in Mayo and across the west have left in it will continue to erode and disappear.  The publication of the economic report by the former Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, economist, Dr. John Bradley, earlier this year confirmed what Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying for years, namely, that there is a strong business case for restoring the rail connection between Galway and Mayo via Tuam and the western rail corridor should be reopened and prioritised as a capital project.  Many Government Deputies from the west have been very critical of the national development plan, NDP, and the complete lack of any commitment to the western rail corridor.  They are right.  Not including the project in the NDP is a missed opportunity for the Government to show it is committed to regional development in the west.  I call on Members from the parties in government to take this second chance to support regional infrastructure development and the reopening of the western rail corridor by voting in favour of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900030#DD00400","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636480800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  It is incredible that on the day the national development plan was launched, we were told by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that there were projects included in it that will never be delivered.  That made sense, however, to any of us who read it, given that it provided for &euro;5.1 billion for new roads, &euro;800 million of which was already committed to roads at construction, but there was a long list of 30-odd projects at a cost of approximately &euro;1 billion each.  We could see straight away that the numbers did not add up.  Despite this, two days later, to appease disgruntled backbenchers, we were told by the Taoiseach that there were things not included in the plan that would be delivered.  That said it all.  It is exactly what one gets when there is a coalition pulling in different directions and for different reasons.  It was clear the Government could not agree what needed to come out of the plan, so nothing came out of the plan.  It was a charade and an embarrassment and it would be a joke if it were not so serious.<\/p>  <p>  There is any number of reasons that the NDP is hugely important.  It should be a statement of the commitment of the State to lead in delivering balanced regional development and strategic development.  There is an important point that has not been picked up on in the debate, namely, that there seems to be a dangerous shift in decision-making processes.  Instead of trying to create an overarching plan in a logical way, there is a shift to a kind of survival-of-the-fittest strategy.  We are told projects will proceed on the basis of which of them get through planning and reach the starting line, or the famous decision-making gates, first.  It will be very difficult in this scenario to provide a counterbalance to the already dominant regions.<\/p>  <p>  I could say more about rail and roads provision but there is not time.

The 20-X20 bus route has not been reinstated, even though thousands of people in rural towns and villages relied on it.  Earlier this year, the 51 bus route was cut back severely, leaving passengers with no evening service after 5 p.m.  Fortunately, after intense criticism, that decision was rolled back, but only slightly.  Rather than fully reinstating the service, with one bus leaving every hour until 8 p.m., there is now only a 7.05 p.m. service.  Even before these cuts were made, rural Ireland needed more public transport links, not fewer.  The NDP also failed to commit to a western rail corridor, something that is desperately needed to build connectivity between communities in the west.  It seems we all share a vision of an Ireland with less reliance on personal motor vehicles but that vision will not be realised without policy and funding.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise another piece of infrastructure that is central to the success of coastal areas like my constituency, namely, piers.  For communities that are built around the sea, including many parts of Connemara and, in particular, our offshore islands, a safe and functional pier is vital.

This is not something that just happened; it was the direct consequence of our region being at the bottom of the table when it comes to Government investment in health, roads and third level education.  It is a direct result of the failure of successive Governments to invest in critical infrastructure and ensure the region west of the Shannon got its fair share.  Unfortunately, by the looks of the national development plan, the Government has failed to grasp the serious situation in which our region finds itself.<\/p>  <p>  We have an opportunity to address this by way of the European Regional Development Fund.  For every &euro;100 the Government spends in our region, the EU will provide &euro;60 of that contribution under this funding.  It is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.  Taking public transport as just one example, we have a situation, as referred to by my colleague, where the 20-X20 Dublin-Galway route, an important route covering a number of rural towns from Ballinasloe to Ahascragh, has been lost.  There is also an issue with the Local Link bus service, which covers a really important route from Ballaghaderreen to Roscommon, stopping in rural towns and villages that have no access whatsoever to public transport.  When I contacted the National Transport Authority, NTA, seeking an increase in the service, I was told that the authority is there to work with Local Link to increase the network but the money is not there to do it.  Ordinary people are being crippled with diesel and petrol prices the likes of which most have not seen before.  At the same time, the very few alternatives that are there, such as Local Link and the 20-X20 route, are being pulled or the money is not there to fund them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to make a decision.  Is it going to fund the alternatives and make it easier for people to access them, or is it going to keep cutting vital public transport networks and refusing to fund the existing ones to make them better?

If one is going to where I am from, Gweedore, or somewhere on the Inishowen Peninsula, the journey will take four and a half or possibly up to five hours.  Is it any wonder that our towns and villages in rural Ireland are suffering and failing to retain talent and attract investment?  The infrastructure to support the north west and other parts of rural Ireland is simply not there.  Donegal is one of only three counties in this State that do not have access to rail services.  The last time a train travelled through Donegal, my mother was a teenager.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the indication by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that a rail network to the north west, as he termed it, is doable.  It is long overdue.  However, any railway to the north west must directly connect the region to Donegal via stops along the way, whether in counties Tyrone, Monaghan or Meath.  That is the vision and ambition the north west needs.  Investment in rural transport and infrastructure must also include investment in bus services.  Last week, I raised the issues with the Bus &Eacute;ireann route that connects Donegal town to Dublin.<\/p> <p>It was cancelled 183 times in the past two years.  One could not make that up - 183 times cancelled.  That is happening without warning and often without proper notice via Bus &Eacute;ireann.  People are standing on the side on the road in the dead of night with no idea whether the bus will show.  Constituents have contacted me and have told me how they have missed flights and appointments.  This Government is launching another flashy brochure about major investment in new rural bus services and people are literally standing at the side of the road wondering if the bus will turn up.

Rural communities have been dismissed by Government for far too long.  The days of the development plans being used for D&aacute;il re-election must end now.  During my time in the D&aacute;il, I have constantly made representations about the shortcomings of our public transport links, but what actions have been taken?  Has the timetable between Limerick Junction and Waterford been adjusted?  No, it has not.  Has the same been done for the Ballybrophy line?  No.  Has the X12 service been restored for Roscrea and Nenagh?  No, it has not.  Does the Minister for Transport have any intention of stopping rolling work closures on the Ballybrophy line, in favour of getting the job done in one go?  No, he does not.  Indeed, he did not even give me his views on the matter when I asked in a parliamentary question.  When announcing the connecting Ireland rural transport plan recently, we were told the new standard for rural bus services is at least three return trips per day.  Why does this standard not apply to the north and south Tipperary rural rail lines?<\/p>  <p>  People in rural Ireland continue to face the same old struggles to do business and travel to work or education or even hospitals and yet as much attention was given in the national development plan to plans to extract water from the Shannon as was given to any projects for my county.  That says much about this Government.  Deputies such as I may stand here and outline what our constituents and rural businesses need, but this Government persistently ignores our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  We see the Government clapping itself on the back for its plans to reduce emissions by freeing up town centres.  Try convincing the people of Tipperary town of its concerns.  There was no mention of the need for a bypass of Tipperary town in the national development plan, despite it constantly being raised in this House.  We just saw the N24 project being relegated to subject to approval status.  This is hardly a ringing endorsement of the project.  We need clarity on this and on all the projects alluded to in the national development plan.<\/p>  <p>  These are just some of the reasons we needed to bring forward this motion.  Rural Ireland needs a balanced approach to development that helps our towns, villages and rural communities and listens to them.

Due to the failure of past and current Governments, that is simply not the case.  The western rail corridor is one of the key infrastructure projects which needs to be delivered for the west of Ireland to ensure it can be competitive and bring industry, commerce and productivity back into that region and yet the Government continues to turn its face against it.  The transport infrastructure policy of this Government needs to have a clear focus on delivering the western rail corridor.  That needs to happen as an absolute priority.  Buses and where our bus network throughout the country has huge problems continues to have issues.<\/p>  <p>  Fortunately, County Leitrim has been part of a recent pilot project with the Local Link where we have improvement in the number of buses on the roads, connecting all our small towns and villages into Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo and other areas and more people are using them.  It proves the point that if infrastructure is put in place, people will use that and ensure it is delivered.  Government continues, and this has been a policy for many years, to put pilot projects in place, prove they work and then pull them and put them nowhere else.  We have seen that happen time and again.  We want to make sure that does not happen in this context and the work that has been done on the Local Link project is spread throughout the entire country and expanded upon, because, that is what needs to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to raise the issue of school bus transport, which has been an almost continuous yearly issue in that children are left standing along the side of the road who cannot get a bus to school.  Absolutely key for people living in rural areas is making sure they have transport to send their children to school in every part of the country, not just in some select areas, which seems to be the policy of this Government up until now.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I will raise is aviation and specifically Ireland West Airport.  The local authorities throughout the west have come together to put money aside to try to help develop Knock airport because it is key strategic infrastructure that needs to be developed to develop the west and ensure the potential of the people in the west is there for future generations.  Unfortunately, the Government continues to put all its emphasis on a few small areas, mainly in the capital city.  We see today the Government is pulling what money it was going to deliver, even for the capital city.  A huge problem we have continuously highlighted is of people in rural Ireland needing to get fair play and it must be ensured that they are delivered some sense of that.  Key to all of this is having adequate infrastructure in place.

I have no doubt there will be much agreement among all of us on the importance of regional and rural transport infrastructure.  Too often, when we talk about transport, we end up discussing the cities.  However, I am keenly aware rural and regional Ireland need improvements to its transport infrastructure and I am happy to have the opportunity to update the House on what this Government will deliver in that regard.<\/p><p>Government is not opposing this motion.  However, there are a number of issues and inaccuracies within it, which will be highlighted in the ministerial speeches.  I must take issue with the statement that successive Governments are failing rural Ireland.  In that past few years, we have seen the creation of a specific Department dedicated to rural and community development, while in 2018 the Government published the national planning framework of which two of its ten national strategic outcomes are dedicated to regional and rural Ireland, while the national planning framework is fundamentally centred upon ensuring a more balanced approach to development.  Just this year, the three coalition leaders launched Our Rural Future which, at its heart, has an ambitious vision for a thriving rural Ireland which is integral to our national economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being and development.<\/p><p>This Government recognises the importance of investment in our transport infrastructure for rural Ireland, how it is essential for the social and economic growth of our villages, towns and cities and the key role it can play to ensure balanced regional development and increased connectivity throughout the State.  Included among Our Rural Future's 162 actions are those related to improving active travel, bus, rail and road infrastructure and I can assure the House the national development plan provides the funding to ensure delivery of these actions in the coming years.<\/p><p>This Government is allocating unprecedented levels of funding toward improving active travel and greenway infrastructure throughout the country.  For the first time, local authorities outside of the five cities can now apply for funding to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to support active travel improvements in towns and villages throughout the country, which is hugely positive.  In our greenway programme, we are eager to see greenways better link in with local areas to ensure they become more than just tourism amenities and can connect local communities with each other and with local services.<\/p><p>Deputies will be aware that the national development plan commits towards Connecting Ireland, a massively ambitious plan for rural bus services throughout the country.  This new plan seeks to improve the existing bus networks, add new bus services and enhance the current demand responsive transport network.  Improved and more comfortable transport options will support passenger journeys to and from rural communities, creating opportunities for balanced economic growth and stronger regional development.  The NTA is currently consulting on the draft proposals and I encourage all Deputies to take a look at those proposals for their areas and make suggestions as to how they might be improved.<\/p><p>I note the motion seemingly calls on NTA funding to be provided to expressway services.<\/p> <p>Deputies will be aware that there are two types of public transport: publicly subvented public transport and commercially operated public transport.  Taxpayer funding is provided to publicly subvented services through the public service obligation, PSO, programme.  It is not provided to commercial services because they are commercial.  It is a basic premise and also a feature of EU law.<br\/><br\/>During the pandemic, Expressway, like other commercial operators, was able to avail of temporary Government financial support.  However, the impact of the pandemic has been profound on certain Expressway routes from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast.  Following the decision to cease operating these Expressway services, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of various corridors to determine whether it was necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public.  The NTA concluded that other than the X8 from Dublin to Cork route, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and that the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for further intervention.<br\/><br\/>In relation to rail, the national development plan, NDP, commits to increased investment in the inter-urban and inter-regional rail network.  This increased investment will permit track relaying on the Dublin to Cork line to increase line speeds.  It has been facilitating track renewal works on the Ballybrophy line.  It will also allow for improvements on the Limerick Junction to Waterford line.  Importantly, a strategic rail review has commenced.  It will examine all aspects of inter-urban and inter-regional rail on the island of Ireland.  It will examine how to improve regional rail connectivity.  The review will provide an investment framework for the development of the railway sector over the coming decades.  As well as enhancing regional accessibility and supporting balanced regional development, it will consider the potential for high-speed rail links between the major cities.  It will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing or future potential corridors of the network, including the western rail corridor.  It will provide the objective, evidence-informed basis we need to make investment decisions about the rail network.  I expect a public that consultation phase on the review will commence in the next few weeks.<br\/><br\/>I note the motion also refers to two of our regional cities, Cork and Galway.  I am glad to report that there are significant projects under way in both cities.  I am even more pleased to report that this Government will deliver significant projects in all four regional cities.  In Cork and Galway, public consultation is well under way on the BusConnects projects in each city, with the NDP committing to substantial completion of those projects by 2030.  In rail, phase one of the Cork commuter rail programme was included in Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan.  It is scheduled for completion by 2026, with both Ceannt Station and Oranmore station having committed funding in the next few years for upgrades required at both stations.<br\/><br\/>Early next year should see the completion of a feasibility study on possible future upgrades for the Athenry to Galway corridor.  This Government and I recognise that we need to invest in our national, regional and rural road network.  The NDP commits to maintaining the quality of the existing national road network, with approximately &euro;2.5 billion earmarked for the protection and renewal of our existing assets across the State.  Some &euro;5.1 billion is also being allocated to new national roads out to 2030, which will enable better regional accessibility across the country, as well as compact growth.  At a regional and local level, funding will allow the Department to continue to provide significant grant support for a range of protection and renewal programmes.  Regional and local roads are a vital lifeline for rural communities and also act as public transport links for local link services as they exist today and will be expanded in the future.<br\/><br\/>Taking to the skies for a moment, I would like to highlight the new Regional Airports Programme 2021 to 2025, which was published this year.  The new programme proposes a continuation of the subsidised air services between Dublin and the regional airport at Donegal.  As part of the new programme, &euro;10 million in capital and &euro;3.9 million in operational support has been made available to the regional airports during 2021.  A further &euro;6 million was made available under state aid-approved schemes to help airports mitigate the effects of Covid-19.  Overall in 2021, three regional airports, Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock, and Kerry, will have been allocated almost &euro;20 million in Exchequer supports.  The two regional State airports in Cork and Shannon will have received &euro;51 million in 2021.  This level of funding of our State airports is simply unprecedented. <br\/><br\/>Finally, on aviation, I note that the motion calls on the Government to prepare a new all-island national aviation policy.  However, I would note that since its departure from the EU, the UK is no longer required to implement the EU <i>acquis<\/i>in respect of civil aviation.  Given that civil aviation is under the remit of Westminster, as it is a reserved matter, it operates under a different regulatory framework to civil aviation in Ireland.  Air transport operations between the two jurisdictions are governed by the provision of EU&ndash;UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  Therefore, it is neither appropriate nor feasible for the next iteration of the national aviation policy to be approached from an all-island perspective.  Obviously, the issue of improved cross-Border connectivity will continue to be considered under the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC.  I am happy to inform the House in that regard that the Irish Government has agreed to take forward a review of potential options for supporting viable air services on two routes, Belfast to Cork and Derry to Dublin, as part of discussions on air connectivity.  As I said at the outset, the spirit of this motion is broadly in line with the principles of this Government.  However, it does not reflect the great work currently undertaken, nor our vision for the future of regional and rural transport services.  It is about making sure that people have options.<br\/><br\/>Transport connectivity is hugely important for people who live and work in rural and regional Ireland.  It is key to bringing life back into our towns and villages.  To have strong local economies, and to give people real options for getting around, one needs good transport links, including good public transport options.  Expanding the public transport network and increasing service levels in the ways set out in our policies and currently being delivered by our projects will lead to a balanced regional development and greater connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900032#FF00400","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636482000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Unfortunately, huge areas of Cork that will miss out on any public transport or proper public transport.  Rural areas that have come into the city boundary are particularly affected.  The Government talks about the importance of reducing the effects of climate change, of saving the environment, and about preventing global warming.  Yet, the things that make the most sense, that will not destroy people&rsquo;s lives, are just not being done.  Areas such as Carrignavar, Whitechurch, and many other areas on the periphery of the city, will only have buses every two hours.  How does this provide public transport for people?<\/p>  <p>  Over the summer, we were canvassing, knocking on doors, and meeting people again.  We were going to houses where there were four cars.  The husband and the wife both had a car, as did the son who might be going to college and the daughter who might be going to work.  There were four cars at each house.  If we are talking about proper transport systems and about proper public transport, how we are going to get people out of their cars?  For many people living in these towns and villages, what has come out of COP26 means nothing to them.  BusConnects, which they need, means nothing to them because it is not being provided.  That is down to the Government&rsquo;s failure, to the failure of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, and of the Green Party, to deliver proper public transport.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside this, there is the scandalous price of public transport, in particular the train from Dublin to Cork.  I checked the price this afternoon.  The cost of bringing a family of two adults and two children up from Cork to Dublin by train is almost &euro;200.  The Government is trying to get people out of their cars.  People have to go to Dublin for events, holidays or what have you.  How can you justify that kind of expenditure, compared with using a car?  If you use a car, you can stop off and get food and fuel and it would be at least half the price of the train.  The Government needs to care about providing public transport that is affordable to people.  You cannot travel by bus from many parts of Cork to the city and many people cannot afford to use the train.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900033#GG00300","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1636482000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The motion is about recognising the importance of regional transport and for it to be financially backed.  For years, I have been calling for the construction of the Mountmellick N80 bypass.  This is important regional infrastructure.  It has been promised for decades with little progress.<\/p> <p>The feasibility study was completed last year.  The Government needs to be ambitious about regional transport and it needs to be backed up with money.  Mountmellick bypass is based on a busy route, the N80, connecting the midlands and the west to the port of Rosslare, which is even more significant now due to Brexit, since hauliers are using this route to get goods to Rosslare and directly to the Continent, understandably bypassing the British landbridge.  The current situation is unacceptable and ignores the serious traffic issues on the ground in Mountmellick.  Trucks are driven through the centre of the town.  There is a T-junction in the middle of Mountmellick.  Lorries have to cross over to the wrong side of the road, at the very far side, to get around this.  This presents dangers.  Despite all of this, the project is not included in the national development plan.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Transport some time ago and was informed that the project is not even listed on the national roads programme 2018-2027.  There is no mention of it in the national development plan.  I ask the Minister to look at the N80 again.  It is carrying a substantial amount of traffic, including from the Minister's county, to the west.  Traffic coming from Mayo, Roscommon and other counties and going to Rosslare is travelling through the centre of Mountmellick.  I ask the Minister to revisit that.<\/p> <p> I also raise the need for bus shelters.  I have been raising this with the National Transport Authority for years.  If we are going to get people to use buses, we have to provide bus shelters.  Borris-in-Ossory, Mountrath and Castletown on the R445 need bus shelters.  Ballylynan, Newtown and Crettyard on the N77 need bus shelters.  If we expect people to use the bus, that is what we have to do.  People catching the bus in those localities are getting soaked on a wet day, or on a wet morning going to work, to a hospital appointment or to  anything else.  Bus shelters are fundamental infrastructure.  I ask the Minister to take this up with the NTA.  Why is it so difficult to put these in place?  In the neighbouring jurisdiction, just up the road, there are bus shelters all over the place, even for school transport.  We need to give that role to local authorities and let the local authorities provide them.  They will fix it and provide shelters.  The NTA is not the right body.  If you have to write to somebody in Dublin about a bus shelter at Crettyard, the game is lost.  That needs to be done at local council level.  I appeal to the Minister to devolve that power in his time in office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900033#GG00400","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636482600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>With the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, which was announced today, the people of Meath and the surrounding counties will be disappointed by the Government again but they will not be surprised.  It has been revealed that building works on the Navan rail line that we have been demanding for decades will not commence until 2031 at the earliest.  Given the shambolic record of this Government in delivering projects, it will most likely be a decade or more after that.  We are in the middle of a climate emergency where building the Navan rail line could do more for the environment than any other project, taking thousands of cars off the road.  Meath is the fifth largest county in the State, with 210,000 people, and it is growing.  Navan is the largest town in Ireland not serviced by rail.  Some 81% of people leaving Meath to work do so by car.  I spoke to a lady the other day who asked me about the Navan rail line and when it might be built.  She told me that every day she goes to work, leaving Meath for Dublin.  She pays &euro;6 every day on tolls, &euro;15 a day on parking in Dublin, and &euro;100 on fuel for the week.  That is more than &euro;200 a week just to get to work and then home.  It is getting to the stage where people are not able to afford to get to work.<\/p>  <p>  We are spending &euro;2 billion a year on congestion.  For many years, the people of Meath have been left behind by successive governments, spending up to ten extra hours a week out of their lives away from family, due to overly packed buses and traffic congestion.  This is entirely unacceptable.  The people of Meath and beyond will not accept a start date of 2031 for the Navan rail line.  We have waited for long enough already.

Unfortunately, what we have seen today in the NTA's draft transport strategy from 2022 until 2042 is a failure to bring forward ambition.  There is certainly no ambition when it comes to Wicklow.  Unfortunately, we have a Government that makes little mention of Wicklow, especially west Wicklow, which has little or no public transport.  The Government is blocking the upgrade of the N81, which is critical infrastructure.  If the Government is serious about reducing the daily number of car journeys by 500, one would think that it would put public transport in place.  There is no mention of west Wicklow in the NTA strategy, such as extending the Luas from Tallaght to Blessington.  There is no provision for increased bus services.  On the other side of the county, there is little by way of plans for the Dublin to Rosslare rail line that could be rolled out immediately.<\/p>  <p>  There is a reference to the possibility of extending the DART to Wicklow town.  It has been talked about over the last number of years and it is badly needed but according to this plan, it may happen within the next 20 years.  It is a failure of ambition.  There has been talk over the last decade about extending the Luas as far as Bray.  That was contained in previous plans, with the possibility of getting that brought forward before 2030.  In this plan, it could be 2042 before that takes place.  Unfortunately, the two main roads in the county, the M11-N11 and the N81, are both congested daily.  People sit in their cars, trying to commute to work, because of the failure to provide jobs within the county.  We need to go back to the drawing board in respect of the climate action plan and the draft NTA plan because they fail the people of Wicklow.  They fail dismally to put in place the infrastructure and public transport that are needed now.  We have 19th century infrastructure for the railway in the county.

It provides a timely opportunity for a debate about the need for better public transport and general transport infrastructure.  We will support the motion.  I am glad the Government is not opposing it.  It is timely, especially with the announcement today relating to the greater Dublin area.  The motion refers to transport infrastructure outside Dublin.  We might take a moment to ponder just how disappointing today's announcement by the NTA is and what knock-on impact it will have for transport infrastructure outside Dublin 2, the counties in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, and for all of us living and working in Dublin city.  In my constituency, Dublin Bay South, we clearly need to see what it will mean for us all.  It will clearly have a seriously detrimental impact on the Government's ambitious targets for climate emission reductions.  That is a real concern.  I have been calling on Government to provide greater clarity about the implementation of measures to reduce emissions.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the ambitious climate targets that we have set ourselves.  We must all recognise the need to meet those targets.  We must also be conscious of the need to have clarity about how those targets are to be delivered.  Marie Donnelly, the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, was clear last week about the need to put in place, over this year and the next few years, the necessary infrastructure to enable us to deliver the more ambitious reductions in climate over the latter half of this decade, between 2025 and 2030.  Yet, today, the NTA made an announcement kicking forward any delivery of major projects, such as MetroLink, light rail and overground infrastructure.  This announcement is deeply disappointing.  It is an appalling delay.  It illustrates why we need a clear timeline and plan to meet targets when we see such delays.<\/p>  <p>  One of the positives that we have seen over the last 20 months was an increase in people using active transport such as walking and cycling.  I welcome the NTA's commitment to improving infrastructure there.  We need to be clear that cycling infrastructure in Dublin is still severely lacking.  It still feels unsafe to cycle on many streets in the city centre.  I speak as someone who cycles every day.  The segregated cycle lanes across many parts of the city are welcome but, all too often, they are not joined up.<\/p> <p>A cycle lane finishing with oncoming traffic on O'Connell Bridge is one example of that.  We need to ensure much better cycle infrastructure and give people the choice of using public transport.  Today's announcement for the greater Dublin area is disappointing.<\/p> <p> There are issues with our transport infrastructure across the country, particularly in the north west.  Our policy is to ensure better investment in public transport, not just in Dublin, but in towns and villages across Ireland.  We have put forward the idea of a rural transport guarantee to ensure every rural town has guaranteed access to reliable, affordable and sustainable public transport and every child has a guaranteed place on a school bus.  Our transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, has put forward the need for that joined-up thinking across the country with regard to rural and urban public transport.<\/p> <p> Some of our public representatives in counties affected by the lack of investment have asked me to put three questions to the Minister of State, which she might address in the round-up at the end.  First, Councillor Conor Sheehan in Limerick asked whether the Minister of State will supply a timeline for commuter rail stations around Limerick that were announced in the national development plan.  I would be grateful for a response, even in writing at a later date.  Second, will the Minister of State provide a timeline for the rail spur to Shannon Airport?  That question is also from Councillor Conor Sheehan.  Third, Nessa Cosgrove in Sligo asked me to find out when we can expect to see real movement on the western rail corridor.  That was clearly an issue of great concern to all those in Sligo and other counties in the west.  <\/p> <p> As the Labour Party spokesperson on disability, I raise the question of accessible transport.  Not only must our transport infrastructure be sustainable and climate-friendly, we must also ensure it is accessible.  I have been sent videos of people struggling with wheelchairs on buses and in train stations as part of the Make Way Day campaign and more generally from colleagues in Labour Disability and others.  Footpaths and shopping amenities can often be an impediment to access.  People with disabilities need guarantees of being able to access public spaces.  Local authorities should conduct an audit of accessibility in towns and villages across the country, looking at simple remedies such as dishing of paths to ensure no kerbs, matching up of paths with opposite sides of the road and pedestrian crossings.  They may sound like basic and mundane measures but they can be the bedrock for those with disabilities or those pushing buggies, on which safe and secure transport networks are based.  These are the sorts of measures that will encourage more people to walk to work or to shops rather than take private cars.  We have legislation providing for access officers in all public bodies but we need dedicated disability officers in local authorities to work with planners and ensure we can rectify past mistakes in building infrastructure that is not accessible enough.  I have put in parliamentary questions on how public bodies can comply with their obligations under the Disability Act, particularly in ensuring towns and villages are safe for those with disabilities.<\/p> <p> There is a need to stop further cuts.  The motion contains a reference to cuts that have been made to Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway routes from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast and states that these cuts have impacted connectivity and frustrated efforts to reduce transport emissions.  I endorse the points made in the motion because if we want to reduce our emissions and meet our targets, we must ensure cuts made to routes are reversed.<\/p> <p> We saw in the Climate Change Performance Index today that our low performance has slipped further.  We are now 46th in the rankings on how we have addressed the climate crisis.  We remain among the low performers in greenhouse gas emission categories and we know we are performing poorly on international ratings generally on meeting climate targets, despite having set welcome ambitious targets.  These cutbacks to crucial routes in cities outside Dublin must be addressed to ensure we meet the targets and provide connectivity for people in different settings.<\/p> <p> Part of the motion deals with regional airports.  Since March 2020, we have consistently called on the Minister for Transport and the T&aacute;naiste to ensure the sectors most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, namely, aviation, tourism and entertainment, continue to receive adequate supports throughout the public health emergency.  We are conscious, as all colleagues are, of the unique challenges that have been presented to the aviation sector, in particular.  I call on the Minister of State to ensure supports, where necessary, are maintained, particularly for smaller regional airports.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party supports the motion and urges the Minister of State to look at the announcement made today in relation to the greater Dublin area and ensure that where we have, on the one hand, ambitious targets on emission reductions in transport, we do not with the other hand make cuts to public transport routes, delaying the development of vital public transport infrastructure and not delivering the sort of transport facilities we badly need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900034#HH00400","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636483200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Catherine Murphy, who is sharing with Deputy Holly Cairns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900035#JJ00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1636483200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>This is a timely debate, particularly given the announcement of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area that was published today.  It is important that other parts of the country pay attention to what is occurring with this strategy because one would expect the same approach to follow in other areas.  Between 1996 and 2016, the population growth in this region was as follows: Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire both grew by 13%; south Dublin by 28%; Fingal by a whopping 41%, making it the fastest growing area in the country; Meath by 40%; and Kildare by 39%.  Fingal, Meath and Kildare absorbed most of the population growth and housing development.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at patterns of growth elsewhere, the suburbs of Cork have grown.  The part of the county that has come into the city has grown most.  In Galway, development is occurring in the suburbs and putting significant pressure on the city centre, without transport alternatives, rail being the most efficient of those.  We see housing developments arriving in what is called a development-led approach.  There is pressure on facilities and services, such as schools and community facilities, but transport is the most prevalent one.  As I pointed out last week on a similar issue, when you listen to AA Roadwatch in the morning, the N4 and the N7 are mentioned repeatedly every day.  We know what that is like because it is the area we are trying to navigate through.<\/p>  <p>  The expectation is that when high levels of population growth are seen, other services will follow, but that is not usually what occurs.  Many transport projects were announced but not built.  The railway interconnector was first suggested in the 1970s.  It was part of the Dublin transportation initiative in the 1990s.  Six governments later, we hear today it has been postponed to 2042.  That is five governments away, assuming a government lasts five years.  It is depressing.  MetroLink is again delayed and no commitments to dates of delivery can be provided.  Transport is the second-biggest emitter of CO2 and we have binding targets that will get much more difficult as we proceed through this decade and into the next.  There appears to be a reliance on electric vehicles to reach the targets in urban and rural areas where there is not a great chance to provide large-scale public transport, albeit it should be provided in a different way.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, DART+ is going to Kilcock, but you cannot get on it.  I pointed that out last week.  There is no station but there are eight railway sheds.  That does not make sense.  The same will be the case with the Kildare line.  It is only going as far as Celbridge, but there is a big catchment of about 50,000, including Naas and the towns around it.  People feel they have no option but to get in the car and that is what the Government wants to discourage.<\/p>  <p>  Cities like Galway are choked with traffic.  Cork cannot be the counterpoint to Dublin unless it is properly planned and there is provision of services.  The same is the case in relation to suburban transport in Limerick.<\/p> <p>It is not that there is an unwillingness by urban communities to use public transport, but they must be given the opportunity to do that through ambitious projects that can be delivered within a reasonable timeline.<\/p> <p> In recent weeks, two carbon budgets were announced and commitments were made at COP26.  If we miss our targets on transport and retrofitting, it will put increasing pressure on the agriculture sector because these areas are all interconnected.  Today, the T&aacute;naiste said the Dublin transport strategy was not approved by the Government, but most of the projects were included in the national development plan and we are seeing some of them postponed.  Unless we have timelines, it is very difficult to see how we are going to meet our targets on transport.  This is a very serious issue, given how transport relates to the other aspects of our climate targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900035#JJ00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636483800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Transport infrastructure is an essential prerequisite for regional development.  I will focus on a few key points in the time available.  First, public transport in rural areas is essential for accessibility and social inclusion and can make a substantial difference in achieving climate goals.  The lack of a robust and reliable public transport system continues to be a challenge and an obstacle for people living in rural areas in accessing employment, education and health services.<\/p>  <p>  Public transport is an equality issue.  It is a vital service that helps those who cannot drive or cannot afford a private vehicle to get jobs, reach medical appointments and take part in cultural events.  People with disabilities in west Cork highlight the inadequacy of the Local Link services, despite recent improvements, and how some services are not wheelchair accessible.  People must rely on family or taxis to get around or even to attend day services or training in some cases.  The lack of transport remains a significant barrier.  It is also an age and gender issue, as young and older people are the demographic groups which disproportionately use public transport.  Many of the older cohort do not have driving licences, especially women aged over 70 who, for historical reasons, never learned or were not permitted to learn how to drive.  They deserve a public transport system that allows them to live full and healthy lives.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the absence of proper bus stops and shelters is a major issue.  Towns and villages across west Cork and rural Ireland are screaming out for sheltered bus stops that would at least allow people to sit and wait out of the rain.  That is a bare minimum.  Given that we are in Ireland, we know it is going to rain.  It is unbelievable that in most towns and cities there is not even somewhere to sit and stay dry.  That is a major disincentive to the use of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  Despite a decrease in transport emissions last year due to Covid restrictions, this sector is a massive contributor to our overall emissions.  Public transport can play a clear role in alleviating this.  As we face a period of significant change to meet our emissions targets, public transport can and must be central to these plans.  We need more public transport.  We also need more frequent services, guaranteed accessibility and late-night routes.  Such services must be subsidised.  Funding is the key to this.  Despite the Minister of State's assurances on the amounts spent, unless funding translates into regular, dependable and accessible transportation for as many people as possible, it is not working.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there will still be a requirement for safe and well-maintained roads.  They are a crucial social and economic link.  Economic strategies can only be successful if the necessary infrastructure is in place, from broadband to roads.  Roads are essential for emergency services and connecting rural communities with hospitals and even GP surgeries which are increasingly contracting.  Public transport obviously has limitations in rural areas compared with built-up areas, and roads are fundamental to filling in the gaps.  Crucially, better and safer roads also encourage cycling and other active travel.  We need rural transport to be joined up to allow all people, young and old, to switch from different forms of mobility quickly and cheaply.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the issue of road safety recently.  There are numerous accident black spots in west Cork, such as the New Court corner west of Skibbereen and the Baxter's Bridge junction near Bandon, which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, knows.  They are unbelievably dangerous.  How many accidents does it take for something to change?  I seek an assurance that once a place is known to be dangerous, automatic interventions are implemented to save lives.<\/p>  <p>  Third, in terms of maritime transport, there is a need to support the ferry services that sustain island communities.  They are vital links that must not be overlooked in discussions of rural and regional transport.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for clarity on all projects in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, including funding and timescales for the progression and estimated completion of projects.  Deputy Catherine Murphy highlighted a concern of mine around the Government's rural development policy.  A plan without clear targets, timescales and costs is not a plan but a wish list.  The success of rural Ireland lies in a properly funded transport system.  We need better public transport, integrated approaches and safer roads.  Ultimately, we need the public investment to make this possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, referred to rural Ireland but it is difficult for many to understand how far-reaching the impact of the lack of public transport is in rural areas.  I will give one example.  In the past, people could always go to the community welfare officer if they needed to present as homeless and look for emergency accommodation.  Due to the upsurge in homelessness on account of the housing crisis, they now have to go to the local authority housing office.  There is no public transport from many towns in west Cork to the housing authority.  The issue was brought to my attention in the case of people fleeing domestic violence who do not necessarily have transport.  They might have children and lots of stuff and they cannot get to the housing office.  That is an absolute disgrace and it highlights the specific need for transport in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900036#KK00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1636483800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for introducing the motion, which gives us an opportunity to discuss infrastructure.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, is aware of my passion for the western rail corridor and I will take a few minutes to speak about that initially.  There is a lot of confusion about what we are trying to do but, in a nutshell, we have rail connectivity from north Mayo as far as Claremorris, and then it takes off eastwards towards Dublin.  We have rail connectivity from Galway to Athenry and the service goes down along the south coast and complements the western rail corridor, phase 1, which was opened in 2011.  This is the fastest growing rail line for commuter passengers in Ireland currently, with more than 500,000 passengers last year.  Phases 2 and 3, which would link Athenry to Tuam and on to Claremorris, are left as a void.  This connectivity would bring together Galway and Mayo.  It would also bring together Galway, Mayo, Clare, Limerick, Cork and Waterford in terms of rail freight.  It is a very simple project, which is shovel-ready, in other words, it does not need planning permission or consent from anybody.  It is a replacement of the railway track from Athenry to Claremorris.  What would that do for the economy, balanced regional development and every one of us who lives in this area, including both the Ministers of State who are present?<\/p>  <p>  By providing such connectivity, we are opening up the potential for rail freight as part of our carbon emissions targets.  At the moment, we run rail freight from Ballina, right through the congested lines at night, to bring it down to Waterford and Dublin Airport.  We are trying to develop a port in Foynes, to make it a flagship for offshore wind development, but we must also develop Galway Port and establish connectivity with it.  We also need connectivity with Cork and Waterford and to open up the western rail corridor.  The corridor has been supported by the Atlantic economic corridor task force, Chambers Ireland and the local authorities in Galway and Mayo.  I dare say it is probably supported by every political party in this House.  The only thing that is holding it up is the absence of the willingness to do it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is passionate about doing the western rail corridor.  He is doing an all-island review at the moment to try to bring together a full strategy for rail.  I accept what he is doing, but I believe there is an opportunity for the Government to put its stamp on regional Ireland and take out of the equation the mantra that we are not doing anything for the west, the north west or the mid-west.  We have a situation where we can positively discriminate in our investment in the region.  According to the European Union, we are a region in transition and we can tap into a 60% share from Structural Funds to make projects like this happen.<\/p> <p>We should use this as an opportunity to develop the area.<\/p> <p> One of the most unique things is that there is some resistance to it but I think that resistance comes from within a Department which has control of transport.  I do not know why, but it just does not seem to get that what we are trying to do is develop Ireland.  I live, work and have my constituency office in Tuam and that is where I went to school.  Tuam is the largest town in County Galway.  If we build out this network, we will be reconnecting Tuam to the national rail network.  The western rail corridor is unique in the sense that it is probably the only piece of infrastructure that does not link into Dublin, so it has great potential.  We need to make sure that we can link Westport, Ballina and Claremorris to Galway and Tuam, then down to Ennis and along to Limerick and Cork.  We have to look at the potential for tourism development in all of this.  We have to look at the idea that we can bring tourists into Shannon and Knock airports and get them around the region, using the brand of the Wild Atlantic Way and using the western rail corridor as a mode of transport for them.<\/p> <p> It is very important that we take this on board in a positive way and that we are brave about it.  Some people will say that rail is a thing of the past.  In what we are doing in terms of climate action and changing our whole approach to living in order to save the world, one of the key potentials we have is rail transport.  What I mean is that we take the trucks off the road and put the containers onto rail freight.  Companies are demanding that so they are running their businesses in a way that meets their green carbon targets.  That is the potential that is there but, for one reason or another, successive Governments have never supported the idea of rail freight in Ireland.  It has only happened through the efforts of a certain few people who have produced much of the rail freight from Ballina down to Waterford, against the grain and against a lot of resistance from within Departments.  We do not subsidise it.  About &euro;2.5 million is contributed from the Exchequer to Irish Rail annually but a levy is then put on top which ensures it does not make any money.  It is hilarious what is going on there.<\/p> <p> It is also important that we think about this.  When we talk about tourism, there are companies in Ireland doing rail tourism and they rely on lines like the western rail corridor to make sure we further realise the potential on the west coast, from Cork up to Donegal.  It is important that we take that on board.  In phases 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor, we have a gem of a tourism attraction, which is Ballyglunin station, the location of the film \"The Quiet Man\" that was made many years ago.  Even today, businesses like Ashford Castle are bussing tourists over to that station as an attraction.  It has a powerful attraction.  Would it not be great if we could run trains from Galway out there with tourists on a day trip?  It is a place where the local community are refurbishing the station, turning it into a museum and also into a broadband connection point and digital hub, which is bringing innovation and history together in a museum.<\/p> <p> We have the potential right on our doorsteps to do this.  From the point of view of the west of Ireland, it is important that we create this linkage and get rid of the stigma that we are not supporting the west.  We can put funding into the area but when we talk in the national development plan about a cancer treatment facility in Galway for the west of Ireland which services Donegal down as far as Limerick, we need to have the public transport for people to access that.  What better way to do it than by train?  People can travel and work on the train, and there are many benefits to doing this, for example, it is the safest mode of transport.  The only thing that is missing is the fact we just do not seem able to get it to a stage where we can start the work.<\/p> <p> This is something the Government and political representatives in the west have to consider seriously.  We have to work together to make sure we do this.  This will create the linkage and create the spine for the activity that is needed if we are to survive and grow out of being just a region in transition.  As I said, it has the support of the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, the Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly and the Southern Regional Assembly.  It also has the support of local authorities and all of the business communities.  The only thing that is missing is the Department of Transport, which needs to come out of the dark ages and to see how, under phase 1, this is the fastest-growing line in Ireland in terms of rail transport.  Phases 2 and 3 will only add to that, and we will only see the full benefit when we link it all together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900036#KK00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636484400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Collins, who is sharing time with Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900037#LL00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1636484400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Rural communities are the most at risk of energy and transport poverty.  That is according to a new study from a variety of universities which claim that rural residents in Ireland are most at risk due to a lack of access to national heating infrastructure, a high risk of power cuts and the fact they live in older homes with poor insulation.  Transport poverty issues are linked to the lack of nearby goods, services and jobs, as well as poorer services when it comes to public transport.  Rural villages across Ireland have no access to viable public transport, even under the Connecting Ireland plan the Government published for public consultation a few weeks ago.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, plan only proposes an overall increase of 25% in rural bus services, and a 25% increase on nothing amounts to little, let us face it.  A frequent, reliable and direct public transport system is key to reducing rural isolation and reducing dependency on cars.  However, the Government simply does not get the importance of public transport outside the M50.<\/p>  <p>  I am blue in the face from saying the same thing over and over in the D&aacute;il.  The Government wants us to reduce our carbon footprint but without proper and adequate transport.  There is not a hope in hell this can be done.  We were further ahead in the 1960s, when we had a train network that extended all over west Cork, right down to my own parish of Schull and down into Bantry and places like that, than we are in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, in saying that, I welcome the plan that was published last week.  There is obviously room for change and, when having a meeting with the NTA, it was generally accepted that we would have a bit of feedback into the plan.  I see that services will run five times a day on the Baltimore to Union Hall route and three times a day on the Dunmanway to Kinsale route, which will take in Clonakilty, Courtmacsherry, Kilbrittan and Ballinspittle.  Services will also run three times a day from Dursey to Kilcrohane, Castletownbere, Glengarriff, Bantry and that area and there is also Mizen Head to Castletownshend, which includes Goleen, Schull and Ballydehob.  I have concerns and I will be working with the NTA going forward in regard to areas like Drinagh and Ballinacarriga.  The route from Goleen and Durrus to Bantry is not being serviced, and there is also Lisheen, Ardfield, Inchydoney, Timoleague, Ballyroe and Newcestown, and out to Ardgroom, Eyeries and Allihies.  These are areas that need to be looked at.  They cannot be exempted and let go.  The very focused, frequent service that people get in Dublin is what we should be getting in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Cork Local Link has been excellent in rolling out services in the last number of years.  It should be connected with West Cork Connect, which is another service that is coming out of Skibbereen and Bantry several times a day to Cork.  We also need to look at late-night services.  We cannot just say we are going to provide a service in the morning.  Young people want to use public transport and the Government is advising us to use public transport.  It is another area that needs to be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at school transport.  We put proposals to the Government in our budget submission that we would cut down on the original 3 km limit for children going to school, which is very important.<\/p> <p>I am assuming that all these new NTA plans will include the PSO routes so that young people will get the 50% deduction on all this travel going forward.  It is an interesting time and I hope the Government can deliver immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900037#LL00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636485000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this very important subject because we do not have public transport in many places in rural Kerry.  A few years ago the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that one car in a village would service six or eight different families.  Is that the ideal that he is still going by or that the Government is still going by?  I welcome the eight new routes that should be allocated to Kerry, including from places like Fenit to Farranfore Airport three times per day.<\/p>  <p>  However, much of the carbon tax that is being collected, after the &euro;225 million that was given away the other day, is for new bus after new bus for Dublin city.  Double decker buses and other long buses in Dublin have big signs on their left-hand corners warning people to look out for the tail swing.  Buses are so big and plentiful that there is hardly room for anything else on the roads.  If you watch outside the D&aacute;il gate the buses are going by one after another and there are only two or three people at most inside any of them.  Places like Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin and Cordal are far away.  The Government is saying that 500,000 people will be walking by 2030 but can you imagine walking from places like that to work or cycling from Gneeveguilla or Scartaglin, Lauragh, The Black Valley or Bonane?  That is not on.  I know it might not be by choice and that the Government is tied on to the Green Party but that is the decision that was made and that is the worry I have.<\/p>  <p>  On school transport, no child should be left behind if he or she is more than 1 km from a school.  I mention our road network and the local improvement scheme, LIS.  We still have 676 schemes on the list.  The people in Kerry are entitled to a good road to their doors the same as the people in Dublin 4.  These are public roads; not private ones.  They are public roads that were never taken in charge.  We need a bypass for Killarney because it has over 18,000 vehicle movements every day.  That is too much, the people of Killarney are being choked up and it could affect our tourism product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900038#MM00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1636485000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing this very important Private Members' motion.  We are starting on the back foot when we have a Minister for Transport who says he does not like building roads.  There is a massive increase in the cost of motoring and fuel is going close to &euro;2 per litre, which is a frightening prospect because everything is reliant on roads in our country.  I recently had a meeting with a number of car dealers in Kerry.  A wise man attended that meeting and he is not young but I will not say he is old either; he is an experienced car salesman.  He asked me if I would stand up inside in the D&aacute;il and tell the Government that people cannot afford the electric cars they are being told to buy.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing in the world as efficient as a properly serviced and maintained diesel engine.  That is a fact and I will argue that with any environmentalist.  Any environmentalist who thinks he or she has a monopoly on protecting the environment does not.  We are as concerned as anybody else about protecting the environment but we have the common sense to know that if you own a well-performing diesel engine it is rubbish and nonsense to think about getting rid of it to buy an electric car.  We are after closing down a number of our ESB generating stations so our electricity is becoming scarcer and at the same time we are telling people to use more of it.  If you own a diesel car the message should be to hold onto it, maintain it, change the oil in it and keep it running for as long as you can.  You are doing better for the environment by doing that then by buying something for which the production of its battery is an enormous blow to the environment.  That is a debate for another day.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Macroom and Baile Bhuirne bypass and the future Listowel bypass.  We definitely need a bypass for the Killarney bypass.  Even though we have a Minister for Transport who does not like building roads, we will have to try to build those roads in spite of him and without him.  We will do so because we are entitled to them.  The same as the people in Dublin are entitled to a lot of things; we are entitled to these things in County Kerry as well.  I thank the private taxi and bus operators who provide a service in County Kerry and in rural Kerry, whether it is Tralee, Killarney, Killorglin, Cahersiveen, Listowel, Kenmare or Sneem, we have excellent people there providing those services.  They are not public services; I am talking about private operators and I thank them for the business they conduct.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a worrying time.  Last week a lot of people would have turned in their graves.  It is not for me to comment on what other political parties do but the leader of the country and of what we would call a one-time major political party came out and made a statement.  He was accused of making a speech that could have been attributed to the Green Party and he said he took that as a good compliment.  When the Taoiseach of the day comes out with a statement like that we are in worrying and disturbing times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900038#MM00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1636485000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I want to make a few points about public transport in Cork.  The transport news that has dominated today has been the news of the delays in key public transport initiatives in Dublin.  It is in sharp contrast with what the Government said last week at COP26 and at the launch of the climate action plan that there are delays in key public transport initiatives.  A key public transport initiative in Cork is the plan for light rail.  We need to know when we will have light rail and we will not be tolerating delays to it.  Delays in Dublin are also unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects is in the news in Cork and a new round of public consultation on it has opened.  The proposal is to increase services in the city by 36%.  That is not sufficient and it needs to go further.  There are big population increases on the cards in Cork over the next number of years and a 36% increase does not match up to that.  We need to be more ambitious.  BusConnects needs to ensure that the travelling time for people in key suburbs is not increased by connecting with other areas.  For example, the trip from Ballyvolane to the city centre by bus takes about 15 minutes.  If that service from Ballyvolane was to run to the city centre via Blackpool that would increase to something closer to 30 minutes.  I understand that is the type of measure that is being looked at.  We need to improve the service for the people in the likes of Blackpool but we should not do so at the cost of disimproving the service for the people in Ballyvolane.  If BusConnects is to be a success, it would be important to take that point on board.<\/p>  <p>Under BusConnects, 200 extra buses in Cork city is being spoken of.  An investment of &euro;200 million is being spoken of.  The central bus garage at Capwell is not a suitable location for an expansion of that size.  Capwell is already too small for the needs in the city.  It is bounded by houses on both sides.  It is bounded by schools as well.  It has been accepted for some time now that Capwell will not be sufficient.  There was an attempt to secure a depot at Monaghan Road last year.  The attempt to do that was not successful.  There has been an attempt to secure a depot at North Esk.  My understanding of the position is that at best Bus &Eacute;ireann would be able to secure the North Esk site for a maximum of five years for a variety of reasons.  I am not 100% certain of them and will not speculate here on the floor of the D&aacute;il but I understand that five years is the maximum that could be got there.  Therefore, North Esk is not a long-term solution.  It may not even be a medium-term solution.<\/p> <p> I understand that there is another reason an alternative location for a bus depot is needed in Cork city.  Above and beyond the expansion of the fleet, there is the question of the electrification of the fleet.  My understanding is that if you electrify your bus fleet, you need more storage space, not less.  You need to have room for chargers, you need to have more space between your buses and you may need to dig up what is underneath the ground surface in your depot.  My understanding is that what is underneath the ground surface in the depot in Capwell would make doing that a difficult and expensive job, which may even raise a question mark as to whether you can have Capwell as a depot for your buses alongside another location or whether you will need to move from Capwell, lock, stock and barrel, and have another location entirely.  The question of securing a new bus garage, depot and storage space in Cork city is a priority issue of some urgency now that will need to be watched carefully.<\/p> <p> On BusConnects and the expansion of public transport, in the budget it was announced that there was to be half-price travel for a cohort of young people, I think, aged 18 to 23, to be introduced.  That is a step forward but it is a half-measure.  The climate emergency does not call out for half-measures.  It calls out for emergency measures.  The emergency measure that is necessary here, I believe, is free public transport for all.  That is an idea the time of which has come.  It is something about which we need a government to say, \"Yes, we are going to do that.\"  There needs to be pressure put from below on Government by the emerging climate movement to have free public transport in this country.<\/p> <p> On the question of a Cork-Limerick motorway, the idea of treating the climate crisis as an emergency in the State is not compatible with building a motorway between Cork and Limerick and a motorway should not be built between Cork and Limerick.  That is not to say that there is not investment needed on the road there.  There are a number of towns that need to be bypassed and increased safety provisions need to be made on that road.  However, if we are looking at improved connectivity between Limerick and Cork, and we should do that, what we need to look at is improving rail services between the two cities and improving bus services between the two cities, including stop-offs that will facilitate people in getting from A to B in work situations, and improving public transport as you come into both Limerick and Cork so that when you arrive, you are able to travel efficiently and cheaply around the city that you are arriving in.<\/p> <p> Those are the key points that I want to make.  I reiterate the point about the bus garage and the bus depot in Cork.  That is an issue, given the expansion of services with BusConnects and issues of electrification, that needs to be addressed now as a matter of some priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900038#MM00400","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636485600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Deputy Harkin is sharing time with Deputy Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900039#NN00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1636485600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>First, I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this important motion on regional transport infrastructure, which, if delivered, would be an important component in helping to deliver balanced regional development.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth examining where we are right now and the latest figures in regard to roads and road spend.  The most recent figures that I have are from the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.  Between 2008 and 2018, the average national road spend per kilometre in the north and west region was &euro;87,000, in the southern region was &euro;103,000, and in the eastern and midland region was &euro;199,000.  Some people might say there are more national roads in the eastern part of the country than, for example, in the rural north west, and that is true, but the figures quoted here are per kilometre.  In effect, the amount spent per kilometre in the north and west area is less than half of what is spent per kilometre in the eastern half.  That is a shocking difference and clearly shows the huge imbalance in national roads spend per kilometre between the regions.  If we look at regional and local roads, there is a gap.  It is much less, but there is still a gap.  There is a lesser spend per kilometre on regional and local roads in the northern and western region than in the eastern and midlands region.  In fact, according to the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, the spend per kilometre is 9% less.  There are a lot of figures there but they clearly illustrate the imbalance in spending and it is very significant.<\/p>  <p>  We have all been assured that the national development plan will reverse this trend and, finally, deliver balanced regional development.  However, as this motion states, \"senior members of Government, up to and including the Taoiseach, have indicated publicly that a number of critical regional infrastructure projects outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030 may never be delivered, casting doubt on approximately 30 road projects, while other public transport projects will be delayed\".  It will, therefore, be extremely difficult to see if the national development plan, NDP, is, in fact, delivering the regional balance.  That is why I strongly support the call that there must be clarity, or at least more clarity, around funding and timescales for all projects in the NDP.  Without some level of clarity, we will be living on the never-never, as it were, and my huge concern is that this approach may further widen the gap between the regions.<\/p>  <p>  A really important part of this motion is that there will be a rural impact assessment undertaken by all Departments and public bodies in relation to their programmes.  We are told that we will have value for money impact assessments and climate impact assessments, and that is perfectly correct, but we also need regional impact assessments if we are genuine about delivering balanced regional development.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, was present.  I wanted to raise with her the issue of Sligo Airport.  I think this is my sixth time to raise it in the House.<\/p> <p>Sligo Airport has no passenger services but operates the busiest search and rescue operation in the State.  It has not received a single cent of public money in more than ten years.  It needed about &euro;370,000 to fund essential works.  That was whittled down to &euro;280,000 and finally to &euro;200,000 but there is still no money on the table.  The latest we are told is that it is on the Minister's desk awaiting ministerial approval.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to pass this query on to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for a written reply as the delay, at this point, is simply inexcusable.  <\/p> <p> I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for giving us a chance to debate the crucial issue of regional transport infrastructure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900039#NN00300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636486200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I also wish to start by thanking Sinn F&eacute;in for the motion.  I will zone in on two aspects that have already been mentioned, namely, the rural-proofing of all policies and budgets, which we have sought for years and the delivery of the western rail corridor extension to Mayo as a key infrastructure project for regional development.<\/p>  <p>  There are two reports in this regard, namely, one by EY entitled, The Western Rail Corridor: Financial and Economic Appraisal, followed by a very detailed report by Dr. John Bradley, The Atlantic Railway Corridor &ndash; The Galway-Mayo Rail Link: An Appraisal.  Both are worth reading.  The first was commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann followed by a peer review and that was followed by Dr. Bradley's detailed report that sets out the differences and the issues between the two reports.  What is not at issue the need for the western rail corridor, as set out in a number of policies that have already been clearly set out by Deputy Canney.  I will mention one point quoting the regional spatial and economic strategy, which observed that &ldquo;The Western Rail Corridor is of strategic importance as it represents a piece of key enabling and sustainable transport infrastructure for the region\".  I am looking at a report where it finds that the business case does not justify it and it fails to tie it in with policies.  I do not see it quoted anywhere in the report that it is of a strategic nature and it is essential.  There are a number of interesting things about Dr. Bradley's report.  He dedicates it to \"Dr. Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il, SJ, ar &oacute;c&aacute;id a n&oacute;chad&uacute; breithl&aacute;\" - we all know who Dr. Mac Gr&eacute;il is - on his 90th birthday, and who, Dr. Bradley says, fought so long and so hard for the development of the west.  The Minister of State came in here tonight and her speech took issue with our statement of the fact that we have ignored rural Ireland.  She said that is not true.  I am afraid it is true.  We see it in that dedication to that priest and sociologist, and onward with the groups on the ground who have all fought to have sustainable development in the west of Ireland.  We have utterly failed to do that.  We have many good policies which I could not argue with.  It is the implementation of them that has a lot to be desired.  Another interesting thing about Dr. Bradley's report is his mention of Alexander Nimmo and his works in Ireland.  We all know who Alexander Nimmo is and we are certainly very familiar with him in Galway in both the city and the county.  Nimmo's Pier is a stone's throw from where I live.  When there was no money in Ireland, and he was given instructions to have minor works, he ignored the instructions and went for a massive public infrastructure programme, which has stood the test of time.  Nimmo's Pier is still there in Galway among many other piers, houses and so on.  That was at a time when we had nothing.  <\/p>  <p>  If we have struggled to put the west on the map it is all the more important now with climate change and the biodiversity emergency.  The Government will hear this over and over again because we have to make words mean something and we have to allow sustainable development in the west of Ireland to take the pressures off the cities.  I am all for one who wants to develop Galway city, but in a sustainable way.  When she was here, the Minister of State utterly failed to say that we have no park-and-ride in Galway even though it is in the development plan since 2005, we have no feasibility study on light rail.  I heard Deputy Barry talk about Cork.  We have 24,000 signatures from many years ago begging the Government to carry out a feasibility study.  In the context of tonight's motion, I would point the Minister of State towards Dr. Bradley's research.  He sets out the differences between the two reports and the cost analysis.  He said there was a very strong business case for re-opening the railway from Galway to Mayo.  He set out the differences between the two reports.  I am running out of time to go into them but capital costs was one of the main arguments.  His report takes that apart.  There is also time saving.  Dr. Bradley also said the EY report is full of errors, and not only typographical errors.  He was not even negative about it, he just highlighted it.  He said he was giving a fresh appraisal of this project because it is absolutely essential in the context of climate change and of Brexit, that we would have balanced regional development.  It makes absolute sense to have a railway running from Galway up to Mayo and beyond if we are seriously interested in our commitments under law, in relation to climate, and in relation to balanced regional development.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900040#OO00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1636486200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I am deputising for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is unavailable tonight.  It is clear that Deputies on all sides of the House are committed to improving transport infrastructure in regional and rural Ireland.   I think it is clear we are all committed to improving transport infrastructure in rural and regional Ireland.  Nobody has a monopoly on this issue.  It is clear this Government is committed to improving transport infrastructure across the country.  That commitment is evidenced in the national planning framework and the Our Rural Future policy but is also backed up by the funding allocated under the national development plan for the next ten years and the funding allocated under budget 2022 to allow Connecting Ireland launch next year.  To pick up on a point made by an earlier speaker, sometimes projects do get delayed.  That is part of the planning process.  Were the Department of Transport, a Minister or local authority to interfere in that, I am sure that some of the Deputies who spoke would take issue with the same Government for a different reason.  All Deputies will remember the tribunals that took place for different reasons.  Planning processes are independent and for a good reason.   We all agree that an improved transport system has an important role to play in promoting balanced regional development and enhancing rural connectivity but also crucially addressing climate change.  There is no dispute from any side of the House, let alone the Government side, that these improvements need to be delivered.  However, there are aspects of the motion that seem to wish away best practice in terms of project delivery.  It is clearly the case that costings and schedules for projects are subject to uncertainty in the earlier stages of development.  The earlier the stage of planning, the more uncertain the cost of the project and the timelines around delivering it.  The purpose of the public spending code&rsquo;s decision gate approach toward Government approvals is to gradually develop that certainty, in order that when the Government is asked for decision gate 3 approval, the cost and schedule estimations are then as certain as they can be and are the baselines against which to measure success.  It is simply the case that within the national development plan you have a variety of different projects at different stages of their project life cycle, so for some the cost and schedule estimation process is well developed and for others it is much less well-developed.<\/p>  <p>  I also share the motion&rsquo;s wish for improved investment in our national rail network.  That is why the Department and the Minister welcome the increased funding provided by the NDP to do just that.  I know there are passionate views expressed by Members from all parties, and none, about various proposals to further improve our rail network.   The Minister and I recognise the long-standing advocacy of groups such as West-On-Track in terms of their campaigning for the reopening of the western rail corridor, which Deputy Canney and others mentioned.  As noted in the motion, earlier this year West-On-Track published a report it had commissioned on the proposed reopening.  I do not think it would surprise anyone to know that a report commissioned by an advocacy group advocated reopening the line.  What the Government has approved is not to consider issues like the western rail corridor in isolation but instead to look at our inter-regional rail network in its entirety, not just to consider it on the basis of the State&rsquo;s network but to look instead in the context of the entire island of Ireland.  That is why we have launched a strategic rail review and I encourage everyone to take part in its public consultation, which should launch very shortly.<\/p> <p>The Minister and i welcome the motion&rsquo;s acknowledgement that the impact of all Government measures on rural communities needs to be assessed closely.  I have no doubt but that the proposers will welcome the fact this is already a requirement.  All memorandums for Government decisions must provide an assessment of the impact on rural communities.  Furthermore, the national planning framework places the concept of balanced regional development at the very heart of everything the Government must do across all its policies and strategies.<\/p> <p> I endorse the comments of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, on Connecting Ireland.  The initiative could potentially be transformative for public transport in rural Ireland.  It will expand bus services across the country, linking local communities with the destinations they need to access, be it for work, education or leisure.  This is something previous speakers referenced, especially in the context of Covid.  Obviously, in rural Ireland the car will always play an integral part in people's transport needs.  As we strive to meet our climate action targets, those cars will increasingly become zero-emission vehicles.  While I welcome the continued funding committed in the NDP towards the protection and renewal of our regional road network, if I could be parochial for a moment and consider my own County Limerick, the Government has committed to funding the improved active travel, bus and rail infrastructure that will benefit both the urban and rural areas of the county for generations.  The Limerick greenway, Limerick BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and improved rail infrastructure services will be funded under the NDP and I look forward to seeing that being delivered.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I reiterate my view that the House broadly agrees on the need for investments in rural and regional transport services and state as fact that the Government has demonstrated a commitment for ongoing investment across these services.  I thank the Acting Chairman and Deputies for giving me the time to respond to the House on that.  I am sharing the remainder of my time with Deputy Calleary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900040#OO00300","speaker":"1494","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636486800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Conway Walsh and O'Rourke for giving us the chance to discuss this matter this evening.  Deputy Connolly quoted an tAthair Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il, to whom the Bradley report is dedicated.  I will come back to the report in the context of the Minister of State's remarks.  I want to speak about another priest, Monsignor James Horan, who, 40 years ago, showed how it is done.  In the face of the same kind of opposition and the same kind of sticking its head in the sand from the Department of Transport as we have today, especially the permanent side of it, he developed Knock Airport.  He had a phrase which is often quoted by our colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  He referred to the policy of the Department as \"MAD\", meaning maximum administrative delay.  Keep putting it on the long finger and hopefully it will go away.  Tonight there is an all-party motion saying we are not going away.  We are not going away on the western rail corridor.  We are not going away on road projects such as the N26 or on proper regional development.  We do not want sticking plasters but ambitious stuff that makes a difference.  That is what is laid out in the Bradley report.  I tell the Minister of State it does not matter who commissioned it.  Its findings will stand up to any independent analysis.  In that it is unlike the EY report commissioned by the Department at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;500,000, which has many flaws within it.<\/p>  <p>  The context of waiting for an all-Ireland rail review for a project that has been reviewed so often is typical of the maximum administrative delay strategy.  This works.  It works not just in the context of the western rail corridor and the extension of the existing corridor to County Mayo and beyond, hopefully, but in the context of the all-island Atlantic economic corridor.  If we are serious about regional development we will build a ballast to the east right from County Derry to County Kerry.  It would be all-island and all-coastal, with a spine going down through it that has rail at its centre.  This would be rail that is sustainable.  It would be rail not just for freight but for passengers too.  This will allow people to move off-road into a proper commuter rail service linking the west.  It will link the cities of Galway and Sligo to communities for hospital services, education and day-to-day living.<\/p>  <p>  That is the kind of sustainability we should seek in the climate action plan yet it seems the west coast is to be the location for offshore wind and onshore wind.  Whatever kind of wind farm you are going for will be located in the west.  We will be expected to provide the energy but we are at the end of the queue when it comes to the benefits.  These are kind of the benefits I am referring to.  The western rail corridor will allow, through the Atlantic economic corridor, the infrastructure of wind farms to be moved by rail not road.  As I have said, it will encourage people to go off-road and use public transport for their day-to-day work.  It fits all the headings this Government is about and last week's climate action plan is about, yet we keep delaying it.  We keep saying we will have another review.  We cannot have any more reviews.  I am calling for the preliminary work to begin.  It is not a choice between the rail corridor and a greenway.  Both can exist perfectly well alongside each other.  It seems again we are being offered greenways all over the west but tell that to the second biggest producer of Coca-Cola concentrate in the world.  Tell that to one of the biggest healthcare manufacturing sectors in the world, which we have in County Mayo.  Ask them do they want to export their stuff on a greenway or do they want to do it on a proper road or on a proper railway.  Real regional development is about putting that infrastructure in place with ambition and respect and without any further delays.<\/p>  <p>  I join Deputy Connolly in paying tribute to an tAthair Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il; a priest, a sociologist and somebody with no commercial interest in rail but who has led this campaign.  I pay tribute to West-On-Track, including Colm&aacute;n &Oacute; Raghallaigh and people like him who are leading it in spite of so many hits.  They are in the spirit of Monsignor Horan.  Ireland West Airport Knock has developed into a facility that employed 170 or so people before Covid with over 800,000 passengers.  The economic benefit of it still has not been fully reached.  Why do we have to keep fighting?  Why do we have to keep constantly harassing?  These are things we are entitled to.  The only change I would make to this motion is that I think we need an all-party committee on the implementation of the NDP.  It covers so many different projects and Departments.  It suits those who do not want to see progress to have it siloed in committee after committee.  One overall Oireachtas committee on the implementation of this plan would see it delivered once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900041#PP00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1636486800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>We return to Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Funchion to close the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900041#PP00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1636486800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for bringing this important motion forward.  The constituency I represent, Carlow-Kilkenny, is a good mix of urban and rural.  While it is a fantastic place to live and work we are certainly lacking public transport.  It is an integral part of a functioning rural community and has an important role in reducing emissions, which we are all apparently in favour of, though when it comes to actual practice it is hard to know whether we are.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the recent budget ,the young adult travel card was announced.  It was welcome and I though it a positive move.  However, for rural communities where we do not have very much public transport it excludes private bus operators.  I am obviously an advocate for public transport but in some of our communities where we do not have that, to not roll it out to those operators is a missed opportunity.  We would really would benefit from that.  Students from counties Carlow and Kilkenny would especially benefit from that as we have had a recent announcement about the institutes of technology in Carlow and Waterford amalgamating to form a technological university for the south east.  It would be hugely beneficial for students if they could avail of this but for the most part there are only private providers in the constituency at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  It is ironic that our Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently at the COP flying the flag for Ireland and all we are going to do to encourage people out of their cars and onto public transport yet it is certainly lacking in this constituency.  I add that as somebody who travels to Kilkenny on the three days we are up here, if I were to rely on public transport I would have to leave here at 6 p.m. to get the 6.30 p.m. train, as it is the last train to Kilkenny.  It is incredible to think that is the situation in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I briefly mention the situation in Carlow with the bus service.  There has finally been an announcement it is going to go out to tender but it is not going to launch until next autumn.  Imagine a town like Carlow still has no bus service and we only recently got a proper bus service in Kilkenny city.  I am going to run out of time very shortly so I again commend my colleague and urge everybody to support the motion.  On rural communities, the Minister of State is in one himself and it really is important we have good public transport and that there are options for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900041#PP00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1636486800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I want to show the Minister of State a map which he may have seen before.  It is a map the Northern and Western Regional Assembly published a number of years ago.  If one looks at it the deficit in infrastructure in the north-west of Ireland, working its way down to the west, is very clear.  Let us look at it.  There is no motorway network to the fourth largest city on the island, Derry, and County Donegal.  There are about 500,000 people in the cross-Border region of west County Tyrone, County Donegal and County Derry.  There is no rail connection and no motorway connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900041#PP00500","speaker":"1463"}]
