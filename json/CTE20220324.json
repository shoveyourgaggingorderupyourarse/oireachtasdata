We have one apology from Deputy Alan Dillon and Deputy Matt Carthy may be late because he is attending a meeting of the agriculture committee as well.<\/p> <p>   In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face coverings when moving around the Leinster House campus and when in close proximity to others.  I ask members and witnesses to respect other people's physical space and adhere to public health advice at all times.  Members attending remotely must continue to do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to examine its 2020 financial statements and related matters.  We are joined in the committee room by officials from the SEAI.  They are Mr. William Walsh, chief executive officer; Ms Marion O&rsquo;Brien, director of corporate services; Dr. Ciaran Byrne, director of national retrofit; and Mr. Declan Meally, director of business, public sector and transport.  We are also joined in the committee room by Ms Jenny O&rsquo;Hora, and Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officers from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before starting, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648114200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which was established in May 2002, works with Irish households, businesses, communities and the Government with the objective of creating a cleaner and more efficient energy future and supporting the development of clean energy technologies.  The authority's income in 2020 totalled &euro;150.7 million, down from &euro;182.4 million in 2019.  In 2020, &euro;145.5 million, or almost 97% of the authority's income, came from Exchequer cash grants via the Vote for Environment, Climate and Communications.

I am joined today by my SEAI colleagues - Ms Marion O'Brien, director of corporate services; Dr. Ciaran Byrne, director of national retrofit; and Mr. Declan Meally , director of business, public sector and transport.  To assist the discussion today and in line with the letter of invitation, we submitted some briefing material to the committee earlier this week.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make an opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is at the forefront of delivering a low-carbon economy through measures and activities focused on the transition to a smarter and more sustainable energy future.  SEAI is funded by the Government of Ireland through its parent Department, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Transport.  In 2022, our budget allocation is more than &euro;440 million.<\/p> <p>  SEAI operates to the highest level of effective corporate governance.  We were the first organisation in Europe, private or public, certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland to the SWiFT 3000 standard and maintain this governance certification annually.<\/p><p>In an environment where accountability, transparency and probity are fundamental to SEAI's licence to operate, we work hard to apply best-practice governance processes that deliver consistently high levels of assurance around compliance with relevant laws, regulations and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.<\/p><p> Like others, SEAI had to adapt to the unprecedented challenges posed by Covid-19.  Our staff responded in an agile way, ensuring continuity of service while working remotely.  Given the disruption to normal life in 2020, fewer homeowners, communities and businesses availed of grants, such that expenditure across SEAI's various programmes decreased by around 15% year on year.  Much of our work requires access to citizens' homes.  Given the nature of Covid-19, access to homes was very restricted during 2020.  Thankfully, with fewer restrictions, SEAI's support programmes rebounded strongly in 2021, resulting in the highest ever levels of expenditure by SEAI.  This year is set to be another year of significant growth in activity levels.<\/p><p> SEAI puts citizens, communities, suppliers and other stakeholders at the heart of everything it delivers.  We focus on developing collaborative partnerships, strong engagement and smooth customer journeys for the public we serve.  We provide expert advice to drive positive change through our analysis, modelling and support for policymaking.  We are catalysts for action through grant and incentive programmes we deliver and through our capacity-building processes with citizens, communities and the business and public sectors.  Pursuing our mission, we collaborate closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including Departments and State agencies.  We have had a major and transformative impact on the Irish economy.  In the past decade, our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings.<\/p><p> Ireland now has even more ambitious targets and we have been scaling up our operations to meet the challenge.  In the past three years, we have added capacity to deliver capital expenditure programmes and enhance support to our parent Department.  Meeting Ireland's energy and climate targets will require further significant investment by the Government and SEAI is playing a major part, alongside others, to get Ireland on the right track regarding our UN COP21 Paris Agreement commitment trajectory.<\/p><p> SEAI is at the heart of delivering on the Government's Climate Action Plan 2021.  The plan sets ambitious goals for 2030, including 80% renewable electricity, 600,000 heat pumps, 500,000 B2 home upgrades, almost 1 million electric vehicles, a new microgeneration scheme, large emission reductions in our public service and enterprise sectors and increased investment in research and innovation.<\/p><p> At SEAI, we have a unique vision for the role we will play in delivering Ireland's energy revolution.  This requires fundamental change across all Irish society.  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the security of supply and cost implications of Ireland's reliance on fossil fuel imports have become very real.  This further underpins the urgency of our energy transition.  We are collaborating with colleagues in our parent Department and State agencies to mitigate the cost and security of supply impacts that will affect all of society.  Through energy independence, we can remove our reliance on imported fossil fuels, lower our carbon emissions and secure our future.  The global pandemic had devastating impacts in Ireland and globally, but the resulting limitations demonstrated that collective and cohesive action can have a significant impact on our energy-consumption behaviours.<\/p><p> The way in which we live must change, but it will be a change for the better.  This change will mean our buildings will be warm, comfortable and not heated by oil or gas.  Our communities will be leading the generation of renewable energy and our transport fleet will be electrified, charged by a renewable-energy-powered electricity system.  Sustainable energy needs to be the norm.  The quicker we achieve this, the sooner the broad range of benefits will flow to Irish citizens and businesses in the form of cheaper-to-run, warmer and healthier buildings, improved air quality, increased competitiveness, improved security of energy supply and many others.  At SEAI, we are acutely aware that the energy transition must be a just transition.  This is carefully considered across our programmes of delivery, research and policy advice.<\/p><p> SEAI has a strong body of evidence to illustrate the costs and benefits of the sustainable energy transition.  It is based on research and expertise from two decades of programme delivery.  We are clear that, for much of what is needed, the benefits far outweigh the costs, especially when the multiple benefits &mdash; financial, economic, employment, health, security of supply and environmental &mdash; are considered.<\/p><p> We passionately believe clean energy transition must happen and we stand ready to support all of Irish society on the journey.  The demands on Ireland's energy and environment require us to work at pace and to deliver ever greater results, learning and improvements.  This work is key to driving Ireland's contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, securing a healthy planet for future generations.<\/p><p> I thank our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport for their ongoing support, particularly in the context of the actions assigned to SEAI under the Climate Action Plan 2021.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the strategic leadership provided by the board members of SEAI, particularly their support in developing a new statement of strategy for the organisation.  The statement will be published shortly.  I pay tribute to the staff of SEAI for their commitment and dedication, particularly for their efforts and support as we addressed the significant challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> We are a strong and fully co-ordinated team, ready to embrace the next stage of our development.  In collaboration with key stakeholders, we will co-ordinate and lead the efforts to achieve the ambitious targets set out in Climate Action Plan 2021 and the national development plan.<\/p><p> I welcome the discussion with the committee and am happy to answer any questions members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648114200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

The fuel prices at the moment make it even more of an economic benefit to actually buy and own a car.

The public charge points scheme is in particular, for those who are not aware, for people for whom home charging is just not possible.  In my constituency there are many terraced houses where people park on-street and they would need access to that system.  I understand that as part of the scheme grants of up to &euro;5,000 are awarded to support the development of on-street public charging.  Dublin City Council actually applied and was approved for nine public charge points.  What happened with this funding?  I have been chasing it up and Dublin City Council informed me it has not received any funding under this initiative despite receiving a letter of offer last summer.  The SEAI was repurposing the scheme to reflect the actualities of the market better; that is the phrase that I have from my questions.  On top of this, the Minister for Transport informed me on Tuesday that &euro;143,000 plus some change has been allocated by his Department in total to date.  Where is the funding, where does that money lie?  I understand the Dublin local authority electric vehicle charging strategy is underway and is due to be published soon.

The public charging is for people who do not have off-street parking.  We brought in a grant two years ago for local authorities to be able to apply and put in a charger, if there is demand from people on their streets who say they want a charger, and the local authorities get a &euro;5,000 rebate from ourselves for it.  That is still an open call available to local authorities to draw down.  What has happened in the meantime is the local authorities are looking at their own strategies, whether it is better to provide local hubs of charging, or is it better to do it on-street, or perhaps to replace and have trickle chargers on street lights.

It speaks to that governance side of things.  Coming from the construction industry and having worked in the services and sustainable design area, I am aware that the level of paperwork and regulation can be onerous, particularly for small contractors.  Contractors often take on the burden of regulation and paperwork for the homeowner, for example.  Is the SEAI constantly working to ensure that burden is being lessened as much as possible?  As more programmes are added, a level of complexity will be added.  It is not always obvious.  We need to give people choice, but it is not always obvious which programme one should choose.  Is work being done consistently to ensure there is the least amount of red tape and paperwork for homeowners but also for contractors?  Some contractors are basically a micro-company with fewer than ten employees and the burden on them to access the schemes should be as little as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#G01300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648114200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>That is a fair question.

One must also bear in mind the other side of the equation, which is that we are dispersing Exchequer money to private entities, be they contractors or, ultimately, homeowners, so we have significant Government requirements to which we must adhere.<\/p> <p>  As regards what we are looking at, in the case of the new one-stop shops, for example, we took a design-thinking approach to start from the outside in and ask how can we make this as simple as possible.  We are starting to look at all of our other schemes in that context.  It is an iterative process; it will not happen as a once-off.  It is something one constantly trims and changes.  The idea is that we adhere to all the governance requirements, of which there are several, and also make it as easy as possible for companies such as those the Deputy described - two-man-and-a-van companies or firms with eight or ten employees - that do not have the back-up and resources for all of that.

A very good report was issued by Age Action Ireland in respect of the need for a new energy poverty strategy.  The existing poverty strategy is out of date, as I think we all know.  I hope to get a sense from the SEAI of where it sits in respect of ensuring scarce resources are deployed in a manner that ensures those people who are on very low incomes and who live in fuel-impoverished houses can be targeted in a way that makes sure the resources flow down to those who are most in need.  The new national retrofitting plan, which is part of the climate action plan for 2021, has a target of bringing 500,000 homes to a B2 building energy rating by 2030.  Our guests can question my figures, but we know that something like 18,400 retrofits were completed in 2020, approximately 4,000 of which raised the homes concerned to a B2 standard.  We must, of course, take the pandemic and the associated challenges around meeting targets into account.<\/p><p>That was challenging in terms of meeting targets.  I want to get a sense from SEAI, from a corporate point of view, whether it sees its role as one that ensures it is not just people with means who take the lion&rsquo;s share of the grants available for retrofitting because right now that is the case, and we can argue justifiably that that is the case.

There is a revised energy poverty strategy in production at the moment.  I am not entirely sure if it is has been completed yet, but it is being developed.  On the schemes themselves, we have a very significant target.  We have identified 500,000 B2-rated homes by 2030.  A budget of &euro;8 billion has been allocated to achieve that target.  Half of that budget, &euro;4 billion, is to go to the energy-poor sector.  That, in itself, ring-fences that sector.  Homes that meet a number of different eligibility criteria will be able to achieve that.  Those homeowners get fully funded.  Their retrofit, predominately as we move on and go to a B2 level, will be funded by the State.  It is fair to say that half of the entire budget will go towards the energy-poor sector.<\/p> <p>  There is another subgroup in the can-pay sector, and we touched on this earlier.  There are certain people who can afford a retrofit right now because they have the means and resources.  There are other people who, for various reasons, do not apply for the fully funded scheme, but who are in the can-pay sector.  Within that context, we are looking at and are in the process of developing a low-interest Government-backed loan scheme to allow them to be able to fund their own retrofit.  The Minister also recently announced significantly enhanced grant levels for attic and cavity insulation.  That figure is up to 80%.  Those two measures alone are relatively quick, easy to do and can have a very significant impact on the energy and thermal performance of a home.  We are taking that important principle on board.

We are trying to incentivise as many people as possible to purchase an electric car and to get them into the fleet.  That is what we are working on with the Minister and the Department to ensure that the &euro;5,000 grant is going to result in getting as many cars as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally"},{"type":"speech","time":1648114200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>A lot of the vehicles on the list are SUVs that will never be off the road because they were purchased in the Dublin area.  The other figures I got relate to where cars were bought.  The latest figure I received for the total number of electric cars in County Laois, for example, is 457 and there were 349 in County Offaly.  In Dublin there were 21,519.  If we look at the figures for cars bought last year, 210 were bought in County Laois, 167 were bought in County Offaly and 9,816 were bought in Dublin.  The list from the Department shows that of the charging points available, there are just ten in County Laois, eight in County Offaly and 159 in Dublin.  If we look at the grants that were paid last year, 153 people in County Laois received grants, a lesser figure in County Offaly of 145 received grants, and there were 5,087 in County Dublin.  I want to be clear that I am not having a go at people who live in County Dublin, but there is a very high percentage of the large vehicles, which are worth between &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000.  It is possible to buy a good electric car for &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000, and as Mr. Meally pointed out, the price is going down.  He mentioned the value to the State.  In effect, what is happening is that people living in rural counties are driving the longest distances because they are not living within the 15-minute city that is promoted by the Minister.  It is good for people who do live in such areas.  We want people to live nearer to where they work.  The point I make is that a greater level of benefit would be achieved environmentally if people in rural areas who are on average incomes or the median wage were able to buy an electric car and had the charging points, which they clearly do not have, because across two counties in the midlands there are only 18 charging points, as opposed to 159 in Dublin.  Given the way this has worked out, people in rural areas, who will be caught for higher carbon taxes, excise and everything else, are effectively subsidising others - in general, a better-off cohort who live in County Dublin and who travel short distances in areas where there is public transport available - to buy very large vehicles, according to the figures given by the Department of Transport.  There is a significant transfer here.  It goes completely against logic.  There are issues to be addressed in that regard.  I know there are many poor people in Dublin.  There are tens of thousands of people in Dublin on very low wages, but the figures show that the vast majority of cars are being bought in city areas or close to city areas where there is the least environmental benefit or need because there is public transport available and they are travelling short distances.  Does Mr. Meally accept the logic of what I am saying, that there is an issue there to be addressed?  People on the median wage in rural areas are effectively subsidising the purchase of luxury vehicles where they are least needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#O00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648114200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Obviously the spread of where cars are being bought is based on population numbers.  I do not accept that people in rural areas are subsidising the urban spread.  As you are aware, Chairman, cars are being bought right around the country.  The percentage of sales varies, obviously in regard to the overall numbers because we would expect more to be bought in Dublin due to the higher population there.<\/p> <p>  The carbon tax goes towards home upgrades to address fuel poverty.  It is not the case, as you stated, Chairman, that it goes to wealthier car owners in the Dublin area.  It is right across the board.  For every petrol or diesel car that we can replace, it is important to the State and it is a benefit to the State to make sure that cars are electric.  There will be continual reviews regarding the grants.  That is what the Department officials, the Minister and the SEAI look at in terms of the caps to see what opportunities there are to change them.<\/p> <p>  When people do the maths on the overall cost of running a petrol or diesel car - there are cars available at all different price bands - it is way cheaper to run an electric car whether one lives in Laois, Offaly, Dublin or in my area of Longford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally"},{"type":"speech","time":1648114200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I accept that.  There is a problem here and now and for the coming years for many people in those areas or people who are living in Dublin and have to travel to Kildare to work.  This is not exclusive to the midlands.  People in Dublin who have to travel out of Dublin for work are affected.  Workers on the median to average wage who are not in a position to buy an electric vehicle, who do not have the cash upfront, and who cannot raise the finance are effectively caught.  They have to do considerably longer journeys.  I am a great advocate of getting people working close to home and, if possible, from home.<\/p><p>We need to move people away from commuting, which is important.  For now, as things are designed within the economy, that is where matters stand.  Those to whom I refer are not in a position to make that change at this point.  They have to pay the extra carbon tax while those who can afford to purchase electric vehicles up to the value of &euro;60,000 get a grant of &euro;10,000, which is substantial.  I would argue that the cap should be looked at again in terms of the vehicle involved.  I worked in the motor trade a long time ago.  I am no longer involved but one of my family is.  Should we be subsidising luxury cars?  That is the question.  People who have to travel a distance need reasonably good vehicles; they do not need luxury cars.  I am not sure that we should be subsidising them to that level while people who cannot afford these vehicles are stuck in high-emission petrol or diesel vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#O00500","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648114200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his analysis.  It is very helpful to us in reflecting on the issues that are faced in communities.  A couple of points occurred to me as he was outlining the position.  The policy changes will adjust a great deal of the information that the Chairman has on the types of vehicles involved.  Some of those luxury brands simply are not the subject of a grant any more because they are not fully electric battery models.  I would be interested to see the figures for next year when we have a full year of information on the new policy change and the reduction in the cap.<\/p> <p>  On the price, we have discussed the fact that it is less that the price is coming down but that there are more models available now in a lower price band.  Undoubtedly, supply chain costs have increased the price of everything, including steel and semiconductors.  That has been reflected through to the prices of certain models.  However, there are more vehicles available in the cheaper bands because there are new models.<\/p> <p>  Technology will be of extremely useful for people in rural communities.  What we are seeing now - my colleague Mr. Meally, has outlined this - is that range anxiety is not as strong an issue.  Albeit that matters are evolving, there are plans to put more infrastructure in place and to have home charging points to encourage 80% of people to do it.<\/p> <p>  We have the policy adjustments, the changes to technology and the introduction of a second-hand market.  There is simply no second-hand market for electric vehicles at the moment but as the numbers increase, we will see a functioning second-hand market.  The motor industry has also stated that this is the very first time that a completely new type of vehicle has been brought in to replace a completely old type of vehicle.<\/p> <p>  My final point on the carbon tax is that it is not hypothecated for electric vehicles.  Exchequer funding pays for the grants that have been issued to people for vehicles, but not the carbon tax specifically.  Much of the carbon tax has been ring-fenced for some of our retrofit works and for other environmental initiatives, which they are dictated by policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1648114200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I understand that the SEAI does not set the policy, but I ask that it keep this matter under review.

One of my concerns relates to the timeframe, namely, from the time an application is lodged to the inspection taking place.  I was contacted by one person recently and it took two years from the time the application for the inspection to be carried out.  Are there targets in place?  I am aware that Covid happened during those two years.  The house of the person involved was built with cavity blocks, not cavity walls, so one can imagine the waste of energy involved.  The person made an application for approval by the SEAI but it was two years before someone came to inspect the house.  This person was also told that the SEAI would engage with the contractor to do the work.  What is the expected timeframe from start to finish?  Have targets been set?  I accept that there may have been a problem with inspectors.  Additional moneys have been allocated and staff are to be employed.  Will targets be set over the next 12 months?  If so, what will they be?  How will the SEAI assess matters in the context of delivery?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#P01200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648114200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>That question pertains to what we call the warmer homes scheme, which is the energy poverty scheme.

The cycle time, from the time of the first application to completion, was 17.5 months.  It was up to 24 months, again, because we had substantial closures of the building sector.  Even when the commercial building sector opened up, the warmer homes scheme was somewhat delayed because we were going in to individuals homes who were vulnerable.  The cycle time then is 17.5 months and we have built up a waiting list because of the Covid-19 period.  As of the end of December 2021, there were 7,500 homes on that list.

I am specifically thinking about retrofitting in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the public charging points.  The local authorities are slow on this.  When somebody is considering buying an electric car, for example, the range of that car is important.  People have to know that when they get somewhere they will be able to charge up and come back.  That should not involve having to knock on somebody's door and ask to plug one's car in.  I live in Leixlip and yesterday I looked up where the public charging point is, and there is one in the railway station.

Plaster and electric fittings went up by 20%, insulation by 11% and pipes and fittings by 10%.  That is all effectively history because of what has happened in the past month in Ukraine.  Things have taken another hop up.

The issue is to try to get every house double glazed.  Obviously, it is a good place to start.<\/p> <p>  I have another question and it relates to mass concrete housing.  Your Department does not do the local authority retrofit scheme.  A typical mass concrete house has 9 in. walls.  There were tens of thousands of them built in the 1930s and 1940s.  If they are privately owned the owner can get the 80% scheme or the 50% scheme, but the ones owned by the local authorities are the last being done.  I see estates not too far from where I live that were built in the 1990s and they are being retrofitted.  I saw the man in the van yesterday morning at one of them.  We welcome the fact they are being done.  When they were built, they were double glazed.  It would not have been great quality double glazing because at that time it was skinny double glazing.  They were not the most energy-efficient but they had a reasonable level of energy efficiency.<\/p> <p>  However, down the road, for example, at O'Moore Place in Portlaoise, the houses have 8 in. mass concrete walls and one would freeze in them.  They are not being done.  Demographically, they are low-income households, many of them with health problems, and there is no prospect of it soon.  The local authorities are anxious to do it, and we have certainly been banging the drum to try to get them done.  That type of house is replicated throughout the country.  One sees those houses in Sligo and all over.  The same design was used and in their day they were good houses.  However, they would be very poor in terms of energy efficiency.  Can anything be done?  I understand the logic of picking the low-hanging fruit, but if houses that were built in the 2000s are being done but houses built in 1937 or 1938 are not being done, there is a huge discrepancy.  What is being done to address that at Department level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#S01500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648114200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>We are obviously in regular contact with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage who oversee the energy efficiency programme for local authority houses.

They are gradually moving towards the deeper measures and the installation of heat pumps.  There are particular issues, as you mention, with the concrete walls.  As the low-hanging fruit have been picked off, they will have to move to the harder-to-treat houses.

That is always very helpful.  Page 5 gives information with regard to tolls and the M50 e-Flow system, with figures for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.  These are very similar to some of the figures I got back by way of parliamentary questions.  I believe, however, that they are exclusive of legal costs relating to debt recovery and private investigation costs.  Can we just double-check with TII that this is the case?  If it is, can we amend the figures and show those particular aspects separately also?  That would be useful.<\/p> <p>  My second point is about the M7 bypass.  It is 36 years since there was an initial project.  These projects have a very long lifespan and we have had a number of them in Kildare.  After 20 years or so, they will strip out the pavement and do a substantial four or five inches of tarmac, or even more, to give it some extra longevity.  TII have said that it does not have the original data on costs and so on.  It would be quite useful to ask TII how long it holds on to material.  There can be a validity to this, and institutional memory can be lost.  Holding on to some records is quite important.  It would be useful if we could establish with TII the length of time it holds on to records.<\/p> <p>  My final point is on the metro and the Luas green line.  There is a huge amount of development happening in the Cherrywood, Sandyford and Dundrum area.  They are saying that they have no plans for any expansions there and they may well elongate it.  It would be useful to ask TII if it is aware of the extent of the work that is happening there - it is actually breathtaking how much it changes even over a 12-month period - and why TII would not take into consideration the extent of the development.  What we tend to get here, and we all complain about it, is infrastructure in retrospect rather than in parallel.  It can be a real source of frustration because people have an expectation when there is a lot of housing that there will be the services and facilities to go along with that.  A lot of that development is intended to be low-car or no-car use.  It is deliberately built along the public transport corridor there.  It is important that we do not have a short-term view on that, given the magnitude of the development happening there.  We should go back to TII to ask it what the rationale is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#AA01000","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1648114200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>One area of the correspondence I am concerned about is the forecasted costs for completion of the projects under the national development plan.  TII has indicated various reasons as to why it is difficult to give estimates but the cost ranges that have been provided are quite broad.  That is being generous.<\/p><p>Prices range from &euro;250 million to 1 &euro;billion, which is as broad as one can get.  Another project has a cost range of between &euro;1 billion and &euro;3 billion, which again is very unspecific and makes it very difficult, I would argue, to plan accordingly for what are considered essential infrastructure projects.<\/p><p> During the discussion with TII, it will be recalled I asked the question as to whether a political intervention could reverse the decisions in regard to funding allocations for this year.  In fairness, TII was quite honest about it and indicated that this would be the case.  Since then, some of the projects that had been denied funding this year have had that funding restored.  Unfortunately, the specific case I raised regarding the N2 Clontibret to the Border road scheme has not been included among those projects, which is disappointing because this is a vital infrastructural project.  It services and goes through my county, but it is essential for the economic and regionally balanced development of the central Border region and the broader north west.  It has been part of numerous discussions and negotiations on the peace process and it has formed part of several key Government policy initiatives, including the national development plan as well as Our Rural Future and a number of others.<\/p><p> The timeframe given for the completion of this project is now set at 2033.  I ask that we write to TII to get a detailed breakdown of the phases from now to completion, the dates by which those phases are expected to be met, considering the next stage has essentially been stalled, and if the TII could be more specific in terms of the estimated costs of each of those phases.  As well as the infrastructural need for this project, there is also the other issue that hundreds of landowners and communities are essentially sterilised because this projected route has been earmarked.  If we are saying to them they cannot develop until 2033, that is something of great concern.  I ask we write in regard to that specific project, if that is in order.<\/p><p> The former CEO of TII was paid in excess of &euro;29,000 in accrued leave, representing 41 days.  Assuming the holiday year runs from April to March, even accounting for no holidays taken since the onset of the pandemic, it seems to be a large amount of accrued leave and would be out of line with holiday pay policy in most places of employment.

We made a specific effort to identify some issues, including whether insufficient numbers of staff are working on the site.  That was the case at times during this contract and it is part of the reason this contract has run as long as it has, with construction inflation now a real issue.  That is built into the contract.

I refer as well to the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes and any changes in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and employment orders.

This committee does not have a remit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit the accounts of local authorities.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  I would welcome an opportunity for this committee to have an engagement with the local government auditors, the Department responsible and representatives of the local authorities themselves to assess how we might ensure there is proper transparency and accountability in respect of the Exchequer funding of local authorities.  We do not have real local government in this country.  I say that as someone who was a proud member of a local authority for many years.  Essentially, we have local administration of national policies and very limited powers for elected representatives at a local level.  Where power does reside in local authorities it is generally in the hands of unelected officials.  In that context, there is a need for full accountability and transparency in this sector as in all public sectors.  I am raising this issue to try to initiate a debate in the first instance but we should look at arranging an engagement, which could be informal if needs be, with the local government auditor, the Department and representatives of the local authorities to see whether we can bring forward proposals that this committee would play a role in ensuring that accountability and transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022032400002#FF00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1648114200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I only saw the last 20 minutes of the programme because the D&aacute;il adjourned late last night.

The abuses highlighted in the programme by officials and former officials do a disservice to local government.  It is very unfair to the officials in the local authorities who are there working every day.  The councillors have to deal with the public on these matters and the vast majority stand for election and are elected to do their best in their own local area and county.

Everyone can see there is a code number beside everything on local authority budgets.  It is a case of following that, questioning that, and following the expenditure over the years.  The surest way of putting the brakes on some of the stuff we saw is councillors raising those questions.  They may be counted as awkward at times for raising these and they may not be thanked for it sometimes in council chambers, either by some other councillors or indeed by the executive of the council.  However, it is very important they do so because they have the mechanism of a public forum and they have the audit committee, which is another mechanism they can use.

For the purpose of my submission, I shall focus on greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions from cattle.  The principle points I wish to discuss today are, first, the importance of choosing the right metrics in advance of making decisions on the size of the national herd and, second, that technology has a key role to play in sustainable agriculture and its adoption should be incentivised.<\/p> <p>  I am the co-founder and chairman of Moonsyst International Ltd, an Irish company that was formed in partnership with Moonsyst Hungary in November 2020.  Moonsyst International develops Internet of things cattle monitoring solutions, with particular focus on animal health and sustainability.  The company is supported by the Cork north and west local enterprise office and, in September 2021, received the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Enterprise Ireland best newcomer award at the ploughing championships innovation arena.  Prior to getting involved in the agricultural technology sector, I spent more than 20 years in manufacturing as a process improvement engineer and consultant, during which time I worked on teams deploying multi-million euro manufacturing IT systems into some of the world&rsquo;s largest companies.<\/p> <p>  A lesson I learnt on my first job and carried through on every other assignment was that if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.  Metrics really matter, so long as they are the right metrics.  Rather than looking at the size of the national herd or national biogenic reductions, better metrics are required before decisions are made or legislation enacted.  As part of the draft agrifood strategy 2030, Ireland should focus on efficiencies in producing high-quality animal protein, that is, milk and meat, rather than committing to national biogenic methane reductions or reducing the size of the national herd.  There is no mention of how biogenic methane can cost-effectively be measured and I am deeply concerned that if the right metrics are not available, the wrong decisions will be made.<\/p> <p>  Global demand for milk and beef is expected to grow constantly for at least another 30 years, as more people around the world enter middle class and seek these high-quality animal proteins in their diets.  Ireland has one of the best and most natural systems in the world for producing bovine milk and meat.  If we do not serve this increasing global demand, countries in which animal welfare and sustainability lag Ireland&rsquo;s record will do so, which will have a global negative net impact on sustainability and the global environment.<\/p> <p>  Article 2.1 of the Paris Agreement refers to the importance of protecting food production while reducing emissions.  I strongly believe Ireland is best positioned to do this by being a world leader on sustainable bovine meat and dairy production through utilising our natural advantages, particularly our grass-fed system.  This does not equate to reducing cattle numbers in Ireland but arguably means Ireland should increase its production of bovine dairy and meat, which would have a net benefit on global emissions.  For this reason, I think the current metrics under consideration, that is, biogenic methane reduction or national herd size reductions, are wrong.<\/p> <p>  Focus should be placed on optimising animal efficiencies in the production of dairy and meat.<\/p><p>There is long list of factors that impact on these efficiencies, including genetics, breed, health, feed, seasonality, age, lactation cycle, sward types, use of feed additives, environmental factors, herdsmanship, supply chain factors and so forth.  For example, cattle that eructate, that is, belch, excessively are cattle that have poor feed conversion, health issues and produce excessive greenhouse gas emissions.  A healthy rumen equals a healthy cow and less greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p> Cattle, like cars, can vary extensively but not all cars are treated equally when it comes to greenhouse gases.  A ten-year-old car with a 4 l engine will attract higher road taxes and fuel taxes than a new car with a 1 l engine, and rightly so.  They will both do the same job, that is, getting you from A to B, but they have different impacts on the environment.  Great advancements are being made in this industry to reduce greenhouse gases because each car can be measured for its impact on the environment and incentives applied to improve.  The same cannot be said for the proposed metrics associated with the national herd even though emissions from cattle can also vary extensively.  More attention needs to be placed on measuring and establishing the correct metrics before decisions are made at a national level.  When cattle's rumen health is good, it helps farmers maximise feed conversion and minimise the amount of greenhouse gas produced by each animal.  This has the potential to improve protein conversion yields in both meat and milk, which in turn represents a further gain for the farmer, without negatively impacting the environment.  With such information to hand, Governments and large corporate entities such as retailers could incentivise progressive farmers to produce more sustainably, for example, by rewarding farmers for investments in genetics, new swards or methane-blocking feed additives.  Moonsyst is working on providing a cost-effective method of monitoring the rumen of cattle in real time.  With this information to hand, farmers can better understand the health of their animals and optimise the feed conversion rates, which in turn will minimise biogenic emissions, helping the environment.  As I mentioned, if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.<\/p><p> At present there are no direct financial incentives to reward beef and dairy farmers who manage low biogenic emitting herds.  Incentives should be considered to drive this progressive behaviour.  For example, technologies that are deemed to enable more sustainable farming could be made exempt from VAT or classified as a capital expenditure.  From discussions with farmers, we know that all they want to do is the right thing by the environment as it is crucial for their businesses going forward.  However, they are not being incentivised sufficiently.  As is called out in the draft agrifood strategy 2030, technology has a key role to play in the coming years and any incentives that can be put in place to expedite the adoption of these technologies have to be a good thing.<\/p><p> In summary, I ask this committee to consider the two principal points I presented today.  The first is that, before decisions are made on biogenic emissions, we must ensure the right metrics are put in place to drive sustainability and ensure a net positive benefit in respect of global climate change.  The second is that we should put in place simple incentives to encourage Irish farmers to adopt technologies that will enable them to become more sustainable.  I thank all of the committee members for again allowing me the time and opportunity to express my views on this important matter for Irish farming, Ireland and the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Desmond Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Savage for coming in.

The rumen is the first stomach of cattle.<\/p><p>People describe the rumen as a kind of bioreactor.  When cattle consume grass or feed, it goes into a pre-stomach known as the rumen.  Within this, the feedstuff is broken down in a kind of bioreaction in nature.  If that process is happening efficiently then we have a healthy animal.  What we are doing is monitoring the rumen in real time, 24-7, and providing that information back to the farmer.  If an animal has a healthy rumen, it is converting that feedstuff efficiently, which is what we want from feed conversion, from a farmer's point of view, but it is also the right thing for the environment.  If an animal is belching excessively, for example, that means the energy that should be going into converting protein is going into converting methane.<\/p><p> There is a win-win here.  It is a triple win, actually, because we have a healthy animal, which is good for welfare, a high feed conversion, which is good for the bottom line for the farmer, and it has also optimised the level of greenhouse gases being emitted, which is good for the environment.  It all comes down to monitoring the rumen, in my opinion.  Rather than saying at a herd level or even a national herd level, let us put metrics associated with that, I suggest that we monitor it at animal level and work up from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#C01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Desmond Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Savage.

Are they not already embraced by the Teagasc list that covers genetics, feed, age, sward, animal health, slurry, fertilisers, early slaughter and all these matters?  Teagasc has attempted to delineate what the policy ought to be and what the impact might be.  Are we not already embracing those?  That seems to be existing policy.<\/p> <p>  I can fully understand why Mr. Savage said we should focus on highest protein efficiency for those who can do it most efficiently.  However, is it the case that this would have to be done at EU level?  What we have at EU level are specific greenhouse gas targets for Ireland, which it must meet.  The decision we have is how we allocate that between different gases and see what the knock-on effect is for different sectors.  That is what we are trying to assess.  It seems that we do not have the luxury of ignoring global GHG figures.  We are tied in under Paris and the EU approach.  One could argue that we ought to change the EU approach.  That is a legitimate argument.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Savage said there is a relentless rise in animal protein demand.  The fundamental question I presume people would ask is whether that relentless growth is consistent with the Paris objectives.  We cannot afford to assume just because the middle class is growing across the globe that we will be able to expand production to meet existing patterns of protein consumption.

It is true and simple - if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.

That is what I am trying to contribute to all that really good work that is going on there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about the EU and GHG targets.  This actually feeds into my very point on metrics.  I appreciate we are talking to people here who are legislating through Ireland and the EU but I am a citizen of the world.  Greenhouse gases does not pay any attention to borders.  We might meet our targets here in Ireland but that kind of net negative impact on the global environment is a really good example.  That is an example of where metrics are actually having a net wrong effect.  It is easy for me to say but when it comes to greenhouse gases, there should not be Ireland targets or EU targets; there should be world targets.  I know it is not an easy one to solve but it makes my point that using the wrong metrics can have the wrong effect, even though people think they are doing the right thing.  If I am concerned about the world environment, I think that Ireland, with its grass-fed system and efficient farming with good genetics, is best positioned to produce high-quality milk and protein, which is a requirement for the growing middle class globally.<\/p> <p>  That chimes perfectly with Article 2.1 of the Paris climate change agreement in that food security, which we are hearing a lot about at the moment, needs to be maintained.  Should we risk a very successful industry in either restricting or reducing it and impacting on future food security because we are trying to meet targets that are linked to the EU or Ireland which, arguably, are not going to be that beneficial for a global environment?  A rethink needs to be had on this before any legislation is enacted.  My main point is that global GHGs are not restricted to borders whereas we are setting targets that are.  That is a good example of how setting the wrong metrics can have the wrong effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Desmond Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Savage.

I could not agree more with him when it comes to measuring metrics and making sure the right information is being used to inform decisions, and about incentivising farmers to do the right thing.  That is an area in which we certainly have not been doing work over many years.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions, the first of which is with regard to the system he was talking about.  He said it is monitoring at an animal level.  Is it monitoring at an animal level for the purpose of real-time reductions in emissions from particular cows or for the purposes of breeding future animals that will have lower reductions?  Is it a bit of both?  How long would that process take?  My second question relates to the metrics.  To be fair, Mr. Savage was asked to look at the efforts to reduce emissions but if we look at farming from an Irish context, it seems not to work for the environment or the farmer at the moment.  If we just look at it very much from an emissions perspective, yes, then maybe just reducing animal emissions is the metric we would look at.  However, surely we should look at it more broadly.  There is river pollution, biodiversity loss and a continued intensification of the industry for people, which means there are lower incomes and more stress for farmers.  It is really not working for farmers.  Should we include metrics that are not just emissions but also look at farmers' lives, their incomes and the future of farming and maybe broaden them to use this as an opportunity to reform farming so that it works for farmers, the environment, the country, food security and all those things?  Those are my two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#D00600","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648080000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>We are quite aligned in our thought process.  On the Deputy's first point, the technology enables both health monitoring and breeding.  You could argue that successful and efficient breeding has a positive impact because you are producing cattle more efficiently, reproducing and getting back into a milking cycle quicker and, therefore, producing protein off the feed inputs quicker.  The technology is an enabler.  It will only be as good as the person using it but will enable the farmer to improve the health of his or her animals and to maximise breeding efficiency.<\/p> <p>  Sexed semen will give a higher probability of a calf being born female but a sexed semen straw used for insemination is fragile.  There is an optimal time to use the straw.  It is difficult for farmers to know when that time is unless they are monitoring the cattle 24-7.  A high level of herdsmanship is required.  My cousin, for example, has a farm and during lockdown had a very efficient breeding season because his two teenage kids monitored the cattle.  That system worked perfectly for him but now that the kids have gone back to school, he is thinking he needs to invest in a system because he has realised the value of what his kids were doing.  Technology is there to help.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, we offer just one part of the circular economy here.  There is the welfare of the farm, getting the kids involved and being tech-savvy, but there are also factors like safety.  If you can use the technology efficiently, there might not be a need for as many bulls on the farm.  Bulls on farms with small animals constitute a safety concern so that is a positive. <\/p> <p>  Going back to my experience in manufacturing, when anything new is introduced, change management is typically the biggest challenge.  The technology is typically 15% to 20% of the project, while 80% of the effort goes into change management and getting people to understand that these technologies are here to help move things on and make things more cost effective.  That is through education, example and incentivisation.  If a farmer is 50:50 on whether to invest in the technology, a simple measure like taking the VAT off it could be taken.  One could ask why a farmer should pay VAT on a technology which has the potential to enable that farmer to improve the environment.  Simple legislation to remove VAT or make these technologies capital expenditure could be the difference between a farmer going or not going for it.  <\/p> <p>  Technology has impacted all our lives.  The agricultural sector is lagging and change management is a factor, so whatever can be done to encourage and expedite change management is a good thing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Desmond Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Savage for his presentation.

I apologise because I am at the Committee of Public Accounts as well, so I will be in and out of both.  I thank Mr. Savage for his opening statement.<\/p><p>When we talk about greenhouse gas emissions, there are three strands to the discussion: the global targets and ambitions that are agreed; the national implementation of those targets; and, particularly in the context of agriculture, the on-farm basis on which those national targets are set.  That third strand has been completely lost, despite the fact that, in reality, we will not and cannot effectively and fairly meet our national targets without getting the on-farm process right - in other words, without being able to measure and account for the level of sequestration, storage and emission that takes place on every farm in order that we can reward good behaviour and tackle negative behaviour as it becomes evident.  It cannot become evident, however, unless we have some way of measuring it on an on-farm basis.<\/p><p> Mr. Savage's analogy of cattle being like cars is a good one.  At present, extrapolating the position of one versus the other, if somebody were to go to the expense of purchasing an electric car, we would continue to penalise him or her because of somebody else driving the 4 l gas guzzler to which Mr. Savage referred.  Therein lies the difficulty in getting large numbers of farmers to make the types of changes that are necessary.  We are not properly incentivising them to make those moves and those investments.<\/p><p> As for comments that more attention needs to be paid to measuring and establishing the correct metrics, what precisely do we need to measure better?  What are the correct metrics Mr. Savage has said we need to adopt?  He touched on that, but could he elaborate further?<\/p><p> Members of both committees will be familiar with Teagasc.  It has set out that existing technologies and evolving technologies and practices could be sufficient to get us to 18% of the emissions reductions required.  We know that the 2020 sectoral targets require us to get to between 22% and 30%.  In Mr. Savage's view, what is the scope and the capacity of technologies such as the ones his company uses, but others as well, to fill the gap between the 18% Teagasc says is achievable and the more ambitious target that is likely to be applied to the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#E00600","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648080000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>To address the Deputy's last point first, I am very confident, being involved in the sector and seeing the work ongoing, that, through technology, changes to peat practices, etc., reductions will be achieved.  However, going back to the Deputy's first point, we really need to flip the metrics on their head.  Pushing down national or EU metrics at the farm level means nothing to farmers.  If we were to reverse that and to come up with metrics at farm level that farmers could understand and achieve, we would achieve our national targets through osmosis, by working at the farm level rather than by pushing down.  Going back to my industry experience, there is, typically, a pyramid of metrics.  At the factory level, there is concern not about the top of the pyramid but about the metrics, yield, efficiency and so forth, that is, the stuff they can control.  If you can control the stuff at the bottom of the pyramid, at the factory level or the farm level, you will naturally achieve the metrics higher up.  I do not know how to go about fixing this.  At present, we are pushing down high-level metrics onto a farm level.  That simply will not work.  There needs to be more of a pull from the bottom up.  I do not have the answer as to how that can be achieved, but I am here to suggest the importance of metrics and that people know there are technologies out there that can enable this to happen.  Technologies are improving all the time.  I have no doubt that we can achieve these targets through technology without impacting national food security and while doing the right thing for the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Desmond Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy, if you wish to come in again, you have about a minute and a half left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#F00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>No, thank you.

What I am hearing from you, Mr. Savage, is that a bottom-up approach using technology will help governments to achieve their objectives.

Burke.<\/p> <p>  EASYFIX is a Galway-based company whose focus for the past 25 years has been to provide innovative products that improve animal welfare.  Given the time of year, the committee may know us best for our horse-friendly fences that have significantly reduced injuries to horses and riders in horse racing.  The committee may not know that we export a whole range of products to over 60 countries worldwide.  We are proud of the fact that we are now the world's number one supplier of livestock comfort products.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of talk about how we can reduce emissions and I respectfully submit that much of this debate has generated more heat than light.  We at EASYFIX believe this should not be a simplistic binary debate that centres on the need to cull the national herd to meet climate targets.<\/p><p>We are also concerned that there is an urgent need to focus on the here and now.  Looking at improving genetics or the use of feed additives are great ideas, but there are solutions that are tried and tested and currently available that can cut emissions radically.  We believe that technology can make an enormous contribution.  We urge both committees to support the concept of a dedicated emissions reduction fund to be put in place for Irish agriculture that ring-fences funds and links them to emission reduction targets.  We must act today if we are to make serious inroads to meet our emissions targets.  Other countries actively support farmers with capital grants of up to 40%.  It is our view that the Government needs to support farmers and help give them the tools to do the job.<\/p><p> When people talk about technology they often talk about the future potential of technology.  My team and I will not do that.  We will show members what is possible today.  We will demonstrate that with two technologies, namely, slat rubber mats and EASYFIX slurry technology.  The benefits of these two technologies have been proven in farm trials and using actual performance data by Wageningen University and Research and peer reviewed by Professor Gary Lanigan, National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway.  The combined benefits of both technologies are worth outlining.  They are: reduce on-farm emissions by 24%; a major reduction in artificial fertiliser of more than 25%; significantly reduces lameness and joint swelling in animals; a resultant fall of antibiotic use; a major gain in animal welfare that helps counter the reputational challenge to our green image from winter housing; and some 10% of farm deaths are slurry related - our system helps eliminate hydrogen sulphide, which will be safer for both farmers and their animals.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Ronan Boyle, to outline each system in turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Earls","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648080000,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I will explain to the members the two products we are here to speak about today.<br\/><br\/>Methane and ammonia present the greatest challenge for emissions reductions on farms, with 99% of national ammonia emissions coming from agriculture.  The burden of reduction rests solely with agriculture.  Some 48% of all ammonia comes from housing and manure storage.  Our EASYFIX slat rubber product is a cushioned rubber covering that is applied to the top of a concrete slat in animal housing.  A recent Teagasc trial confirmed a 13% increase in performance will equate to a 19% reduction in methane.  The most recent trial by Teagasc on the benefits of slat mats showed a 17% increase in animal performance, which would equate to a 24% reduction in methane.  One other significant benefit is that animals are much more comfortable on rubber and lameness and joint swelling is massively reduced.  In one farm trial, the use of rubber slats reduced antibiotic use from 11% of the herd to 0.5%, with lameness levels down from 8% to 0.5% - a very significant reduction.<br\/><br\/>Members also may be aware of articles in<i>European Supermarket Magazine<\/i>and farming publications that have called into question our animal welfare standards in winter housing.  For more than ten years we have been working with Wageningen University and Research on how rubber slat mats reduce ammonia emissions.  Slat mats reduce ammonia emissions by rapidly draining urine from the surface of the slat into the tanks below, preventing urine and faeces from mixing and thereby reducing urease activity that causes ammonia to be released.  The research from Wageningen University and Research shows a very significant reduction of ammonia emissions of between 34% and 49%.  We believe that between now and 2030 a planned and phased emissions reduction fund will achieve a 60% adoption rate by farmers, and this will play a significant part in Ireland achieving its target reductions between now and 2030.<br\/><br\/>I will play a short video to demonstrate the product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>We will have to go into private session to show the video.

It deploys a network of pipes throughout the tank that injects oxygenated air that helps break down the slurry and keep it in a liquid state.

The system has the added benefit of increasing the nutrient values of the slurry.  Given the current price of fertiliser coupled with Ireland's target of reducing the use of chemical fertiliser on farms, optimising the slurry is a must for all farmers.

I am sure they would like to know how an emissions fund might work and what it might cost.  Our view is that we would need a commitment to fund emission reductions from now until 2030.  We estimate that a fund of &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million per annum would be sufficient to ensure Irish farms will be the most sustainable farms in the world.  Our simple view is to focus on what we can do today.  We can reach our targets fully and more quickly through the mechanism proposed.  Any delay in the implementation of a dedicated fund will leave Irish farmers with unachievable targets to reach.  Decisions taken now can ensure that we will achieve our targets in a sustained manner.  It will improve our soil and air quality, cut emissions substantially and improve animal welfare.  It will also cut the number of farm fatalities and accidents and help support our reputation for producing great food in a sustainable and responsible manner.  We therefore urge the committee to call on the Government to implement a dedicated emissions-reduction fund for Irish agriculture.  This should be exclusively used to achieve emissions reductions and should not be part of any other capital support grants.  It should be implemented without delay.  We believe we could achieve our emissions targets through the use of technology without the need to cull the national herd.<\/p> <p>  Irish agriculture and Irish farmers are very innovative.  We have shown an ability to adapt and develop new products and offerings.  In this regard, consider how the dairy industry pioneered the development of cream liqueurs or how Ireland has become a global leader in protein-based nutrition.

I accept that it is independently peer-reviewed but I want to get clarity.  The witnesses are probably talking about methane associated with slurry waste as opposed to the other end, which is probably the bigger challenge in agriculture.  Notwithstanding that, it is a fair point that methane is associated with the degradation of waste, which we should seek to reduce.  I ask the witnesses to confirm that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with them in principle on having an emissions reduction fund.  We should be investing to get emissions reductions now.  Any fund the State would put in place would need to be robust, transparent and verifiable and would need to achieve what it sets out to achieve.  The State should carefully consider that because we are talking about a large amount of money, between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million per annum for eight years.  If it could be shown to work there is a strong case for it.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to enlighten us on what funding is in place for this kind of technology development and research in the private sector.  If there is no funding, that is remiss given the challenge we have.  Are similar funds in place overseas and in other jurisdictions that Ireland can look at?  In one of the videos we saw, a farmer from County Cork outlined that fertiliser costs on his farm had significantly reduced, which is positive.  We frequently hear in this committee how farmers are struggling with input costs.  It is welcome that there is a technology that can help them to reduce those costs and be economically sustainable.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to the question of environmental sustainability.  Has any research been done by the witnesses or can they point to any research that would support the idea that this technology can reduce the local impacts of fertiliser on water courses and so on?  We have a huge challenge in that regard also, notwithstanding the climate challenge we face.  The rivers of Ireland have degraded significantly in recent decades and a lot of that is due to slurry run-off and increased use of nitrates related to fertiliser and so on.  If there is research to show this technology can help the environment at local level, particularly with regard to water quality, I would like to hear about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#K00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648080000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I will address the points the Co-Chairman made in sequence.  On methane and manure, the 54% reduction is coming from methane which is stored in manure as opposed to enteric methane from the animal.<\/p> <p>  The Co-Chairman asked if funding is in place to support private companies for research and development in technology such as this.  Outside of Enterprise Ireland or local LEADER funding that private enterprises may avail of, I am not aware of any Irish funding we can tap into to support this.  Our investments have been significant in recent years, both in Ireland and across Europe, including in the Netherlands where we have spent ten years working on environmental projects around rubber flooring in particular.  That has all been self-funded by Easyfix.<\/p> <p>  From an environmental and sustainability point of view, the Co-Chairman referred to water courses, soil health, etc.  The big advantage we would see with slurry technology systems is that they will allow farmers to better manage their slurry on-farm because the absence of technology on the farm makes the management of manure much more difficult.  I probably need to explain the difficulties farmers face.  If a tank is full of manure, it needs to be agitated to be spread.  In order to agitate it a full tank is needed and Irish tanks are typically about 8 ft deep.  When that is agitated there is a window of three days before it starts to return to a solid state so farmers are under time pressure to extract the slurry at that time and spread it on the land.  Therefore, sometimes land gets a little more than it technically should get.  With the use of a slurry technology system, slurry is effectively available on tap.  Trevor Crowley is probably the ultimate example in that he has a dairy farm and runs a paddock system for his cows.  His cows go in and graze out of paddock and he follows them with slurry.  He probably puts out slurry two or three times per week so he is able to use it in the correct application rate and follow his cows, as opposed to applying chemical fertiliser.  He is able to use the slurry on his terms, not on the basis of having it agitated and having to empty the tank.  It is about the management of the slurry in that respect.<\/p> <p>  There is another important scientific point.  The manure that is being applied to the land that has been treated in a system like Easyfix is an aerobic product, as opposed to an anaerobic product which is untreated.  That has a whole host of implications for soil health and what happens thereafter on the land.  Worm counts and so on are all linked to that.  I hope that answers the Co-Chairman's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":551,"content":"<p>It certainly does.

In addition, by the year 2024, it will be mandatory for all new builds in Germany to have slat rubber, be it our rubber or some other rubber on the marketplace.  In Northern Ireland for the past seven years, slat rubber was on top of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, chosen product for subsidy.  It had been adopted during that period by many farmers in the North of Ireland.

On that Teagasc trial, they got about a 17% increase in performance.  Performance typically would equate to what you would anticipate getting off of a straw-based system.  Concrete animals would not perform as well just because, I suppose, it is a comfort thing.  They probably consume more energy when they are in housing and their feed conversion is poorer.  Typically, to give it in numbers, animals on a finishing diet, for example, might put on about 1.1 kg per day.  On a rubber slatted system, that could be increased to about 1.3 kg or 1.4 kg.  That is where you get extra performance and reduced days to beef.  Typically, on average, we would see the days to beef being reduced by anything from 21 to 28 days.  That represents a significant savings in terms of emissions from the animal.  It will also make farmers more efficient and profitable because animals are processed faster on the farm.<\/p> <p>  To explain what happens with the ammonia, if there was a concrete slat or flat surface, when urine and faeces mix, urease, it is like a chemical reaction takes place that basically forms ammonia and ammonia is released into the atmosphere.

When oxygenated air is injected through a network of pipes that are fixed to the floor of the tank, which is driven by a compressor, the oxygenated air being put in basically feeds the aerobic bacteria that are in what let us call a semi-dormant state.

That brings us back to a previous question the Deputy asked, which has not been addressed, regarding an article by a Dutch journalist for a particular publication.  The journalist, Wakker Dier, came to Ireland to do what could be called an undercover expos&eacute; on beef production here.  He visited a number of sheds and found that our beef production is predominantly based on cold slippy concrete slats, as he described them, with little room for each animal, perhaps only up to 2.5 sq. m.  That was quite an embarrassing article for Bord Bia, which was the target of this article due to the green, grass-fed image that we portray around the world.  He decided that image needed to be exposed for what it was.  For 60% of the year our cattle are outside grazing on grass but, in reality, for 40% of the year they are housed indoor because it is not feasible or practical to have cattle out all year round.  Therefore, for 40% of the year animals are kept indoors.  Only 20% of the floors they are on have soft rubber flooring.  There is a great number of cattle on those slats, as that journalist mentioned.  The article was embarrassing for Bord Bia.

The Dutch Government has funding in place whereby technology or solutions that deliver reductions on farms from an emissions perspective are supported by a central fund.<\/p> <p>  On the carbon credits situation, no country is really trading credits on the back of this at present.  It is probably something that will come down the line.  We look to the US where this technology is relatively new.  It is interesting that technology like this is mainly driven by Irish and UK companies.  The same types of systems are not available from local companies in different parts of the world.  For instance, we launched in America last year and were the first to market with this technology.  We have seen very strong interest and growth in the application of the product in the US market.

I am a research assistant in the faculty of engineering and computing at Dublin City University, DCU, researching climate science and low-carbon transition policy.<br\/><br\/>In my current research, I am funded as a carbon budgeting fellow through the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, and have looked at agriculture, forestry and land use as they relate to Ireland&rsquo;s climate action and sustainable development goal objectives.  Previously, in climate change research projects funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and working with Professor Barry McMullin, I have looked at Ireland&rsquo;s potential for negative emissions technologies and what is needed to achieve an effective economy-wide low-carbon transition aligned with our commitment to the Paris Agreement.  I would like to make it clear that my opening statement and my responses today are mine alone and in no way do I speak for DCU or the CCAC.<br\/><br\/>It is important to recognise that greenhouse gas, GHG, and ammonia emissions are accounted by the EPA in standardised national inventory data reporting to the UN and the EU.  Mitigation policies and measures, including technologies and other opportunities, are only useful if they can be verifiably accounted in the national inventory, which requires any new technology or emissions measurement update to pass EPA and international peer review, a process that can take years.  Mitigation action is needed now.<br\/><br\/>Anthropogenic GHG emissions, mostly due to the activities of wealthy nations, have increased global average surface temperature to 1.2&deg;C above the pre-industrial level, resulting in damaging climate change impacts that are most immediately affecting the world&rsquo;s poorest.  The most important GHG is carbon dioxide, primarily from fossil fuel burning.  However, the small remaining global GHG budget to stay within the Paris Agreement&rsquo;s 1.5&deg;C guardrail threshold for dangerous climate change is now being depleted very rapidly.  Therefore, non-CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions, especially methane, and other GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry and land use, must also be reduced as a matter of great urgency; otherwise the carbon budget for even rapid energy transition is unfeasibly small.  <br\/><br\/>Reducing annual methane emissions is especially important because this can actually cut its warming impact to date, unlike carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide, which accumulate, increasing their warming impact even as emissions decrease.  Research at DCU and University College Cork, UCC, indicates that meeting a fair share Irish GHG budget under Paris temperature goals requires a 50% reduction in methane emissions and a 50% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions, in addition to cutting CO<sub>2<\/sub>to net zero before 2050.  Some 93% of Irish emissions of both methane and nitrous oxide arise from agriculture, mostly from cattle through enteric fermentation and manure management.  In <i>per capita<\/i>terms, Ireland has the highest methane and nitrous oxide emissions in the EU.<br\/><br\/>This hearing is focused on opportunities to meet the requirement to reduce GHG and ammonia emissions in Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture sector.  It is, therefore, crucial to understand which previous combinations of policies and measures have reduced emissions and which have failed to do so.  The recent past gives us a good guide.  Agricultural sector GHG emissions peaked in 1998, then fell steadily to 2011, but since 2010 emissions have risen rapidly.  Ongoing EU agricultural policies were in place for the period of falling emissions up to 2011, particularly the milk quota limit on total national dairy production.  Based on EPA inventory data, the GHG and nitrogen-use efficiency of milk and beef production improved up to 2005 but has not improved significantly since then.  Therefore, within Ireland's grass-based system, any increase in milk or beef production now results in more emissions.  As soon as the milk quota started to be released from 2010 onwards, and especially from 2013 onwards, milk production increased rapidly and dairy methane emissions have increased just as quickly, as has nitrogen excretion from dairy cows.  We know that a quota on production is an effective way to limit inventory emissions.  We also now know that in Ireland removing the milk quota on dairy production has been an effective way to increase<i><\/i>emissions.<br\/><br\/>Has this emissions production linkage and quota effectiveness been well understood by experts?  Literature review indicates that experts understand this very well.  Teagasc noted that declining GHG and ammonia emissions since 2000 had been falling since then due to declining ruminant livestock numbers and fertiliser use.  Specifically, looking at the large potential incoherence between Food Harvest 2020 and climate action, in modelling of dairy and suckler cow numbers in 2012, correctly projected that &quot;achievement of the Food Harvest output targets would make the achievement of any reduction in emissions of GHG from Irish agriculture more difficult&quot;.<br\/><br\/>A second question arises.  Compared to the milk quota period up to 2010, have any of the measures proposed or implemented since 2010 been as effective, or even somewhat effective, in curtailing sectoral emissions?  The simple answer is that they have not.  If anything,<i><\/i>by targeting<i><\/i>efficiency, measures have helped to increase emissions because there has been no effective limit on animal agriculture production or nitrogen usage.  Efficiency measures can result in cost savings that can then be reinvested in more production, thereby increasing total national emissions.  That is what has happened.<br\/><br\/>Modelling has consistently shown that a large decrease in beef cattle production would be required to compensate for emissions growth due to increase milk production from higher emitting dairy cows.  However, no policy to ensure achievement of such a compensating reduction without fail has been seriously considered for implementation.  Concerningly, recent media reports indicate that dairy cow numbers are anticipated to rise still further to reach 1.8 million by 2025, exceeding Teagasc roadmap projections and requiring more fertiliser and feed inputs.<br\/><br\/>My research, based on collated data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, and GWP analysis, shows that the methane warming impact of Ireland&rsquo;s cattle and sheep has risen linearly since 1961, at first due to beef and sheep emissions rising up to 2010 and then with much increased dairy production since 2010.  No other EU member state has maintained such a rapid increase in dairy cow numbers since 2010 in the way Ireland has done.  As we have seen in repeated fodder crises and now with the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ireland's agricultural policy has resulted in a sector that lacks resilience and is highly vulnerable to climate and external price shocks.  By contrast, Denmark&rsquo;s intensive agriculture model has higher animal protein exports than Ireland yet has less than half the methane emissions because, since 1985, Danish agriculture has decreased the ruminant fraction of its animal protein production to below 35%, because there are more pigs and poultry, and has decreased its grass-feeding of ruminants to nearly zero, instead feeding animal indoors with domestically grown grain and protein cropping.  I am not endorsing the Danish form of agricultural intensification but the comparison does indicate that by focusing on &ndash; and recently further intensifying &ndash; its grass-based and ruminant-dominated system, Ireland has chosen to persist with and further intensify a very high emissions form of agriculture that is heavily reliant on increased inputs of imported fertiliser and feed.<br\/><br\/>Nitrogen is the key element in the proteins essential for plant, animal and human growth but it is also a primary driver of damaging agricultural pollution by nitrous oxide, ammonia to air and nitrates to water.  The critical importance of limiting nitrogen use is exhaustively addressed in the European nitrogen assessment, including clear messages in its summary for policymakers.  Directing grass and feed inputs, increased by fertiliser use to ruminants, results in more carbohydrates being available for conversion to methane.<br\/><br\/>A milk or meat quota is effective in cutting emissions because it effectively limits nitrogen input usage so a more productive agrifood system responds to a quota with efficiency to produce the same amount from a reduced amount of nutrient input.<\/p><p>Since 1961, Ireland has increased nitrogen fertiliser use by a factor of 12, yet grass protein production has only doubled.  UNFAO data shows that Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood production system has a very low nitrogen use efficiency overall.   The figure is 13%, the worst in Europe and far below the EU average, which was 34% in 2013.  Ireland&rsquo;s nitrogen use efficiency has reduced even further in the past decade due to the conversion from nitrogen-efficient tillage land to low nitrogen-efficient dairy production, which is far more polluting.  <\/p><p> The opportunity to cut agricultural emissions and pollution in Ireland or the EU involves enforcing a policy limit on the total use of nitrogen fertiliser and feed inputs to animal agriculture and biology, via national nitrogen budgeting with subsidiary watershed level allocation to limit local pollution.  Policy could further be aligned with the climate change science, which has repeatedly pointed out that dietary change toward reduced meat and milk production and consumption, particularly in developed countries, is now essential to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goals.  <\/p><p> In summary, urgent mitigation is needed, starting today.  That means cutting emissions now, by limiting high-GHG activities.  As we have seen over the past decade, promises of mitigation tomorrow may well not be delivered.  We should be very cautious, therefore, about misplaced optimism that effective mitigation can be achieved via alternatives, such as carbon farming, fertiliser substitution, biomethane via anaerobic digestion or other technology options.  There is the danger that the focus on technical measures may result in a delay that would distract us from regulating when regulation is required.  We can recognise what works and what does not.  To limit agricultural emissions and pollution, production quotas have been shown to work in Ireland.  System-wide changes away from ruminants and the unbalanced, over-reliance on nitrogen fertiliser and feed imports can cut emissions, while improving the national nitrogen balance.  Following international experts&rsquo; recommendations, we can adopt decision-making based on national and local nitrogen budgeting.

On metrics, we have a system whereby everything is set up towards climate action at a party level.  Counties have to act.  That means that we have climate targets that are based on our emissions under a GWP100 metric system.  That is how things are going to stay.  That is the way we should think about it because that metric even reflects for methane that if emissions are going down, then we will see that.  What is important in Ireland&rsquo;s action as a party to the UNFCCC is its action at that national level.  We can only act on climate in the way that is reflected at the national level through UNFCCC accounting.  If technologies and so forth come along to the extent that they are rolled out over a large area and are accepted, that may have an effect in the national accounting.  However, until then, that is not the way things operate.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, when there were limits or policies that affected the total production, for example, when sheep numbers went down or when there was a dairy quota, farmers were smart.  They worked within that limit.  The efficient ones got more quota or more of the market within that limit.  They were the ones who then produced more milk with less nitrogen.  However, we have seen since taking up that nitrogen limit on the dairy quota that we are just making more milk with more nitrogen.  That is not efficiency.  If we were to make more milk with less nitrogen than we were using in 2010, that would be good, but that is not the situation.  This has been the opposite of climate action, I am afraid.  <\/p> <p>  The Co-Chairman is right about enteric fermentation.  Ruminant enteric fermentation is the dominant emission from agriculture.  That is from some sheep, but it is mostly from cattle.  That has to be addressed in a big way.  Addressing slurry might mean that more nitrogen is used on a pasture and, therefore, that more nitrogen ends up in the water.  We therefore have to be very careful about pollution swapping.  We might take action against one pollutant and potentially get more pollutant going out elsewhere.  Putting a cap on the total amount of nitrogen going into the system would be an effective way to limit all pollution.  However, if we let that cap off and go for a financially-based system, more nitrogen will be used because the nitrogen is cheap.  Then farmers run into trouble if there is a cost increase.  <\/p> <p>  On the point about Denmark, as I said, I am not at all recommending the way Denmark has gone about things.  I am pointing out that Denmark also has animal-based agriculture.  After 1985 in Denmark - and this happened commonly across Europe - there was a huge reduction in fertiliser use and a great increase in fertiliser efficiency.  The same was true in Ireland in crop production.  However, by maintaining a very high fraction of ruminants, especially if they are grass-based, unlike any other country in Europe, lots of nitrogen will be used on grass.  Since 1961, we have approximately doubled the total production of grass but we are using 12 times as much nitrogen.  That is not efficiency.  That is degrading efficiency, even though we are producing more output.  That is the trouble with the overall agrifood system in Ireland, in terms of nitrogen.  Nitrogen is the essential element in protein.  We are far less efficient as an agrifood system than other parts of Europe.  That might not be a problem until problems arise, such as those we are now seeing with price impacts or climate shocks.  We are therefore setting ourselves up to be less resilient, as well as not acting on climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Price"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Price for that.

The targets are absolute.  They are not efficiency or intensity targets.  Absolute emissions in agriculture have gone up and, most importantly, aggregate methane emissions have gone up.<br\/><br\/>Emitting more methane is seriously bad for climate.  What one must do is decrease methane emissions in every sector.  This is not just about agriculture.  In every sector in every country, methane emissions and all other emissions had better go down, especially CO<sub>2<\/sub>from fossil fuels,  Definitely, methane emissions from any source had better go down.  If we are making any argument for carbon leakage, we have to be meeting our climate targets.  In <i>pro rata<\/i>terms, we have done the opposite.<br\/><br\/>What I was pointing out was that until 2011, Ireland was doing very well.  Teagasc reports at the time and Government and departmental reporting were good.  We were on track.  One of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's leads, looking back from 2020 on the Teagasc signpost videos, recently said that there was genuine sustainable intensification but we completely threw that out the window.<br\/><br\/>In 2011, policy was reversed.  We had Food Harvest 2020 which was completely incoherent with climate targets.  Although it was said that it might only increase emissions by 7%, one of the stated ambitions was that if we did lots of work, such as with the Teagasc MAC curve, at the time, we could keep emissions stable.  Even that was not enough.  We were supposed to reduce emissions towards the 2020 targets.  If one wants to make a carbon leakage claim, one has to at least say we are reducing emissions and then we can start talking about carbon leakage.<br\/><br\/>One also has to think about what kinds of food production have high greenhouse gas emissions.  I am afraid ruminant production from grass has very high greenhouse gas emissions intensity, in terms of the amount of protein produced in output, compared to other forms of production.  Denmark has far lower emissions, even though it has an animal-based system, than Ireland.  Its system is far more efficient than Ireland's system.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, in a way we have been fooling ourselves.  We should think that absolute emissions must go down.  If they are not going down, we should be seriously worried.  They have not been going down.  Methane emissions are up by 17%, and overall by 12% on a CO<sub>2<\/sub>basis, since 2010-11.  That is not good.  In global terms, the IPCC modelling looks at reducing emissions very quickly compared to 2010.  We have gone up since 2010.  We cannot make any carbon leakage argument if we cannot stand on our laurels, and our laurels are not there yet.  That is poor.<br\/><br\/>In terms of food security, we are looking at a global food crisis.  We need people to be fed, especially the poorest people around the world.  They will not be fed, I am afraid, on milk and beef.  They need grain and legumes.  That is the kind of balanced diet to get people through what is coming over the next year.  This is very troubling.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the natural response by farmers to this situation, fertiliser prices are going up.  Farmers respond to that situation like a business looking at the optimal economic return.  The optimal return goes down in this situation and they will grow less grain.  That is what will happen because of their response.  We should support tillage and arable farming and support that production.  At the same time, if we care about global food security and really want to support it, we would be very wise to lower limits on animal-derived food production in order to direct our food production and that of the world - and encourage the same thing to happen in Europe - towards producing food at the maximum amount of nourishment per hectare with the lowest emissions too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Price"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I will follow on from Deputy Leddin with reference to the two previous submissions this morning and indeed on a broader scale.

It has developed over the years and decades and it is the only form and source of income in many rural areas.

Unfortunately, we have seen emissions rise.  The idea of having technology is that maybe we could produce more milk with less emissions than we did in 2011.  If one wants to increase the amount of milk production and emissions keep going down, as they were from 1998 to 2011, that is fine.  Knock yourself out.  However, that is not what has happened.  Instead, emissions have gone up, especially emissions of methane, which is a very serious and potent greenhouse gas, and nitrous oxide.  The trouble with technologies that have been talked about, such as urea swapping and protected urea instead of calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, is that if we use more urea, we will get more ammonia emissions.  That will happen in these circumstances unless we take straight urea out of the market, which will not happen.  It is supposed to be out of here by 2023.  There is supposed to be a ban on straight urea use.  That is in the climate action plan.  That is what is supposed to happen with regard to ammonia.  Well, that is not happening either.<\/p> <p>  It is very dangerous to say that we can avail of a certain technology or a certain opportunity if that discussion stops us or distracts us from cutting emissions now.  We should be cutting emissions every year in every sector.  We need to limit the highest GHG activities, because that is what we are about.  We are in a situation where we do not have time to develop more research, more metrics or whatever.  We need to act right now.  We needed to act in 2010 to keep going the way we were.  Sustainability may be about maintaining an activity or changing the activity to make sure we have less emissions.  We have done the reverse, unfortunately, and that is pretty tragic.  That is not the fault of farmers.  Farmers are responding to the policy and market that was set up by all those policy decisions that, for example, led to the removal of the milk quota.<\/p><p>That is the level we must look at.  We certainly should not be looking at farmers as the problem.<\/p><p> Carbon farming is yet another scheme we have had for a long time now, with much hand waving, and it has generally been a disaster around the world.  There are financial operations trying to steer things in the wrong way.  We have had carbon markets failing in guaranteeing credits.  There is no way to really have good measuring, reporting and verification, which is a serious problem.  One must guarantee additionality and that carbon is not being lost.  If public money is to be put towards an investment that really is not guaranteed, we should be very careful about doing it.  We have seen carbon markets really collapsing or being played and gamed in all sorts of ways.  It is particularly the case with small farmers in the US and Australia that when the carbon markets collapse, there is a huge problem especially for those smaller farmers.<\/p><p> With carbon farming, a really good farmer may have great hedgerows in place and grass carbon in the soil, so if the carbon markets only pay for additional carbon savings, it is the people who have done the worst farming who will be paid.  They will have carbon-depleted soils, for example, so why should they be paid?  We must be careful about whom we reward and why.  It is a very poor policy to connect soil quality to climate policy.  It basically confuses and undermines the accuracy of carbon accounting and it also produces really perverse outcomes in soil management.  Good farmers make sure there is more carbon in their soil and guarantee themselves good soil for a resilient future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Price","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Price.

Looking at the modelling on a better system for the EU, the idea is to get to zero inputs of chemical fertiliser but also to have much more of a direct connection between any animals and the crops.  It is more about grain growing, human food and recycling nitrogen back to the land.  We have arrived at this situation because of the way the economics have gone.  Farmers have made good decisions within the system we have but it is an unbalanced system.  If farmers are paid with more certainty to have an unbalanced system, then that is what they will do.  That is because the policy has been set in a certain direction, which is unsustainable.  We are seeing that with the repeated fodder crises and, as the Deputy mentioned, the difficulties for vegetable and tillage farmers in particular.  We should be supporting tillage farmers.

I have found the meeting very interesting and I thank Mr. Price for taking the time to speak to us.  The subject of this meeting is exploring technological opportunities to reduce emissions.  Am I correct in deducing that Mr. Price is not bringing any proposals regarding technological solutions?  Instead, he is looking for two things, the first of which is quotas for beef and dairy production.  How does he envisage quotas would work?  How would they be applied and determined?  Would there be a new market for the quotas themselves, as much as for the food as a commodity?  How would that work in practice?  The second thing Mr. Price is seeking, if I have deduced it properly, is for people to eat fewer meat and dairy products.  Does he see a role for red meat and dairy as part of a healthy balanced diet or would it be satisfactory if people did not eat those products at all?<\/p> <p>  The Danish model is essentially a very intensive factory farming model.

I am afraid the opportunity is, basically, to go back to 2010 and look at where we were then because we were heading in the right direction.  We had promises of technologies that would help us to continue moving in the right direction with Food Harvest and that was continued with Food Wise and Food Vision.  That is the vision we have had and the result has been more emissions, more methane and greater use of nitrogen.  The amount of nitrogen fertiliser being used each year has increased from 300,000 tonnes in 2010-11 to 400,000 tonnes today.  That is an increase of one third.  It is not doing more production with the same or less.  It is just doing more production with more and producing more emissions with more.  That is the vision we have been given.  I am saying we have an opportunity to rethink that vision.  However, I am not going to offer the committee a particular vision.  It is up to the members to decide, as policymakers and so forth.  I am just trying to explain what the science says.<\/p> <p>  I used Denmark as an example because it produces a lot of animal agriculture.  Overall, there is more crop production in Europe generally.  We should think about food security and pollution and so forth by using less nitrogen fertiliser than we were using in 2010.  Right now, according to our targets, we will still be using more fertiliser in 20230 than we were in 2010.  I am suggesting that is a bad vision.  It is unacceptable in view of everything we are talking about and the need to reduce emissions.  The opportunity is to return to where we were.  We have gone along this road and put ourselves in a more difficult position than we needed to be in.  That is resulting in all the things we are talking about.  There is talk in the news today about offering retirement to dairy farmers.  Why did we have to get to this point?  We did not need even more milk production and now we will have to retire dairy farmers.  That does not seem to have been a very sensible way to go about this.<\/p> <p>  On the family farm, what we see all over Europe, and are seeing in Ireland, is fewer family farms.  The vision has been to have more dairy on top of beef farming.  That is what actually happened but we were told by the experts and the science that, in order to keep emissions at the same level, we would have to have far fewer beef cattle, far less beef cattle farming and far fewer small family farms.  What has happened in Europe with milk production is that it has become a big commodity.  All over Europe, there are fewer farms producing the milk.  There is a film on Netflix called \"The Milk System\".  Members can watch that film and see what has happened elsewhere, such as in the USA with carbon credits and so forth.  Small farmers are being taken advantage of and they lose control of their carbon credits.  All these systems have been hugely problematic and that is the history of them.  There has been a collapse in the carbon credit system in Australia as well.  These are technologies and ideas that are not actually achieving what we want them to do and they also endanger clear carbon accounting.  The way we have gone is a threat to the family farm but it is also a threat to carbon accounting.  Having these kinds of technology discussions without saying what we are actually about here is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Price"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Price very much for the presentation.  He is saying that what is happening now is wrong and that it is up to us, as policymakers, to create a new vision.  It seems, however, that if we are to deliver the Paris commitments, the political challenge will be to bring communities on board.  He seems to be saying that we must set a target to cut the herd, but he is not saying that we should set a target to cut oil straight away or set a quota for oil in other sectors.  People know that if a quota for oil was set tomorrow, there would be a lot of vulnerable families that would not be able to heat their homes and there would be a lot of industry that would not be able to continue.  Mr. Price is proposing that farmers cut their herds while rejecting carbon farming, which would reward them for reducing methane, nitrous oxides or other emissions, but he cannot have it both ways if he wants to contribute to a political solution.<\/p> <p>  One way or another, we have a large sector that we need to bring on a journey to a better endpoint.  Mr. Price is offering a very abrupt solution.  As politicians and as member of this committee, we are trying to find a way to meet our Paris commitments while bringing communities with us because we know we cannot deliver without them.  I am struggling to see how Mr. Price can sell his approach to a family farm unit at the moment.  He is telling them to stop doing a whole lot of things, but he is not going to reward them with an income for providing the better environmental services that would come from a carbon farming model.  I know it has challenges and he is right to say that there are measurement and verification issues but surely that has to be the way to provide a pathway so that in ten year's time we will still see prosperous family farms.

It is immensely problematic but from the science side of things, scientists have been talking about this for a long time.  They have been saying that we need to cut emissions of all of the main greenhouse gases in every sector.  The AR5 report from the IPCC in 2014 talks about substantial and sustained emissions reductions.  That was the guidance from science but that has not happened.  The science was saying that if we do not do this, we will face having to implement abrupt solutions.  Politicians are now saying to scientists that we face abrupt solutions and asking us what is our vision.  Our vision was ignored and we now face more abrupt solutions involving higher costs.  We would not be in the situation of having to pay dairy farmers to retire if we had followed that IPCC advice.  Right now, we are in a situation of abrupt solutions because of that journey.<\/p> <p>  Scientists can only say what they say; it is up to politicians and leaders in communities to say what we actually face.  When our negotiators came back from these UN climate change conferences, they should have been on the television explaining what needed to happen.  That communication did not happen, however,.  We need to see a high level of communication of where we are and the urgency of what we are about or what we need to be about if we are going to align our actions with our commitments.  Our commitment is to align our actions with achieving the Paris goals equitably.  That is our commitment, but we have gone in the opposite direction in agriculture.  Even in the area of energy, emissions have stayed the same.  As the Deputy stated, it is about balancing agricultural sector reductions and land-use emissions reductions against reductions in the energy sector, but all of those things have to go down and very quickly.  That is what the CCAC is saying with its carbon budgets.  If one looks at the council's core scenarios, it is saying just what I am saying; it is saying that we have to cut emissions in all sectors, quite seriously, by 2030.<\/p> <p>  The work that Dr. Hannah Daly at UCC has done demonstrates that in the four scenarios, if we only reduce agricultural emissions by the lesser amount, we will have to do much more on the energy side.  As the Deputy says, we have to balance these out.  Methane reduction has a huge impact.  In that context, it would be better to be reducing our methane emissions.  The most recent thing that has happened is the increase in dairy, on top of beef.  Dairy cows are much more emissions intense and the land they are on has been hugely intensified.  That is not a sensible system and that is how we have ended up in this situation, where we have to cut beef cattle and reduce family farms much more in order to allow for that dairy increase.  That is the situation we are in, but scientists have been saying this for a long time.

In that context, is there not a strong argument for paying a premium for methane reduction?

I accept that farmers who have already engaged in very good soil management will not be rewarded and that it will be those whose management heretofore was not good who will be rewarded by some of these incentive schemes.  Surely, however, it is a vision for the sector to suggest that we pay for what we want to reduce.  What we want to reduce is methane emissions, nitrogen emissions and so on.  Why is Mr. Price so opposed to a vision that proposes the creation of a new incentive structure?

The EU has set targets that do not have that sort of structure within them, even though there are those sorts of payment structures in other sectors.<\/p> <p>  I admit that it is a challenge in terms of metrics and verification development to do that, but surely this is a good way of delivering our primary objective, which is to see methane levels go down.

I am trying to report to the committee the evidence as it pertains to the subject of this discussion.<\/p><p> It is misleading to describe methane as a short-lived gas in the sense of climate targets.  It does not matter if it is a short-term gas.  If you maintain it, it will maintain roughly the same temperature contribution, and that can be large.  In Ireland, the temperature contribution of methane is large.  Right now, when it is sustained, it is large even compared to the total emissions from pre-industrial CO2 in Ireland.  The methane contribution is large.  Cutting methane presents a huge mitigation opportunity.  That is what you see in the CCAC&rsquo;s Paris test.  There would be a big hit in terms of a mitigation opportunity from that reduction so maybe, as was said, that says that we as society should pay for that reduction.  I would also point out that we would then pay for what has been a big increase in methane emissions.  We could start paying from when we get back.  However, it seems a bit odd that we have committed to a system.  As I said, it is not the farmers&rsquo; fault.  Policy has been directed to do this.  It has resulted in this big increase in methane emissions.  The public directed all of its energies and supports for doing that and it is now being told that it has to pay for it when it is on the way down again.  That seems to be an odd way go about that policy.  However, as was said, maybe we are in a situation where we have to do that.  I am not advocating for what we have to do.  That is up to politicians, to society and to discussion to work out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032400002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Price","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Price for his strong views and for giving us a different perspective on the issues we are addressing.

I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I feel very strongly about the need to support people with disabilities in their lives and their work.  During my time as Minister, I have sought to make sure that the interests of people with disabilities and carers remain a focus of my Department&rsquo;s priorities.<\/p> <p>  During the pandemic, and notwithstanding the significant pressures on my Department and the Exchequer, I worked to ensure that those on disability and caring payments were supported.  Processing timelines on payments were met, even at a time when my Department was dealing with the unprecedented demands of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  In addition, my Department ensured that those who were on disability and caring payments who lost their employment during the pandemic were able to receive their PUP as well as their primary social welfare payment.  This helped to ensure that their incomes were protected from the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The topic before the committee today is the independent and adequate standard of living and social protection, with a particular focus on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Ireland signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and the Government formally ratified the convention in 2018, with it entering into force on 19 April 2018.  Articles with particular relevance to my Department include Article 28, dealing with adequate standard of living and social protection, and Article 27, dealing with work and employment.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Article 28 and the adequate standard of living and social protection, this year's spending on illness, disability and carers is an estimated &euro;4.9 billion.<\/p><p>This represents 21.1% of my Department&rsquo;s total expenditure for the year.<\/p><p> Since 2015 there has been a significant increase in the number of people supported under these schemes.  The number of people claiming disability allowance has increased by 28% and the cost of the scheme has increased by 41%.  The number of people claiming carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit has increased by 42% and the cost of the schemes has increased by 52%.  Invalidity pension claimant numbers have increased by over 7% and the cost of the scheme has increased by 17%.  Those figures will give members a good idea of the very significant increases in the number of people my Department is supporting under our various disability and carer support payments in recent years.  We are now supporting more people than ever before under schemes like carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance and invalidity pension.<\/p><p> Budget 2022 saw increases to the maximum weekly rate of carer's allowance, carer's benefit, illness benefit, disability allowance, blind pension and invalidity pension by &euro;5, with proportionate increases for people getting a reduced rate.  The fuel allowance and the living-alone allowance were also increased as targeted supports aimed at helping those who are most in need.<\/p><p> Since my appointment as Minister for Social Protection, supporting our carers has been a key priority for me.  Last year, in my first budget in the Department, I increased the carer&rsquo;s support grant to &euro;1,850, which represents the highest-ever rate of payment for that grant.  In this year&rsquo;s budget, I made significant changes to the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test.  The capital-savings disregard for the carer&rsquo;s allowance means assessment is being increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for disability allowance.<\/p><p> For carers who work, I have increased the weekly income disregard from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse or partner.  These are the first changes that have been made to the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test in 14 years.  The changes will take effect in June and they will mean that thousands of carers currently on a reduced rate will move to a higher payment.  In addition, many carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will now be brought into the carer's allowance system for the first time.  I know these changes have been warmly welcomed by the carers' representative groups.  Of course, there is still more work to do for our carers.  I am committed as part of the decisions we make on the pensions commission report that we will provide a pension for our carers.<\/p><p> Regarding supporting work and employment under Article 27 of the UN convention, I increased the earnings disregard for disability allowance and blind pension by &euro;20 from &euro;120 to &euro;140 per week.  Prior to this, the level of the disability allowance disregard had not changed since 2006.  This will support people with disabilities to increase their participation in work and will help to ensure that we make work pay.<\/p><p> People with disabilities who are working will also benefit from an increase in the earnings threshold from &euro;350 to &euro;375 before their income is fully assessed for their disability allowance payment.  People receiving disability allowance will also see an improvement in the general means disregard as it will increase from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60 per week.<\/p><p> I also want to support employers who employ people with disabilities.  That is why as part of budget 2022 I increased the rate of wage subsidy scheme for employers by &euro;1 per hour to &euro;6.30 per hour.  This is the first time the rate has been increased for many years.<\/p><p> Employers employing a person with a disability for 39 hours per week will receive a payment from the State of &euro;12,776 per annum.  This is a significant incentive for employers to offer employment opportunities to people with disabilities.<\/p><p> I understand that the committee is interested in the question of how decisions to grant or refuse disability allowance are taken and is concerned at what is perceived to be a high level of appeals.  Decisions on entitlement to social welfare payments are bound by the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  This legislation provides for a transparent and fair decision-making process with specified criteria that must be met by applicants and an appeals process for those who are not satisfied with a decision.  A number of conditions must be assessed in order to determine a person&rsquo;s entitlement to long-term disability and caring payments.<\/p><p> Primary among these is the person&rsquo;s capacity to work or, in the case of carer payments, a person&rsquo;s requirement for full-time care and attention.  In both cases this assessment is performed by qualified doctors employed by the Department and is based on medical reports submitted by the applicant.  It is important to note that the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors do not question the medical diagnosis presented in the medical reports but use the reports to assess the impact of this diagnosis on a person&rsquo;s capacity to work or their care requirements.  In addition to work capacity or care needs a person must also satisfy either the social insurance contribution requirements or the relevant means test.  In the case of disability allowance and carer's allowance, the person claiming the payment must be habitually resident in the State.<\/p><p> There is some commentary that most decisions get overturned on appeal, which is not correct.  Most decisions are not appealed and the percentage of decisions that are revised or changed on appeal represents about 12% of all decisions by the Department.  The data for 2021 indicate that 28,158 claims for disability allowance were determined, of which 13,289 decisions to award were made.  A total of 5,575 appeals for disability allowance were processed, which is equivalent to about 20% of all claims decided, or 37% of unsuccessful claims.<\/p><p> Of the appeals received, 643 were allowed by my Department&rsquo;s deciding officers following receipt of further evidence with an appeal request.  It is not uncommon for applicants to submit additional information following a negative claim decision.  In such cases even though the information is received as part of an appeal, our deciding officers and medical assessors review those cases to see if the additional information warrants a revised decision.  A total of 2,712 were allowed by appeals officers and 42 appeals were withdrawn.  Putting all of these numbers together, claims awarded by appeals officers constituted just 10% of all decisions made in 2021.<\/p><p> No process is ever perfect but I believe that these data indicate that the overwhelming majority of people who are entitled to disability allowance secure that entitlement at first decision and that the appeals process provides an effective means of redress for people who are not satisfied with the first decision.<\/p><p> I will now outline my priorities for this year.  As set out in the programme for Government, we will use the results of the cost of disability research commissioned by my Department to inform future policy decisions.<\/p><p>This report, produced by Indecon, has recently been received and is now being considered by the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  One of the key findings in this report is that the costs faced by people with disabilities vary considerably depending on the nature of the disability faced by a person.  Similarly, a person&rsquo;s capacity for work varies depending on the nature of the disability.  Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion, my Department has a commitment to develop and consult on a straw man proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to take account of this spectrum of disability and work capacity.  I have asked my officials to ensure the straw man proposal takes on board the findings from the cost of disability research.<\/p><p> As for employment-related supports for people with disabilities, I have already set out some of the improvements made over recent budgets.  In addition, my Department is reviewing the reasonable accommodation grants fund.  Stakeholders will have an opportunity to feed into the review later this month and we look forward to hearing this feedback.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, the wage subsidy scheme paid to employers who employ people with disabilities will also be reviewed this year to improve the uptake of the scheme.  My Department will shortly commence rolling out an early engagement approach with young people aged between 18 and 22 years who are in receipt of disability allowance.  This was a key recommendation in the Make Work Pay report and a commitment in Ireland&rsquo;s recent submission on the UN convention.  The early engagement approach will see the public employment service offer support at the earliest opportunity to assist young jobseekers with disabilities to achieve their employment goals.  Consultation with the sector is ongoing in advance of this approach being rolled out.  It is important to note a key principle agreed with the sector is that the approach is voluntary.<\/p><p> I am fully committed to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The decisions in recent budgets and the priorities for this year show this remains a priority for me and for the Government.  Importantly, I emphasise that I and my Department, together with my Government colleagues, are committed to continuing our long-standing practice of consultation and close engagement with stakeholder and representative groups for carers and people with disabilities.<\/p><p> As a final point, I reiterate to members that the Department of Social Protection is here to help people.  Members saw that during the pandemic in the speed with which supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, were provided to people.  They are seeing it again now with the supports we are putting in place to help Ukrainian citizens arriving into the country.  From my experience both when I was outside the Department as a Deputy and now that I am in the Department as Minister, I have always found the staff in the local social welfare offices to be extremely helpful and courteous.  We cannot always do everything we want to do or solve every problem but we will certainly always try our best.<\/p><p> One of the best examples I can give the committee is Catherine&rsquo;s Law, which I introduced last year.  There was a young girl, Catherine Gallagher, who was going to lose her disability allowance payment because she was taking up a PhD scholarship.  I certainly did not want to see that happen.  It was brought to our attention and I am glad we were able to amend regulations to address it.  I know Catherine is getting on well with her scholarship because she texted me last week.  Just last week I signed regulations to extend those provisions to persons in receipt of the blind pension.  Not every problem can be solved like that, but where there are small injustices in the system and if we are able to fix them, we will always try our best.  I wanted to put that on the record and record my thanks to the staff of the Department of Social Protection in the local offices throughout the country.  As we meet this morning, they are doing an outstanding job in the different Intreo offices to deal with the Ukrainians who are coming into this country.  I was out in Dublin Airport and saw at first hand the work staff are doing there.  It is difficult work and it is emotional.  They are going beyond the call of duty, as they always have done, to help people at a time of need.<\/p><p> I thank members for their time.  I am happy to hear their contributions and answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#A00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much.

I thank the Minister very much.  Nobody could doubt her absolute passion for her role and the commitment and drive she has, which she has displayed in this role and previous ministerial roles.  She brings them to this role in particular.  I am very grateful she and her Department are so open to us when we bring instances and discuss situations with her.  I appreciate that very much and it is not just because we are party colleagues.  Across the Houses, people find her Department incredibly accessible with respect to issues and assistance, where they are required.  We are in an unprecedented time when we have people coming into the country fleeing war, which is horrific.  I congratulate the Minister on the work done in the past couple of weeks.  She was at the forefront and her Department was one of the first to ensure supports.<\/p> <p>  We have had harrowing meetings at this committee, and none more so than when we had women with disabilities come in and talk about their experiences.  We recognise persons with disabilities are much more likely to be caught in poverty and that they have a lower likelihood of accessing the workplace.  As a country, our statistics on the latter are appallingly low.  We have also heard of the dependence people with disabilities, especially women with disabilities, have at times, including having to stay in relationships for financial reasons, even where those relationships are abusive.  We have heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, about housing and accessibility in those terms and I am confident we are moving in the right direction.  However, it is very difficult for those who are caught in the financial implications of disability and the lack of opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss the payment rate of the disability allowance itself.  People are paid &euro;208 per week.  Recently, we saw in the report commissioned by her predecessor at the Department that the cost of disability is &euro;226 per week.  Thus, the disability allowance does not even meet the cost of disability and it is also well below the minimum wage.  We have people with acknowledged disabilities who cannot, in some instances, get out to work, yet they do not even obtain the minimum wage from the State.  I would value hearing from the Minister about that.  That, in and of itself, is one aspect.<\/p> <p>  There is the means-testing element.  We have heard just how difficult that is.  We had wonderful contributors to this committee, including women who have opportunities in the arts.  We had one contributor who sang her contribution.  She was a powerful and very talented woman.  However, they talked about being afraid to take commissions because of the means-testing element and affecting their disability allowance.  As I said, in some instances this element obliges people to stay in abusive relationships.  There is also the fact that for certain allowances someone with a disability that is very clearly a lifelong one must prove that disability annually.  That is demeaning because disabilities do not get fixed.  There is a medical model somewhere at the back of that means testing that is objectionable to people who must comply and whose lives are ruled by it.<\/p><p>I implore us to review that and to free up the lives of both women, in particular, and men with disabilities who find that very difficult.  They are disincentivised to take work because of the implications of the means test and the requirement to reapply every year.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for her very detailed contribution regarding the applications and appeals.  Figures have previously been presented to the committee that suggest 63.6% of refusals are overturned on appeal.  Is there anything we can do to make that better?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#C00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":673,"content":"<p>The Senator covered a number of issues relating to the costs of disability.  The Indecon report on that subject shows there are other factors too that we need to consider in the context of how we support people with disabilities.  It is not just the social welfare payment that we need to count; there are other issues and there are other areas where supports are available.  Some areas where we may need to increase supports include housing, equipment, aids and appliances, mobility, transport, communications, medicines, care and assisted services and additional living expenses.  They are the issues being examined.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Senator was referring to the costs of disability <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the gap in respect of the payment, but we must take into consideration all the other supports that are provided in addition.  In this year&rsquo;s budget, as she will be aware, I made some specific changes regarding the disability allowance and the wage subsidy scheme, such as the &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rate of the disability allowance, with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate and an increase of &euro;25 in the earnings threshold above which means are fully assessed in order that persons can earn up to &euro;375 per week before they will lose all their entitlements from the disability allowance and the blind pension.  There was also an increase in the general weekly means disregard entry point for the disability allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60, a considerable increase.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5 per week for disability allowance recipients who have no means.  As for the wage subsidy scheme based subsidy paid to employers that employ people with a disability, there was an increase from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour, effective since January.<\/p><p>Expenditure on the illness, disability and the carer's payment is estimated to amount to &euro;4.9 billion in 2022, representing 21.1% of the total departmental expenditure.  It accounts for approximately 27.9% of gross Vote expenditure and 13.6% of total Social Insurance Fund expenditure.  A Christmas bonus was paid to certain long-term social welfare recipients in 2021, including all recipients of the carer's payment, the disability allowance, the blind pension, the invalidity pension and the domiciliary care allowance, at a cost of &euro;74 million.  Moreover, the number of people with disabilities whom we pay, and the sums we pay them, increases every year, which shows the Government is committed to provide supports for people with disabilities.  The Senator spoke about the retention of the free travel pass for five years for people with a long-term disability who are in receipt of the disability allowance to allow them to take up employment.  This too is intended to bridge the gap between the costs of disability and the supports we are providing.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Health has introduced a process that enables persons in receipt of the disability allowance payment to have a greater earnings capacity while retaining their medical card.  Indeed, the medical card earnings disregard increased from &euro;120 to &euro;427 per week.  These are just some of the other measures being taken outside of my Department to support people with disabilities.  What is most important is that they are able to get back into work because that in itself will improve their income and prospects and that is what I am especially focused on.  We do that through a number of programmes, such as the employability programme, jobs clubs or the ability programme.  There are many programmes designed to help people with disabilities, particularly young people, to transition into work.  We are putting all these structures in place to encourage them to do that.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned difficulties faced by women in particular.  We introduced the rent supplement for victims of domestic violence, for which there is no means test for the first three months given that, as we all know, it is a very difficult decision for a woman to leave the family home.  Of course, it is not always a woman but in the majority of cases it is.  We wanted to help them by not requiring them to go through a means test to get the rent supplement to help them move out in what can often be very difficult circumstances.  They will then have the option of applying for the housing assistance payment, HAP, which is a long-term support, after six months.  That has been very positively received.  A total of 200 women are on the scheme already, that is, 200 women who were enabled to leave their homes, in what must have been very difficult circumstances, and find alternative accommodation.<\/p><p>I hope I have covered all the questions the Senator asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#D00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":674,"content":"<p>It was a comprehensive response but I have one further question.

People in receipt of the invalidity pension are transferred to the contributory State pension when they reach the pensionable age.<\/p> <p>  I am aware many persons with a long-term illness or disability find the name derogatory and inappropriate.  Although some may associate the term \"pension\" with older age, it is commonly associated with long-term payments throughout the European Union for the contingencies of invalidity or old age.  The use of the term \"invalidity\" reflects the terminology used in the relevant EU directive.  The rules for the co-ordination of invalidity benefits in the EU are provided in EC Regulation No. 883 of 2004 and invalidity benefits are a branch of social security co-ordinated under this regulation.  The term \"invalidity pension\", therefore, is an instantly recognised term in respect of its purpose and what it covers in both an EU and domestic context.  Invalidity benefits and pensions are generally provided where an insured person suffers incapacity for work leading to permanent invalidity.  It is difficult to find a term that will continue to be acceptable to everyone over the passage of time.

Many people are also fearful of losing their medical cards.  Will the Minister look at that again.  Will she talk to the people who are self-employed, who want to establish their own businesses, who are entrepreneurs and who do not feel the supports are there?  The back-to-work schemes are not tailored to the person; they are set at a number of years rather than around what the person needs and how long he or she needs to get back into work.  Artists and musicians work is often on a commission basis.  These people afraid to take up commissions because they will lose their core payment of the blind pension or the disability payment.  Could that be structured differently in order that it might be looked at on a yearly basis instead of a weekly or monthly basis?<\/p> <p>  The Minister also talked about the number of claims for disability allowance that were refused.  There were more than 28,000 claims made in 2021 and only 13,000 of them were awarded.  I would be concerned about that.  Many of them are not appealed.  That is because people may not know how to lodge appeals.  We need to ensure that the mechanism for making the application in the first place is easy to read and is structured, or that the supports are put in place for disabled people to make applications and that they are aware that they can appeal it and that they know how to do that.  Another big issue we come across is the lack of knowledge regarding entitlements and how to apply in respect of the different schemes or supports that are there.<\/p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the means-tested payment and the effect it has on disabled women.  Disabled women came before us and stated that the prevalence of domestic violence against disabled women is higher than against women generally.  Often, the reason they do not leave is the lack of independence because they are means tested against their partner's income and therefore do not have a payment of their own.  Could this be revised in order that if a person is receiving a disability payment or blind pension that the spouse's income could be looked at to be taxed at a higher rate.  Could it be done in such a way that the disabled person would still be able to claim their own payment and rely on that?  When people get to pensionable age, many women want their own money and sometimes they are not allowed to have their it because their partners are still working and earning, and their pensions are means tested against that.<\/p> <p>  The final point I want to make relates to the time it takes to process the carer's allowance.  It takes upward of four months.  That is an inordinate length of time.  Could that be looked at as well in order to make matters easier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#E00100","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":678,"content":"<p>When carer&rsquo;s allowance is being assessed and the application comes in, the figures I have indicate that it takes an average of five weeks.  Those figures have come down considerably over the past number of years.  In 2021, applications were turned around on an average of five weeks.  I will go through the figures later on the appeals but the fact is that many of the applications fail in the first instance because the medical evidence is not correct.  The Deputy knows this from dealing with her constituents, the same as I do, that the medical evidence might not always be complete but the form goes in.  Then when further medical evidence is provided the application is often successful.  We have also simplified the form for applying for disability allowance.  If people are unsure about appeals, the Citizens Information Board is there to give people advice on what their entitlements are.  It provides an excellent service and is available and has a very good website.  We use it a great deal in our constituency office as no doubt the Deputy does also.  We often find that people come into our constituency offices to see why their application was not successful.  In the majority of cases where applications are unsuccessful, it is because the medical information has not been provided.  That is obviously needed to make the assessment.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that we have done a great deal of work to support people with disabilities.  There is always more to be done, and that is what we continue to focus on.  The effort to help people with disabilities is required across a number of Departments, whether it is in the context of housing, transport, education, health or whatever.  I have outlined what I have done in the Department of Social Protection.  We have done a great deal in a very short period.  I have reformed the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test by significantly increasing the amount of savings and weekly earnings a carer can have.  I am the first Minister in 14 years to do anything on the carer&rsquo;s means test.  I have increased the rate of the wage subsidy scheme in the budget.  That is a very important support to encourage employers to hire people with disabilities.  I do not think the rate has been touched for more than a decade.<\/p> <p>  I have also made changes to the income disregards for disability allowance in the budget.  Last year, when there were doubts over whether the local ability providers would continue to be funded because the European funding had run out, I made sure we found the funding to keep that programme going.  I met with Des Henry and the ability providers throughout the country.  Indeed all the members know the great work that they do.  During the pandemic we made sure that people on carer&rsquo;s or disability payments who lost their part-time work, got the pandemic unemployment payment.  That meant they were able to get two social welfare payments to help them.  When a clear injustice was brought to my attention regarding PhD students on disability allowance as I mentioned earlier, I acted in a matter of days and introduced Catherine&rsquo;s law.  As I said, we have now extended that to those in receipt of the blind pension.<\/p> <p>  As stated earlier, the number of people receiving payments such as disability allowance, carer's allowance and invalidity has increased by approximately 40% since 2015.  This means that my Department is now helping and supporting more people through those payments than ever before.  The total spending on our various disability supports this year will be close to &euro;5 billion.  I would, of course, like to do more.<\/p><p>Every Minister would like to do more but I must work within the realities of government and finite resources.  We cannot do everything we want to do at once.  I assure members that supporting people with disabilities and carers will be a priority for me once again in this year's budget.  I am absolutely committed to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and my colleagues across the Government to improve supports for people with disabilities.  A lot of work is being done.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked me what are we doing to tackle poverty among people with disabilities.  The 2020 at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate for people with disabilities is 35.9%, which is a decrease from the 2019 rate of 37.5%.  This year's budget package for people with disabilities specifically included measures that will help to address poverty among people with disabilities.  These included a &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rate of disability allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, carer's benefit, illness benefit and invalidity pension, with proportionate increases for people getting a reduced rate; an increase in the rates\u00a0for a qualified child under and over 12 years of age; an increase in the living alone allowance from &euro;20 to &euro;22 a week, thus benefiting people in receipt of the disability allowance or invalidity pension and who live alone; and an increase in the fuel allowance to &euro;33 per week, benefiting people in receipt of the disability allowance or invalidity pension who qualify for the payment.  For those people who are working or in a position to take up work, the measures include an increase of &euro;25 per week in the upper earnings disregard for the disability allowance and the blind pension, from &euro;350 to &euro;375; an increase in the general weekly means disregard for the disability allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60 per week, resulting in an increase of up to &euro;5.10 per week where a person on disability has means; an extension of access to support grants for jobseekers with disabilities through employability contractors; and an increase in the rate of the wage subsidy scheme available for private sector employers by one hour to &euro;6.30 per hour, which is a significant increase equivalent to 60% of the national minimum wage.  We have, therefore, provided significant supports to help people with disabilities to get work and we incentivise employers to take on people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the scheme for artists.  As she knows, the arts and culture task force recommended the introduction of a pilot basic income scheme for artists.  This commitment was reflected in the national economy recovery plan.  Budget 2022 included an announcement of &euro;25 million for a pilot basic income guarantee scheme for artists.  My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, has lead responsibility for the initiative.  The Minister and her Department are progressing the matter.  Any issues regarding the interaction between the new pilot payment and existing payments by my Department, such as the disability allowance, will be addressed in due course.<\/p><p> We have done considerable work to improve the situation for people who provide care and those who are on disability payments.  More can always be done and we will keep all these matters under review.<\/p><p> On claims, significant improvements in new claim decision-making have been achieved over recent years for the carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  This has been maintained by my Department throughout the period of the pandemic.  The average time to award a carer's allowance in 2021 is four weeks compared with seven weeks in 2020 and 14 weeks in 2019.  The average time to award carer's benefit in 2021 is four weeks compared with five weeks in 2020 and 12 weeks in 2019.  Those figures have improved, especially considering the huge volume of work processed by the staff in the Department of Social Protection during 2020 and 2021.  Many millions of transactions were processed to ensure people received the pandemic unemployment payment.  To achieve that level of output and make these improvements in timeframes was quite something given the circumstances in which staff had to work.<\/p><p> I believe I have covered most of the issues raised by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#E00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to the roadmap for social inclusion and how it commits to reduce the at risk of poverty and social exclusion rate for people with disabilities.

I welcome everything that is being done to support people with disabilities.  As the Minister said, a lot more needs to be done.

Significant work is taking place and I will work closely with my Minister of State in that respect.<\/p> <p>  Indecon prepared a comprehensive report.  A basic standard income for all people with a disability is unlikely to properly address the costs incurred by those most severely limited by their disability.  We all recognise that resources are finite but we want to ensure that they are targeted at the people who need them most.  On the one hand, we have people who have severe and profound disabilities and, on the other hand, we have people who have much less disability.  We need to target supports at people who are profoundly disabled and need the most support.  The one-size-fits-all approach is not fit for purpose.  That has been made very clear in the report.  The committee will consider many of these issues and produce recommendations following consideration of the Indecon report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#F00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister is here because it is abundantly clear that there is a huge disconnect between what the Department is doing and what it needs to do for people with disabilities to enable them to realise their rights.<\/p> <p>  Disability, employment and social protection are very complex areas and their interactions can either empower or disadvantage people.  The approach taken by this Government and previous Governments has not worked.  We have one of the highest rates of poverty and social exclusion in the EU for people with disabilities, at 38.1%, while, at the same time, we have the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities, at 32.3%.  The system needs flexibility to help people work and receive State payments instead of sharp cliff edges, which can make those working less well-off.  Those who have no choice other than the carer's allowance and disability allowance need a guaranteed standard of living.  We do not have that.  The disability allowance is currently &euro;208.  This compares with the pandemic unemployment payment benchmark of &euro;350 for the cost of living.  This disparity is not an exercise in comparing figures.  It is the lived reality of many disabled people and carers in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We know there is a significant added cost to having a disability.  The Minister and her Department know that.  In fact, everybody knows that, yet the disability allowance is &euro;208 per week.  Underlying all of this is the absence of a rights-based approach and a medicalised model of disability.  There is little consideration given to the individual and insufficient flexibility to enable independent living.<\/p> <p>  I was left speechless when the Minister spoke about the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2018 because we were the last country to do so and we did it ten years too late.  In addition, we still have not ratified the optional protocol of the UN convention.  As such, it is not something to reel off almost as a boast.<\/p> <p>  Of major concern to this committee is the fact that more applications for the disability allowance are refused than accepted initially but then, on appeal, almost two thirds are granted.  Again, the Minister reeled off those figures as if the Department should be proud of them.<\/p><p>That demonstrates a very obviously overly restrictive approach to the application process.  In response to Deputy Tully it was said that consistently the medical information part was the problem.  What is the Department doing to make the form easier for people to fill out?  It is unacceptable that more than half of the applications are refused, and then, on appeal, almost two thirds are granted.  That does not make any sense.  How is the Department not looking at this and asking, \"How do we make sure this does not happen anymore?\", instead of looking at it and saying, \"Well, people are not filling out their medical information correctly\"?  What is the Department doing to address that situation?<\/p><p> There is also a significant issue with the disability allowance around the lack of flexibility.  Last week, Disabled Women Ireland talked about how many women who are disabled in part-time or temporary employment are fearful that additional work, such as covering a colleague's sick leave or in the case of artists accepting a commission, for example, results in them crossing restrictive thresholds that result in withdrawal of their supports.  This is the opposite of a rights-based approach.  We need a system that can holistically consider individuals and have flexibility to allow them to temporarily increase their income without affecting their payments.  As we said, we are aware that there is an added cost to having a disability and, therefore, the &euro;208 payment is really less than the bare minimum.  Any additional work should not affect that very small and inadequate payment.  On that, what is the Minister's view on raising the threshold of earnings disregard for the disability allowance by &euro;20?<\/p><p> The social model of disability understands that society creates the disability.  Our systems and our buildings are the barriers.  The density and complexity of the social protection system is disabling people.  With digital literacy issues, access to IT equipment means that online platforms can be accessible, while, at the same time, paper applications can be difficult to access.  All social protection forms should be available in plain English and be consistent.  For example, the enhanced illness benefit form online is much simpler than the paper version.  I am sure I am not the only person who has encountered this.  Forms such as those for illness benefit and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance are not available for download.  These are obvious barriers, which the Minister and the Department are aware of, but there are also very easy solutions.  Will she commit to all forms being available in plain English and online?<\/p><p> The pandemic highlighted issues such as digital poverty.  Will she seek to update the forms for the household benefits package and the telephone support loans to include support for Internet services, broadband, and hardware such as laptops and tablets, as soon as possible?<\/p><p> Inclusion Ireland has suggested the recruitment of job coaches for Intreo offices to provide on-the-job support to enable those with high support needs to obtain and maintain employment.  Their assessment is that such supports are not currently in place.  What is the Minister's view on such an approach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#F00400","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her comments but I do not agree with most of them.  She has selectively picked out everything she could and tried to point out that it is wrong.  I am very proud of what I have done in this Department since I came here just one and a half years ago.  In our first budget for 2021, I increased the carer's support grand to the highest level ever of &euro;1,850.  That was paid in June to all carers.  This year, in 2022, which is the second budget that I have headed up in the Department, I have reformed the carer's allowance means test in respect of the capital disregard.  The disregard went from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  This is the first time it had been changed in years.  The weekly income went up to &euro;350 per week up for a single person, and &euro;750 per week for a couple.  That kicks in during June.  This means that a person could have &euro;50,000 in the bank, each person could be earning &euro;350 per week and they would still get the carer's allowance of up to &euro;224 per week.  When we make our decision on the pensions commission report, it is a priority for me to provide a pension for carers.  That is just one issue.<\/p> <p>  On the medical information, it is the doctor who fills that in.  We are not asking the applicant to fill it.  We have found that the main reason an application is turned down is the medical information has not been provided.  Then, most people go back to the doctor, get clarification, and then it is processed again.  I have seen this in my constituency office and I am sure the Deputy has seen it in hers too.  When the correct medical information goes in, the application can be approved. A decision cannot be made on an application, however, if one does not have the information.  Again, it the medic who completes that, not the applicant.  We have also simplified the application form to make it easier for people to complete.<\/p> <p>  We are not in the business of putting barriers in front of people accessing supports.  Just to be clear, we are here to help people and we have done that through the pandemic with almost &euro;9 billion worth of supports.  For the Deputy to say that we are trying to put obstacles in the way of people getting their payments, their entitlements or their supports is absolutely wrong and I can stand over that as I sit here and talk about staff in social protection.  They are there to help.  I have met them.  I was in Sligo where there are more than 600 staff employed.  I met with the staff and each one of them is there to help people.  That is what they do and that is what we are here to do also to make sure that people get the support they need, when they need it, especially people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I will give the Deputy some information on the appeals that she mentioned.  There were 28,158 decisions made.  Of those,13,289 were granted with 10,500 granted on the first attempt and processed straight away.  There were 5,575 appeals out of the 28,000, and 2,712 of those were allowed.  Some people do not qualify for the disability allowance, for whatever reason.  The terms and conditions are clearly set out.  We have changed some of the conditions, and we will continue to look at them to see what we can do.  We must, however, put things into perspective here.  We have limited resources.  We continue to review all of these issues coming up to the budget and I will continue to do that.  I will also continue, with my officials, to engage with the disability sector, which I have done in the past, and I will continue to do so in the future.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the &euro;208 payment.  It is the basic payment but she is not including the household benefits.  Many of them also get the fuel allowance, others get the free travel, and of course there is the medical card.  There are a number of other supports out there, but we want to do more and we will continue to do more.<\/p> <p>  I accept the EUROSTAT estimates.  We have targets to reduce this in the roadmap for social inclusion and we will continue to work on all of those issues, and do everything we can to support people with disabilities.  The most important thing I want is to try to help people who can go back to work to do so.  This empowers them and gives them an income.  It gives people an independence, which is what we want to provide.  There is huge support available for employers who take on people with disabilities.  I want to highlight this more.  Perhaps this committee could also use the Deputy's good offices to tell people what is available, help them take up those supports, and encourage them to work through the EmployAbility Service.  I have met with people who work in that service and the EmployAbility Service sometimes provides that connection between the employer and the employee.  I heard of a particular case where an employee could not going to work on a Friday because he had to attend an addiction service.  He did not know how he was going to tell his employer, and he was not going to go back to work because of that.  He was able to go to somebody within the EmployAbility Service who was able to have that conversation and sort out that problem.  Every Friday morning thereafter he got whatever number of hours he needed to attend the addiction service.  These are the things we need to do.  We need to work together to alleviate some of these problems, to help people and to empower them to get back to work.<\/p> <p>  I believe I have addressed most of the Deputy's issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#G00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>If I could come back very briefly Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#G00300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#G00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I wish to be clear to the Minister that obviously I am not putting any blame on the staff in offices and I am not putting any blame on doctors filling out the forms; I am just highlighting that the system is not working.

If it is an issue of doctors filling out the forms, what needs to be done to make that more accessible for people?  How is it that so many of these applications are refused and then granted?  The Minister spoke about the benefits being available to people but from the report we know that the added cost of having a disability is &euro;9,000 to &euro;12,000 annually.  That is obviously a bare minimum and it very much depends on the disability and on other circumstances.  While there is a fuel allowance and other different supports, they are just not enough.

This is one of the biggest issues I, like all Deputies and Senators, face in my clinics.  A response to a parliamentary question I tabled states that at present there are more than 400 family carers who are over 80 years of age.  I have concerns about that because I do not know if it is sustainable.  I understand the Minister's commitment.  I have worked with many people on this.  I will outline the way I see the system in general, having dealt with the people I deal with in my offices.  I refer to people with a disability or elderly people in hospital settings.  As the Minister will know, it is very hard to get respite care and so on.  When they come home, I tell the family member caring for the person, \"You may apply for a carer's payment but you will have to do what you do every day.\"  That is fine.  I sit down and go through everything with them.  Most people do it themselves.  They are more than capable of doing so.  I see a lot of refusals, however.  I urge those people to resubmit their applications because they are doing the work of caring for that person with a disability.  That needs to be addressed.  I feel that the system is broken in general.  This is not within just the Minister's remit.  I am aware of the funding she has put in and I welcome it.  I brought this up with her the other day.<\/p> <p>  I will outline to the Minister one issue, however.  I work with people with disabilities on housing adaptation grants.  I find they are so costly now that the people who want them cannot afford them.  Is there any way people claiming carer's payments or people with disabilities could get extra help with those grants?  I know one lady who badly needs a bathroom adaptation grant but who cannot make up the difference.  I find that that is becoming a huge issue in society.  People are no longer getting the grants.  A lot of funding has been given to local authorities in the past two years.  There should be some lenience in respect of the grants, particularly for people with disabilities or people who are elderly and who need them.  They are means-tested and must pay a certain amount.  All the Departments need to look at that.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything we can do to help carers?  Is there any way we could look at widening the list of people with long-term illnesses, for example, who are eligible?  Are there any grants in that regard?  Can we look at free medication?  One of the biggest issues I have - it constantly comes into my office - is VAT on incontinence products.  A significant number of people have to buy them but cannot afford them.  A significant number of people ring me telling me they simply cannot afford those products.  We need to address these things.  That seems to be where we are falling down.  It is the little things that could make the difference.<\/p> <p>  My sister works seven days a week as a carer and loves it.  If she were in a full-time job, she would be on three times the money she is on, but she loves her job.  She gets that from my mother.  People are very appreciative of what they get, but the reality is that carer's benefit and carer's allowance are there to keep people in their homes in order that they are not in respite or hospital settings that will not be able to cater for them, nursing homes or other such settings.  Overall, there seems to be a broken system that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In 2021 I tabled a parliamentary question about carer's allowance.  The Minister replied that, in 2021, the number of applications received was 312, the number of applications cleared was 374 and the number of applications refused was 150.  I tabled a similar question previous to that one.  I do not know whether half of them are appeals.  I do not know what happened in the system.  I deal with the carer's allowance regularly.  I can only say that the staff on the other line are absolutely put to the pin of their collar with the work they do.  They have always been most kind and gracious on the phone.  Truthfully, though, the biggest issue is that they keep requesting further information, further information and further information.  It might not be a doctor's letter.  It could be that a signature was wrong and that the applicant might have to send it back such that the application is in the system for weeks and weeks.  A date of birth could be left out.  It could be the personal public service, PPS, number.  There might be one digit wrong.  Is there any way we could consider phone calls telling people what is wrong and asking them to fill out and send in the required documentation?  Instead, the whole application comes back and has to be redone.  Payments are made from the time of application.  Appeals may be made within 21 days.  You get your full money back once you get your carer's allowance.  I mean that.  They are very good with that.  The social welfare team in my area, Carlow, is excellent if people are waiting on payments or if there are any disability payments to be made.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at the bigger picture.  I know that the Minister is dedicated to that.  It seems that people with disabilities are living longer, which is great, but I do not know if the system is catering for that at present.  Again, I am aware of the hard work the Minister is doing.  She might come back to me with the answers to some of those questions.  I apologise for having been late.  I do not know if any of those questions have been asked already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#H00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>The Department provides carer's allowance, which is a basic income.  We do not pay people for the job they do because we could not do that.  The purpose of this social protection payment is to give people a basic income for the work they do while they are off other work.  There is carer's benefit and carer's allowance.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor went into a number of issues, including free medication and the costs incurred in caring for somebody.  Those are wider issues that fall under the Department of Health's remit.  The Minister for Health is committed to establishing a commission to examine care and supports in the context of older people, in accordance with the programme for Government.  I know, Deputy Murnane O'Connor knows and the other Deputies here all know that there are carers who spend a huge amount of their time caring.  We really could not pay them for the work they do.  The role of the Department of Social Protection is to provide people with a basic income.  This discussion has been knocking around for a long time.  I suggested to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development to sit down and to liaise with the disability committee to look at this conundrum of how to pay carers for the work they do.  Again, some carers have a huge amount of work to do and, as we well know, there are carers whose task is a lot lighter.<\/p><p>It is like the cost of disability report and we must target those who are most severely affected, whether it is through disability or the amount of work they are doing as a carer.  It is a discussion we must have and I have said it before.  I certainly welcome any moves the committees might make in looking at this in the round in order to find a solution.  I know people have said money from the fair deal scheme could be paid to somebody in the home instead of a nursing home and such people may be able to care for longer.  There is a broader issue across government in that respect.<\/p><p> We are reviewing the carer's form and consulting different groups and stakeholders, particularly Family Carers Ireland.  We have reduced the length of time it takes to process the application from 12 weeks to an average of four weeks.

There were particular efforts with the PUP to steer people through that really difficult time.  I also thank the Minister for her really encouraging contribution today.  She is clearly really passionate and committed to delivering change for people with disabilities.  Unfortunately, we regularly hear from witnesses before this committee who share with us the fact that they feel they need better advocacy.  If they are tuned in today, they would be really pleased to hear all that the Minister does to advocate for them at a Cabinet level.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's announcements on budgetary changes that will enable more carers to access financial support and increase social welfare payments for benefits such as disability benefit.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to finding a pathway to providing pensions for carers because that is really important.  It was really interesting to hear the Minister speak about the potential restructuring of long-term disability payments to take into consideration varying costs and capability for work that people with a disability face as challenges.<\/p> <p>  It is fantastic that the Minister is encouraging those who can work to do so and she is incentivising companies to take on people in such a position.  When I worked in a previous role, before I was a Deputy, my company had a great diversity and inclusion programme where we hired people from the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities.  It was a real success both for the employees and their families, and it was also a success for my company.  I saw first-hand exactly what the Minister spoke about today when she described how her Department enables people to be active participants in the workforce.<\/p> <p>  On that point, there is a workplace equipment adaptation grant available from the Department for people working in the private sector but it is not available for people working in the public sector.  It is a discrepancy that was raised before this committee a couple of weeks ago.  To be honest, Departments and the Civil Service should be leading by example when it comes to not just hiring people with disabilities but enabling them to do their jobs and setting them up for success by giving them the equipment they need access to.  I would like to hear whether this is something the Minister will consider.<\/p> <p>  I have three other questions.  The first relates to the changes that will come into effect from June relating to the carer's allowance.  How many people are likely to come into the net with the means test threshold reducing and how many people who are currently receiving part-payment may move to a higher rate?  People on a disablement benefit are currently automatically excluded from receiving the fuel allowance.  Will the Minister consider reviewing this matter further?  Finally, the practice whereby various Departments ask people with disabilities time and again to confirm they still have a disability has been raised repeatedly in this committee.  Will the Department look at that in the context of the restructuring of the long-term disability payments being considered on the basis of the Indecon report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#J00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I am absolutely committed to helping people with a disability to get back into work.  An employer employing a person with a disability for 39 hours per week will receive a payment from the State of &euro;12,776 per annum.  This is a significant incentive for employers to offer employment opportunities to people with disabilities.  It had been my intention to do a jobs roadshow to network employers and people looking for work while trying to promote this process.  It can be a win-win scenario for employers and people with disabilities if they can be brought into the workplace.  It is so important as it takes people out of poverty and gives them dignity.  That is what we want to do.  Most important, we want to empower them to get out there and meet people socially through work, etc.  There is a good deal of support for that process.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why people in the public sector do not get a grant to adapt a workplace that is available to those in the private sector.  We expect the public sector to show leadership in this and we cannot really have one arm of the State subsidising another.  One would expect Departments and public bodies to show leadership in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about people in receipt of the disablement benefit and the fuel allowance.  I take it that the point has been raised with me before but I will revert to the Deputy about it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many carers will benefit from the budgetary changes.  The number is approximately 8,000.  Those people will need to revise their claim in the coming weeks, given the expanded criteria within which they can apply for the payment.  I encourage anybody who was turned down because the application was outside the limits to submit another application.  We hope people will do that.<\/p> <p>  I have received a note on the disablement benefit.  The disablement benefit depends on the degree of the person's disablement, which is medically assessed.  If the person's disability is assessed at under 20%, that person will receive disablement benefit in a lump sum, with the amount depending on the degree of disability and how long it is expected to last.  The maximum is &euro;16,720.  If the person's disability is assessed at above 20%, the payment is between a minimum of &euro;47.80 per week and a maximum of &euro;239 per week, depending on the degree of disability.  People on disablement benefit might also qualify for incapacity supplement, constant attendance allowance or medical care.  They do not get the fuel allowance currently but we keep all these matters under review.  This has been raised with me before and there are not that many people on disablement benefit when we consider the supports out there for social welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#J00400","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for addressing all the questions.

Of those who responded, 440 disclosed disabilities.  This constitutes 6.5% of the overall Department staff complement as of 31 December 2021.

Recruitment for the Department is conducted by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and it is committed to ensuring that employment competitions are accessible to individuals requiring adaptations of competitions processes and the applicants are facilitated in that regard.  The Department has engaged with PAS to discuss recruitment overall and to advise on a public appointments strategy to enhance equal opportunities in the recruitment process.

Someone came to me about the starting the process of trying to look for a job, and a person with a visual impairment, for example, would encounter unseen barriers.  That is something we must keep under constant review to ensure we are getting it right.  Another area that might prove to be a constant barrier for people is the availability of personal assistance hours.  Those often come through a different Department than the Minister's, but a barrier for people might be the conflation of personal assistance hours for daily living with those for employment.  The Economic and Social Research Institute flagged this issue in 2020.  It puts people in the position where they must make a choice between their allocation of personal assistance hours for daily living and those for employment.

They are clearly well up on the schemes.  The Minister and her officials are very much on top of all these figures.  A great deal of positive work is being done by the Department.  From my perspective and that of this committee, we are aware of the positive changes in this regard, including in respect of means testing, etc.  This committee's role is to challenge the everyday norms we see in our society.<\/p><p>The fact is that normality is not working for many people at the minute.  As Ms Paula Soraghan from County Louth said on behalf of Independent Living Movement Ireland at a meeting of this committee a few weeks ago, disabled people have so much potential that society thinks they do not have, but the State does not facilitate them.  It is about creating the choice.  At the minute, they do not have that choice.  The choice is not there.  This committee wants to instil that equity and to make sure we put that equity into the system.  I refer to equity as opposed to equality.<\/p><p> I have a number of points that I would like the Minister to take on board.  I have a request, which has been spoken about by other members.  My first ask, which Deputy Higgins has mentioned, is about the individualisation of reasonable accommodation grants.  The Minister mentioned that it would be up to the Department, but people with disabilities who work for our local authorities are told to put forward a business case for assistive technology.  They are then told that they do not satisfy a business case and they do not get that assisted technology.  They are not granted it.  They are left to stew.  They do not have the ability to progress in their employment because they do not have the leg up, or they have to get that technology themselves.  Most often, as so many people have highlighted here today, the cost of those disabilities prohibit people from being able to afford the technology themselves.  I urge the Department to move and to change.  The Minister said a little while ago that the Minister and the Department always want to do more.  We are asking them to do things differently, along with doing more.  This is about changing how the Department looks at the social benefits that are provided to people with disabilities, so that we move from a medical model towards the social and rights-based model of which Deputy Hourigan previously spoke.<\/p><p> For instance, there should be a move towards a care means test, as opposed to a financial means test, for carer's allowance.  We need the individualisation of benefits to reduce a person&rsquo;s dependency on another person.  It was highlighted during our session on women with disabilities that people do not move in with their partners because they will lose their independence if they move in with someone they love.  This is because their disability allowance would be means tested and they might lose it.  They would lose that independence.  The softie in me thinks it is heartbreaking that someone would not move on in a relationship for fear of losing their benefits because they would be means tested and would lose their independence.<\/p><p> I suggest to the Minister - I know that she and her Department would be very open to this - that the personal assistance service should be moved from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection because these are social rights as opposed to medical rights and medical assistance.  Personal assistance is not about medical assistance.  It is about social assistance to be able to facilitate people to take up jobs, go to the library, go out and meet friends and do all of the normal things that many of us take for granted.<\/p><p> I have mentioned a few challenges for the Minister, and I have many questions.  I will mention another point that I would like the Minister and her Department to take on board.  Although I do not expect answers today, I would really like the Minister and her Department to take them on board and to consider them.  I ask her to open up the travel scheme and have a review of it to make sure it has more flexibility built into it when it comes to conditions such as epilepsy.  If someone with epilepsy, for example, is not allowed to drive for a certain length of time, flexibility should be built into the system in order that he or she might be able to get free travel for a short period of time - perhaps six months or whatever the medical timeframe is - until they are permitted to drive.  If they were able to get free travel for that period, they would be able to travel to work.  They would not be taken out of work and that their life would be made a little easier.<\/p><p> My big ask is for flexibility and individualisation to be built into the system.  We know that the system is robust.  The Minister articulates that very well, as she does for all of the schemes within her Department.  However, we want to build difference into the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#K01100","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The focus of my Department has to be, and has always been, to provide an income support - a basic income - to help people when they need it.  That is the number one focus of this Department.  It is not a service support.  Services come from other Departments.  I know the point that the Senator is making, but a change to individualisation would be a fundamental change to the social welfare system.  We should bear in mind that individualisation would have winners and losers.  I remember somebody once said to me, \"If I solved that problem, I would create about ten more.\"  I think he was a Minister for Health at the time.<\/p> <p>  I take the Senator's point that we could change things.  Where we see opportunities to change things, we will change them.  If we can do so without causing unintended consequences across other areas, we will certainly do that.  That is why we continue to review all of our different supports right across the board.  We take on and listen to the views.  We are at this committee today to hear everybody&rsquo;s views.  I am answering questions.  We take on board the views that the committee is giving to us today.  We include those views as part of our consideration when we are looking at different schemes and looking at how we can make them better.<\/p> <p>  On the individualisation of reasonable accommodation grants, and particularly assistive technology, we are doing a review of that scheme at the minute.  First, it is underused.  It is actually quite a good grant.  A maximum grant of &euro;6,350 is available towards the cost of adaptation to premises or equipment.  Applications in excess of this sum are considered on an individual basis, up to a maximum of &euro;9,523, if specialist training for assistive technology is required.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made a point about the local authorities.  We would like to think that the public service would lead and that we would not have to be giving it money to do these things.  In fairness to the local authorities, they are getting a good deal of support across all the different Departments to deliver on behalf of the Government.  In the Department of Rural and Community Development, for instance, there has been a massive multi-million euro investment into local authorities.  I think they should be looking at this themselves, to be quite honest with the Senator.  They have unprecedented investment to provide housing through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and indeed across other Departments as well.  I take the Senator's point, but they have to prioritise as well.  That is what they have to do.  I do not want one part of government to be subsidising another part of government for something it should be doing in the first place.  It is clear, as part of Government policy, that we want to see people who have disabilities being assisted to come into the workplace.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the free travel scheme, which is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active in their community.  She raised the issue of people with epilepsy.  I have looked at that and am considering it.  Epilepsy is one illness, but I am sure there are other illnesses, where people with the condition can only drive for a limited time.  Where does one stop?  People who are blind are eligible for free travel.  People who are blind are blind and that is it.  For people who have a condition from which they can recover and, with the right medication, improve their situation, it starts to get more difficult.  Resources are finite.  We do not have an unlimited pot, despite what some people may think.  For this reason, we have to target where we believe resources are most needed.  I am looking at the issue of people with epilepsy.  It was raised with me by a Deputy in the D&aacute;il and I said I would look at it.  I met the organisation that represents people with epilepsy.  The matter is ongoing.  I will leave it at that.

Financial supports give disabled people tools and opportunities to be able to go about their daily lives, in the context of their basic needs.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, I was speaking to a person around language coming in to this committee, and not wanting to offend or insult anybody.  I did not know this until I had that conversation with her.  She said it is society that disables people.  I could not believe that I, who has been in this line of work for more than ten years, had not put that into my own sense of things.  When she said it to me, it made so much sense.  We are the problem.  It is not the people with the disability or those who are disabled who are the problem.  We are the problem as a society and as a system.  As Deputy Cairns said, the system is not working and we have to look at that.<\/p> <p>  In 2022, the rate of poverty and social exclusion was 36.9% for disabled people and just 13.2% for non-disabled people.  We are talking about the roadmap of social inclusion.  These targets are not very ambitious.  In fact, the indication is that the rate of poverty for disabled people has increased since 2020 because of the raising of rents, the impact of the pandemic, as well as fuel and food costs.  The cost of living has gone up so much.  It affects elderly people as well.  Once they are over 66 years, are they entitled to disability benefits?  There is a rate of just over &euro;200 a week for people who have a disability.  Deputy Cairns touched on this.  I continue to help people with the application forms.  If people have a severe intellectual disability, what supports are available to them to fill out those forms?  I understand there are local community development organisations that are good on the ground and work with people who have disabilities to help them fill out these application forms.  I want to know how those groups are supported in order to support people with disabilities when filling out those forms?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that there are more than 6,000 people employed by the Department of Social Protection.  For the record, how many of those people have identified as having a disability or as being disabled?  I refer to the motto \"Nothing about us without us\".  As a Traveller woman, I know the importance of that and of listening to people who have disabilities and are disabled.  We need to be very careful with our language going forward, such as saying that we are helping them or have got them bus passes.  We need to look at our language and think before we speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#M00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  First, I do not know whether she was here for all of my contribution, but I have said a number of times this morning that we need to empower people.  The Department wants to give people who have disabilities the opportunity to participate fully in society but also to empower them.  The most important way by which anybody is empowered is to have the opportunity to go to work.  I am absolutely committed to supporting people with disabilities in finding employment and to trying to break down any barriers that exist between the employee and the employer.  The employability programme is doing great work in that space.  That is why, when the funding for the ability programme was due to finished last year, I met Des Henry and the relevant groups.  They are providing wonderful support to young people with disabilities to help them get back into the workforce.  There are many different types of disabilities and they were able to support them.  They have done good work in that regard.  That is why I took money from the Dormant Accounts Fund to make sure funding continued when the EU funding ceased.  We are making another application for similar EU funding.  To be fair, it is about supporting and, most important, empowering people to realise their full potential.  That is what we are about in the Department of Social Protection.  As I said, our purpose is to ensure people have a basic income.  There is a basic payment but there are also many add-ons to that, in terms of different supports that a person can get in my Department and other Departments.  I outlined them earlier so I will not go through them again.<\/p> <p>  As to the cost of disability, we commissioned the Indecon report on the cost of disability.  It was published and we are acting on it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is chairing a steering group.  However, this relates to more than one Department.  I do not have to tell the Senator that.  It is right across the Government.  The Minister of State is pulling together the Departments.  The steering group will make findings which will be acted on and brought to the Government in due course.<\/p> <p>  On assisting people with disabilities, we have the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, which falls under the remit of the Citizens Information Board.  It is available to help people and advocates for those who have disabilities.  The service is fully funded by my Department.  We also have the Citizens Information Board to help people.  I can honestly say that when people with disabilities go into Intreo offices, they will be treated with dignity and respect, as everybody is treated, to be fair.  The Senator can rest assured that they will get the support they need.<\/p> <p>  On the Department's staff, as of 31 December 2021, 6.5% of departmental staff identified as having a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#M00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":714,"content":"<p>Is the Senator okay with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#M00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I have one final question.<\/p><p>How much does it cost the State every year to means test the grant payment support scheme?

I had to run in and out of another committee meeting where a quorum was required.  I apologise for that.  I thank the Minister for taking the time to meet the committee today.<\/p> <p>  We have been very clear in all our deliberations that we need to have a cross-governmental approach.  We cannot have a situation where the challenges and issues that impact on people with disabilities are siloed into one particular area.  In the past year and a half, having had the opportunity to engage with so many people about their lived experience with disabilities, it has been very clear that we need to have this type of engagement with Ministers in every area of Cabinet.  We appreciate the Minister giving her time.  I look forward to seeing her later in Kildare.  We are all under pressure.  The Minister will get to see some of the very positive projects in south Kildare.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about empowering people with disabilities and rightly so.  This has to be the number one priority for all of us on the committee and across the Government.  It is about giving everybody the opportunity to live in society with dignity and to be able to contribute to society and live independently.  As the Minister rightly stated, it also includes being able to secure employment.  Sadly, we do not have a good record when it comes to people with disabilities accessing employment.  It is good to see it improving.  I know Mr. Des Henry very well and I applaud the work he does.  He has been involved in WALK and setting up the internship programme in Leinster House.  There will be a briefing on this later.  Ours is the first parliament to establish such a programme.  Three quarters of those involved in the first programme were able to get permanent jobs afterwords, including two in Leinster House.  It was worth doing.  We need to do more.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the Minister had the opportunity earlier to address the areas that are of concern to me.  These include the Indecon report that came from the Department on the cost of disability.  We come to the dichotomy between equality and equity.  Equality does not mean equity.  We know that the cost of disability ranges from &euro;10,000 per annum to &euro;12,000 per annum.  It is about how we have an equal playing field.  People start with this as a minus in terms of trying to make ends meet, which is difficult for everybody during these times.  We have to look at ways we can ensure this is taken into account in the Department and across the realm.  Does the solution lie in introducing a cost of disability payment in order to allow people living with disability to achieve the same standard of living as those who do not have disabilities?  This would remove a barrier in terms of financial independence.<\/p> <p>  Another area of concern is the means testing of disability payments.  It undermines disabled people's choice and control over their own lives and restricts their ability to choose where and with whom to live as support is tied to that person.  At a previous meeting I mentioned a young lady I know who lives with a disability.  She is in a wheelchair.  Her husband, by virtue of his work, is abroad quite a bit.  She often brings her children to school.  She is in a wheelchair and they walk beside her.  I was shocked when she contacted me, having already known her, to find she did not get any disability payment whatsoever.  She has to ask her husband for money for period products.  She has no access to any individual payment for herself.  I have major concerns about this.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that there is not an infinite purse and that we cannot do everything we would like to do.  The Minister spoke about supports for those who have more of a need, and I accept this.  For those who have an invisible disability, it is very difficult for them to access the supports they need because their disability is not perceived as being serious enough.  Sometimes a small intervention to help them goes a long way . Those are the questions and comments I wish to put to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#N00800","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments.  She mentioned the cost of disability and the report.  What is clear from the report is that the cost of disability is significantly broader than income supports.  It is clear that it will not be addressed through income support alone.  A basic standard income support for all people with disabilities is unlikely to address the costs incurred by those most severely limited by their disabilities.  As the Senator said, and we have discussed it, some people have severe disabilities and others have disabilities that are less severe.  We need to target it where it is needed most.  A one-size-fits-all approach is not fit for purpose.  At present, it is flat across the board.<\/p> <p>  One of the recommendations in the cost of disability report is that those with more severe disabilities need the greatest support.  For those with less severe disabilities, we can empower them and help them to get into the workplace and become more independent.  A number of measures will be examined.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, has established a committee that will go through all of these issues in detail.  The Senator is correct that it requires a cross-governmental approach.  It is not just about one Department.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, she is pulling it all together.  This is the first time it is being done.  I will support her in every way I can, as I know the Senator will.  It is the right way to go about it I have no doubt about this.  We have this comprehensive report and we can continue to work on it and make sure we get the right outcomes.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the means test.  It ensures not only that recipients across the board have an income need but also that the scarce resources are targeted at those with the greatest need.<\/p><p>The disability allowance currently has the highest capital disregard of any scheme operated by the Department.  A recipient can have up to &euro;50,000 in savings and still receive the full rate of payment.  This is something that was brought to my attention.  It used to be &euro;20,000.  I increased it in the most recent budget to &euro;50,000, which was very much welcomed by the disability groups at the time.  Of course, the disability allowance recipients may work and earn up to &euro;140 per week without it affecting their payment.  People receiving disability allowance may also be eligible for secondary benefits, such as free travel, fuel allowance, the household benefits package, the living alone allowance and the telephone support allowance.  Depending on their circumstances, recipients may also be entitled to rent supplement or housing assistance payment to help meet housing expenses.  Removing the means test for disability allowance would have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across all schemes.<\/p><p> Again, as the Senator will appreciate, there have to be rules for schemes.  Unfortunately, when we have rules, there are always those who fall marginally inside or outside them.  Even though I increased the limits, as I did in the budget, no matter how much the change is, there is always going to be somebody who falls outside the scheme.  If somebody has real financial problems such that they cannot meet their commitments, under the supplementary social welfare allowance there is an urgent needs payment and an essential needs payment.  If anybody has difficulty in meeting some of their costs currently, and we know the cost of living has gone up, they can go to the community welfare officer and apply for an urgent needs payment to help them with the difficulties they are having.  That is the State support; it is the safety net that the State has to help people who get into difficulty.  We are here to help, and that is the one message I want to get out there today.  Right across the board, the purpose of social protection is to give that financial support to people when they need it.<\/p><p> I look forward to seeing the Senator later.  If we do not get going soon, we will be late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#N00900","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I will be late anyway, but I will catch up with the Minister at some stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#O00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Deputy Cairns has two points to make and I also have a question, so we are nearly finished.

Why can somebody with a disability or a disabled person not save more than that?  It leaves them out of being able to save for things like buying a home or earning an income without having this consequence of disability.<\/p> <p>  To move to my two questions, the enhanced illness benefit form online is much simpler than the paper version.  The illness benefit and back to school clothing and footwear allowance forms are not available for download.  Will the Minister commit to having all forms available in plain English and available online?<\/p> <p>  Second, the pandemic highlighted issues of digital poverty.

I thank the Minister for her contributions and for her tour of the various Departments and schemes.  She stated earlier that she is here to help.  There are many people who are dependent on State support throughout their lives, and this has been particularly reflected in the evidence we have heard at the disability committee.  The Minister spoke about carers and the various efforts that have been made.  There is one question with regard to carers.  Carer&rsquo;s benefit was brought in more than 20 years ago and it was based on contributions.  It has been very successful in allowing people to come out of employment to care for a loved one, whether a sibling, a child or a parent who might need them.  In many cases, there is a lifelong need for care for a sibling or child but the benefit only lasts two years.  It is based on a person's employment contributions.  Is there scope to look at carer&rsquo;s benefit being extended beyond the two years?  I see many cases coming through, particularly for the care of a sibling or a child, where one or other of the partners gives up their full-time employment to provide care.  They get the carer&rsquo;s benefit for two years and then they are onto the means tested payments, where, because of the spousal partner being over the limit, the only grant they get is the &euro;1,800.  While it is welcome that the grant has been increased, some flexibility is needed.<\/p> <p>  The language I would like to see is that it would be care assessed rather than means assessed.  This issue should be looked at.  It is a big volume of work to do but it is very important.  People are providing full-time care for a family member.  In overall monetary terms, they are probably saving the State a considerable amount of money but this would also recognise them as full-time carers.  The two things that could be done are the extension of the carer&rsquo;s benefit and ensuring it is care assessed rather than means assessed for people who have the necessity for full-time care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022032400002#O00500","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I want to be clear.  I am outlining what we have done in the Department, but I never said that is enough.  In response to Deputy Cairns, we want to do more.  I am certainly not sitting here, saying we are doing a great job; I am telling her what we have done.  We increased it from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  I think that is progress and I want to see more progress.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Chairman's question on carer&rsquo;s benefit, we are paying almost &euro;1 billion to carers as matters stands.  It is a substantial scheme.  All of the benefits schemes are time-limited and carer&rsquo;s benefit is for two years, although jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is much shorter and maternity benefit is 26 weeks.  This has been extended over time.  I take the Chairman's point that somebody who is on carer&rsquo;s benefit might continue to care for longer than two years and would have to be means tested.  We have increased that.  It will kick in in June so it should make a difference to people.  That means people can have &euro;750 of income coming into the house and can have savings of &euro;50,000 from the beginning of June, and they can still qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance.

I know we will try to get through a significant amount of business today, both the motion before us and Committee Stage of the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022.  I will, therefore, keep my opening statement short.<\/p> <p>  Today is a significant day for the people of the south east and higher education in the region.  We are taking a firm step towards the establishment of the new technological university on 1 May.  I am sure the D&aacute;il, Seanad and committee records and media coverage locally will show that there has been much debate about a technological university for the south east for a very long time.  There have been false dawns, ups and downs and disagreements but we are now finally at a point where I am bringing to this committee the draft order which, subject to the committee's scrutiny and approval, I hope to ask D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to approve very shortly.<\/p> <p>  The Technological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) (No. 2) Order 2022 is an order under the Technological Universities Act.  It must do two things, namely, choose the day on which the new technological university is established and decide a new name for the technological university.  As the Chairman will know, the order then needs to be approved by resolution in each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I propose that we set a date of 1 May 2022, as promised to the people of the south east, as the date for the establishment of the new technological university and that it will be known as the \"South East Technological University\" or \"Ollscoil Teicneola&iacute;ochta an Oirdheiscirt\" in the Irish language.  The signing of this order will bring about the dissolution of the Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology.  I am very conscious that this will be the fifth technological university to have been established.  To establish a technological university one must dissolve the institutes of technology.  That can be quite an emotional moment in many ways because people have dedicated their careers to building institutes of technology that we can be really proud of.  I pay tribute to everybody in Carlow Institute of Technology, CIT, and Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, who have worked so hard to get us to this point.  I can say categorically that we would not be at this point of being able to establish a technological university for the south east were it not for all of the progress, work and efforts of those two institutes of technology over many years.  I greatly appreciate the leadership shown by all of their staff, students and student bodies, which have provided huge support.<\/p> <p>  This will be the fifth technological university in the State.  That is another important milestone for the country and the south east.  The new technological university will provide a multi-campus university presence, as people know.  The new technological university will increase access to higher education, drive enhanced regional development and increase opportunities for students, staff, business and enterprise, and local communities.  It will deliver a higher education institution of scale and reach, which will benefit many students in the region.  I look forward to seeing these benefits and the south east and the new technological university take their rightful place in the higher education landscape in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The lacuna that has existed for years is now closed.  The establishment of the South East Technological University will allow people throughout the region to obtain a university degree in their home place.  I am delighted to see that milestone being reached and congratulate all involved.<\/p> <p>  While we often have rows in this place, which is healthy in a democracy, I acknowledge the cross-party support that has largely existed for this project.  The Chairman has been a driving force in this for many years.

The technological university of the south east will now be known as the South East Technological University, SETU.  It has been important in terms of balanced regional development and is twice referenced in the programme for Government.  I am delighted that the timetables are being adhered to and that we will be able to make the commencement order for 1 May.  That is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  It goes some way towards tackling a structural issue that has existed in the south-east region for generations.  To take the example of my family, of the four children, three of us attended Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, in one capacity or another, but all four of us had to leave the region in order to finish our education.  That pattern has a significant effect on the demographics of the region.  That is demonstrated in the research and it is well acknowledged.  The region has been losing people from the ages of 18 to 30 and it very often struggles to get them back.  It has a significant impact on the wealth of the region because there is a significant wealth transfer as parents pay for their children to attend universities outside the region.  This goes some way towards addressing that problem.  It is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the Minister referenced the bittersweet nature of signing an order such as this, in that WIT and IT Carlow are being dissolved.  They have proud traditions.  I am biased in this regard, but WIT in particular has a proud tradition.  Even reaching back to when it was Waterford Regional Technical College, WRTC, it has provided an outstanding service to the people of Waterford and the wider south-east region.  I reference again its geographic location within the city.  That is important because I know the Minister is committed to expanding the footprint of SETU within Waterford.  I am anxious that we expand the current footprint because it sits within its communities and its city extremely well.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, I remember when WIT was WRTC.  Promises and commitments were given at that time that the name change would mean something more than changing the sign above the door.  It is extremely important that this name change means more than changing the sign over the door.  It must be the university of substance and scale to which we have referred.  I know this is not necessarily the day to speak about capital allocations but that is important.  As we say as Gaeilge, we must beart de r&eacute;ir &aacute;r mbriathar.  We must deliver on what this university promises to be by ensuring there is a commensurate level of commitment in terms of capital funding and otherwise.<\/p> <p>  However, I welcome this day.  It is an important step along the road.  It is important that those who are currently attending WIT and IT Carlow will be able to graduate from a university and with a university qualification.  I very much hope it will be the anchor point and the pivotal point for a regeneration of the south-east region, and Waterford in particular.  I thank the Minister for bringing the motion before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032400002#B00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>As a person from the south east, I know the importance of this.  It was very much part of the programme for Government when I sat at the Cabinet table in 2011.  We thought we would reach this point before now but there have been many false dawns in recent years.  The establishment of the technological university is very welcome.  The fact it will be established on May Day sends a strong message.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is correct that we would not be here if it were not for the work and commitment of the staff and others involved in IT Carlow and WIT through many years.  We have to recognise the work of Jim Moore and John Moore, the chairmen of the governing bodies, in recent years.  Those gentlemen have worked closely together and brought this project to where it is today.  I also recognise Patricia Mulcahy and the governing bodies.  There was a willingness to do this because they saw the importance of driving and enhancing foreign direct investment in the south east.<\/p> <p>  Today is not the day to discuss capital investment but I concur with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's point that this is not just about a name change and that there is a need for investment to drive this project.  I know the Minister has stated that and committed to it.  <\/p> <p>  I will be parochial and mention the Wexford campus.  Work in that regard is ongoing with Wexford County Council and the Minister's Department in the context of a compulsory purchase order for a site.  That is very welcome.  There are different parts to that project now, including buying the site and then getting the infrastructure and faculty into the south east.  I know the Minister will continue to be committed to this project.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh referred to the lost generation who had to leave the south east to go to Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Maynooth or elsewhere for their education.  There is an opportunity now for students to remain in the south east and to be educated, live and rear their families there.  They did not have that opportunity previously.<\/p> <p>  The big winner in this will come in the context of driving and enhancing foreign direct investment.  IDA Ireland has indicated to me that one of the specific issues in that regard is education and the lack of a university.  That will no longer be an issue as we will have a university in the south east.  I thank the Minister for his dedication to this project.  I also thank the Secretary General and all the officials in his Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032400002#B00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; Cathasaigh and the Chairman.  I wish to acknowledge - I have never had cause to do so previously - Deputy Cullinane, who has been very active and helpful in the context of this project.  The points made in respect of resources and leadership are valid and important.  I can come back to the committee for a discussion on resources for technological universities in greater detail but I point out that there are dedicated funds now for technological universities, with the technological university transformation fund being one such fund.  Our intention is to secure through the European Regional Development fund a specific research fund that only technological universities will be allowed to draw down.  In the context of the south east in particular, the capital plan contains specific ring-fencing for a project to expand the footprint in Waterford and to finally secure a site in Wexford.  I am satisfied in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The point in respect of leadership is also really important.  The signs so far are encouraging.  The fact that Dr. Paddy Prendergast, the former provost of Trinity College Dublin, put his name forward  to chair this governing authority was a real vote of confidence in the new technological university.<\/p><p>The process to recruit the first president is under way.  While I am not directly involved in that process, my understanding is that there is significant interest in it, which is a good sign.  I think the final round of interviews for that position will likely be held towards the latter half of April.  My Department will keep the committee informed in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh knows the importance of this in a real and meaningful way as a former student of WIT.  He pointed out the significant reality for Waterford and the south east that people have had to leave the region to complete their education.  That is not acceptable.  People should be able to access all levels of the Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, framework within the region.  Furthermore, people should be able to come from other regions to the south east if they want to go to a technological university there because it is the best place to study A, B or C.  This new technological university needs to decide where it will fit as to what it wants to be the best at in this country and in Europe.<\/p><p> As for this being more than a name change, that is a real issue.  It is entirely understandable that in Waterford there will be a healthy degree of scepticism until the people there see shovels in the ground or real and meaningful investment.  I said that when I was on WLR with Damien Tiernan on my recent visit.  I fully get that.  We have &euro;430 million, I think, in capital investment to spend between now and 2024.  Most of that is by competitive call.  We have identified only a very small number of projects as wishing to work outside of that competitive call process.  One is the expansion of the Waterford site, that is, the expansion of the physical footprint of the university of Waterford.  The other is the securing of a site, working with Wexford County Council, for a Wexford campus.  We will put our money where our mouth is in that regard.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chair, for rightly praising the work of the outgoing chairs of the governing authorities, Jim Moore in Waterford and John Moore in Carlow.  I thank both for their leadership.  We will talk about higher education governance in legislation in a moment.  Serving on a governing authority can often be a thankless job.  It epitomises a commitment to community and public service.  I thank Jim Moore and John Moore, all members of the governing authorities and the presidents of the institutions for their leadership in that regard.<\/p><p> The Chairman and I talk regularly about our commitment and the Government's commitment to securing a site in Wexford.  I reiterate that commitment on the record of the committee today.  I also thank Tom Enright, the chief executive of Wexford County Council, and the council itself for its leadership in helping us to secure that site and the legal mechanisms they have had to work on with us in that regard.  I am delighted to say we have now provided the necessary sanctions through our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get on with that.  That work is very much under way and it is full steam ahead.  Yesterday, while attending a summit on green skills and the retrofitting agenda in Wexford County Council with the Chairman, I was delighted to see the energy the council is applying to this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032400002#B00500","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, was to be here.

This is a fabulous opportunity for the south east.  As a student, I attended university in Waterford back when it transferred from WRTC to WIT in the 1990s.  I will have to admit that my first protest was one fighting for facilities to be delivered on campus in Waterford in 1996, when we sat on the bridge to get a library, which was delivered a couple of years later.  I participated in only the second protest in my life a couple of weeks ago outside the Russian embassy.  It just goes to show I do not protest too often because I think dialogue and debate are far more lucrative in delivering.  That said, this has taken a very long time.  As the Chair said, it has been on the Cabinet's agenda for many years, so I congratulate the new Department and the Minister on the initiative to bring this forward right across the country, but particularly for the south east, with which I have a particular affinity.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the Minister referred to the specific capital funding for technological universities because it is important that the regions are provided with sufficient resources to keep up with their urban or city universities and educational campuses.

Nobody played politics with it, at least not until the election of some new Members to the D&aacute;il, albeit none from any political party.

Of all the technological universities, this project has required the most time and assistance from my Department officials and me, but it was worth it and was important to do because we see this as vital for the south east.  We see it as more than that, though.  We see it as an important piece of national infrastructure.  I think IDA Ireland, to name just one agency, would very much agree with that.

I thank Senator Flynn for her work and how it relates to my Department.  I assure her there is an open door policy in my Department in respect of her work.  We want to do whatever we can to learn from the Senator's work on diversity and inclusion.  I found her recent address to the D&aacute;il inspiring in regard to these issues and we are eager to work with her.  I will answer her questions as best I can, but I would also like to learn from her insights into and understanding of these issues and how we can do more in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Regarding diversity and inclusion, the Technological Universities Act 2018 - and this is from memory because I do not have a copy in front of me - has specific provision for flexibility regarding the design of courses.  There are a number of ways to increase access and inclusion, one of which is often to provide courses in a way that is flexible and can work for learners from a variety of backgrounds.  Not everybody can pack their bags and head off to university for four years.  The perception that that is what people must do can be a barrier.  The Technological Universities Act 2018 requires that a certain number of courses be designed in a flexible manner.  How we harness that is part of the answer to this question.  <\/p> <p>  The broader answer, though, is not specific to the technological universities, but is more concerned with the new national access and inclusion plan we are likely to publish in the next month or so.  I am pleased to say there is quite a bit of resourcing behind this plan.  For example, &euro;5 million is being provided this year, and the presumption is that &euro;5 million will also be provided each year to 2025.  In that plan, we will be setting new targets and objectives regarding what success in inclusion and access will look like over the next few years and what we must do to achieve them.  I will be delighted to brief Senator Flynn, and the committee at the appropriate time, on that.  It will be the vehicle through which we will try to drive this agenda.<\/p> <p>  On access to digital devices, I am proud that our Department and sector have provided free digital devices where required.  This is something we could look at doing more broadly in parts of society.  We purchased just under 17,000 laptops as part of our response to Covid-19 and gave them out, effectively, through access offices.  One of the reasons I did that was because one of the first meetings I had was with representatives of Pavee Point.  I remember meeting a young student at Maynooth University who told me she had to do her college thesis on her smartphone while sitting in the car.  That is just unacceptable.  She said having the laptop was transformational for her.  The broadband issue is a little outside my remit.  While there is a strong focus on remote working hubs, I think they should be referred to as remote working and learning hubs because they will help with the broadband issue in the interim as we roll them out to communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032400002#D00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032400002#D00300","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":752,"content":"<p>On the Seanad, I will get into all sorts of trouble no matter what answer I give.

It is another way of getting a third-level qualification, but people who do apprenticeships do not get a vote for the Seanad.  How then can we go into schools and talk about parity of esteem?

That is my rationale for the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022032400002#B00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":766,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an leas&uacute; mar gheall go mbeadh s&eacute; ag clo&iacute; le polasa&iacute; an Rialtais &oacute; thaobh Bill&iacute; eile.

There is nothing to prevent it from referring to itself as \"the Higher Education Authority\" or referring to itself bilingually, but officially its title should be &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas.

It does not relate to this matter, but I believe I am meant to put on record that section 1 is proposed to be revised in regard to collective citations.  It is largely a technical matter but this legislation is dealing with the Universities Act, the Technological Universities Act, the Institutes of Technology Acts and the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  Significant amendments have been made to the latter, and collective citations will now be considered by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputies Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; Laoghaire for the amendment.  I am introducing ten amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the role of the Irish language in this legislation.  I genuinely acknowledge Deputy Conway-Walsh's work on this and her highlighting the matter on Second Stage and at meetings with my officials.  I also thank Conradh na Gaelige, with which I have had several significant engagements over recent weeks.  There was a quite detailed meeting in my Department at which we went through a long list of ways in which the body believes we can strengthen the legislation, most of which I have been able to accommodate and facilitate.  No doubt we will tease through the rest as we go through the legislation.  There are to be ten Government amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the promotion of the Irish language in this Bill.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 1.  I happy to consider the matter it further between now and Report Stage and to engage further with the Deputy on it.  However, my rationale is that the Bill is replacing and amending the Higher Education Authority Act 1971.  The proposal was that we would retain the same name for the 2022 legislation.  The 1971 Act and this Bill refer to the Irish name, an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas.  There are several references to \"An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s\".  The body was established in 1971.  Section 7 provides for the continuance of \"An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas\".  \"An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s\" is defined in the Bill.  The Higher Education Authority is most commonly known as the Higher Education Authority or as the HEA.  It is anticipated that a proposed change of the name to the Bill could cause some confusion.  There are significant references to the Irish language in the Bill.  More important, there will be more references and protections as we go through Committee Stage.  I understand the point being made and am happy to reflect further and engage between now and Report Stage, but I am very satisfied that the substantive amendments we are introducing to promote the Irish language within higher education will make a real and meaningful difference to the Irish language when the legislation is passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022032400002#B00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I accept that and am glad we will continue this discussion, but I really believe we need to set the parameters for this.

It is used in amendments to section 37 and other amendments.  I am open to views and input on the most appropriate definition for the commonly-used concept of core funding, but it is important that we set it aside because when we listened to witnesses who appeared before this committee regarding additional funding, core funding is integral to everything that we do.  The intention of amendment No. 94 to section 37 and the reason for including the definition is to ensure that for-profit private colleges could never be eligible for core funding.  It is, in effect, to make it impossible for private colleges to receive State funding in the same manner as public institutions.  I limited this to core funding only, since private colleges currently receive funding in a number of ways.  It is important to note, therefore, that this amendment does not change the current <i>status quo<\/i>.  It will only ensure the continuation of the current approach to funding higher education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022032400002#D00600","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 94.  I will deal with the two issues they relate to.  I will deal with the matter of the \"relevant body\" in a constructive fashion and I suggest that if we need to tease through it more on Report Stage, we can do so.  I am informed that the term \"relevant body\" is already defined in section 36(7) of the Bill in the same manner as the amendment and is already used in sections 35 and 36 of the Bill.  As these amendments are linked to section 37 and they need to be considered in the context of the meaning of the proposed amendment to that section.  I contend that the \"relevant body\" piece, as defined in amendment No. 4, is dealt with in the Bill as I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely see what the Deputy is trying to achieve on the core funding piece.  I will be very clear that there is no policy intention, nor any entitlement in the passage of this legislation, that even a designated institution automatically has a right to core funding.  There is no policy intention whatsoever to provide core funding to for-profit private institutions.  I take the point that the Deputy wants to legislate against that.  The current provisions of section 37 of the Bill are that the HEA, with the approval of the Minister of the day, prepares and establishes the funding framework for the allocation of funding to those institutions of higher education and other bodies that we specify in section 37(1) of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  This amendment seeks to extract, as the Deputy outlined, a subset of that framework and provide that the HEA may provide core funding to universities, technological universities, institutes of technology or the National College of Art and Design, NCAD.  Without being too technical about it, it is not that the HEA \"may\".  The HEA already provides core funding to these institutions but it also provides core funding to a small number of other institutions that are not universities, technological universities, institutes of technology or the NCAD.  I am not trying to misrepresent the Deputy as I know this is not her policy intention, but if we take this amendment as worded, the advice available to me is the National College of Ireland, NCI, for example, or Mary Immaculate College, MIC, would not be captured in that amendment.  In short, we believe it is too rigid and does not provide the flexibility for the institutions that do not fit within the definition outlined by the Deputy, including MIC and NCI.<\/p> <p>  We have tried to keep section 37 at a high level in primary legislation to allow that flexibility in funding that is needed from time to time.  I again acknowledge the Deputy is trying to not interfere with that flexibility.  I get that but there is a concern among officials in my Department that it could be too prescriptive for scenarios that can arise from time to time where funding needs to be provided.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we believe the \"relevant body\" piece is already defined in the legislation, that the amendment, unintentionally, would leave out a small number of institutions that are not-for-profit, which is not the Deputy's intention, and that it is too prescriptive an amendment to put in primary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022032400002#D00700","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I appreciate what the Minister is saying.

One of the purposes of the Bill, however, is to provide a pathway to become a designated institution for institutions that are not currently designated as such.  We could pick a number of examples throughout the country.  What if a private college wished to become a public one?  People will be aware of the issue around Carlow College at present.  I am not proposing this is the path it is on; I am just using it as an example.  From time to time, issues can arise where institutions can look to become part of the higher education public landscape.  In this legislation, we are trying to do something we have not had before, which is to define a pathway to becoming a designated institution.  When I meet NCI representatives, for example, there is no doubt in my mind that it will be on this pathway.  I see the Deputy and I do not disagree on that.  I ask the Deputy to perhaps reflect on the policy intention she is trying to ensure between now and Report Stage.

These amendments proceed from the sustainable development goals, goal 4 in particular, which references quality education.  The sub-target SDG 4.7 specifically sets out a target of 2030 to ensure all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and recognises the important role of education in an increased understanding of sustainable development.<\/p><p>While sustainable development is referenced in particular in section 47(1)(j) of the Bill, amendment No. 3 is a definitional piece because the term &quot;sustainable development&quot; can be fluffy, for want of a better word, poorly understood and poorly defined.

Amendment No. 9 is the more substantive one because it seeks to introduce within the object of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s that designated institutions of higher education have a role in \"contributing to sustainable development, climate and biodiversity action, through research, innovation, leadership and governance\",  I am aware that some reference is made to those goals in the lifelong and flexible learning provision in section 47.  I make the argument, however, that to include it further and in a more important place in the Bill, under the objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, would give it a higher role, a higher profile and increased importance.<\/p><p> There are two factors at play here.

The short answer is I am happy to work with the Deputies between now and Report Stage to see how we can strengthen the legislation in respect of this matter.  As is often the case on Committee Stage, we can highlight all of the reasons we cannot do it exactly as it is outlined here.  That is a normal part of the back and forth.  I will work with the Deputies between now and Report Stage to see how we can try to achieve what the Deputies are endeavouring to do here.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 9, we contend there is already an object in the Bill, as the Deputy has acknowledged, relating to environmental development and sustainability.  Under section 8, objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, subsection (1)(b) provides that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s should have regard to this object in performing its functions: \"to support designated institutions of higher education in contributing to social, economic, cultural (including the promotion and use of the Irish language) and environmental development and sustainability through leadership, innovation and agility\".  Environmental development and sustainability are stated as part of the objects of the Higher Education Authority, which is important to say.  We would want to tease through what amendment No. 9 is doing that the object is not already achieving.<\/p> <p>  On some of the other amendments, there is a view we should not be overly prescriptive or detailed in primary legislation, because even for things that seem to last such a long time, the world can change so fast and primary legislation does not.  Definitions and goals can change from time to time.  We believe the reference to sustainable development is deemed sufficient and the provisions outlined in these amendments could be incorporated in these provisions when they are operationalised.  For the record, I also note that, under section 126, guidelines codes and policies can be issued to the designated institutions of higher education by the Higher Education Authority.  The HEA can issue guidelines codes and policies on sustainable development, including how this would link to lifelong and flexible learning.  The legislation is enabling the HEA to do things it has not been able to do before around guidelines, codes of practice and the like.  There is no doubt sustainable development is an area in which the HEA needs to be active.

At the outset, I want to recognise the fantastic work done by the Citizens' Assembly and the determination of the Deputies and Senators who make up this committee to see that its work is vindicated.  It is an objective that I, as Minister, and the Government share.<\/p> <p>  Committee members will no doubt agree that the task of setting ourselves towards real, measurable and meaningful advances that eliminate entrenched societal biases against women and girls remains an immense one, despite the progress which has been made to date.  As Minister with responsibility for equality, I recognise that a multi-faceted approach is necessary if we are to make those meaningful advances.<\/p> <p>  The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly is to be commended on the breadth of its work and the range of recommendations which cut across the areas of responsibility of many Ministers.  The Government is giving due consideration to the full range of recommendations, including key recommendations in respect of constitutional changes.  In this context, of course, the views of this committee are critical.  It is notable that the recommendations echo much of the six high-level objectives of the outgoing national strategy for women and girls, including socio-economic equality for women and girls, visibility in society and leadership of women and girls, and combating violence against women.  Work on the development of a successor strategy will begin this year with a consultation process and I expect the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly will play a key role in informing the priorities of that new strategy.<\/p> <p>  Many of the actions relate to areas where my Department is actively engaged, including on gender pay gap reporting.  As members are aware, the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021 introduced a legislative basis for gender pay gap reporting in Ireland and reporting by organisations with more than 250 employees will begin this year.  Regulations to give effect to that legislation are in preparation and will be published in the coming weeks along with guidance for employers.  An online reporting portal is planned for use in 2023 and will be publicly searchable.  Reporting requirements will be rolled out in the coming years to organisations with more than 150 employees and then organisations with more than 50 employees, eventually encompassing more than two thirds of employees in the State.  Gender pay gap reporting will help employers to identify the drivers behind their individual gender pay gaps and they will be required, in reporting, to explain their gender pay gap and to propose measures to address it.  It will also provide transparency for employees on which companies are doing the most to address their gender pay gap.  This will allow the Government to possibly take other targeted sectoral measures in future.<\/p> <p>  Family leave has a very important role in supporting women to remain in the workforce, as well as allowing both parents a better work-life balance, and the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly has reflected on this.  Significant advances in the provision of family leave have been made in recent years, including the introduction of paid parents' leave which provides an entitlement to each parent to encourage a sharing of the care of a child in his or her earliest years, as well as the extension of unpaid parental leave.  Parents&rsquo; leave is due to be extended again in July, which will bring the entitlement to seven weeks for each eligible parent, to be taken within the first two years of a child&rsquo;s life or adoptive placement.<\/p> <p>  I will shortly bring to Government legislative proposals to transpose the remaining elements of the EU work-life balance directive, including a right to request flexible working within the terms of the directive and an entitlement to leave for medical care purposes.  The legislation will also fulfil a long-standing Government commitment to extend the entitlement to breast-feeding breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts to two years.  As part of the Bill, I intend to introduce legislative provisions to enable a person avail of paid domestic violence leave as a statutory right.  I will touch more on this topic in a moment.<\/p> <p>  Another shared priority for my Department and the Citizens' Assembly is the availability of high-quality and affordable early learning and childcare.  My Department is progressing an expansive and radical set of reforms in this area, backed by a commitment to at least double State investment in early learning and childcare by 2028.  Recommendations by an expert group for a new funding model were accepted in full by the Government in December and my Department has commenced implementation.  This includes a new core funding scheme by September which will be worth &euro;221 million in a full year.  It aims to transform the sector and establish a new type of partnership between providers and the State that reflects the importance of early learning and childcare for the public good.  Core funding is designed to meet essential - and for many years elusive - objectives, including improved affordability for parents and improved quality through better pay and conditions for the predominately female workforce by supporting agreement on an employment regulation order through the joint labour committee.<\/p> <p>  Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare 2022-2028 was published in December.  It sets out a career framework for the sector and identifies a range of actions to strengthen career pathways for early learning educators and school-age childcare practitioners.  Commitments in the plan include the introduction of new supports to move to a graduate-led workforce, the introduction of a minimum qualification requirement for school-age childcare, the development and support of new training programmes for childminders, the development of a national infrastructure for continuing professional development for the sector and continued incremental movement towards the regulation of the profession.<\/p><p> I recognise that the invitation to meet with the committee today is to have a specific focus on the recommendations regarding constitutional change and on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, following on from the programme for Government audit on how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV is segmented across different Government agencies, it has been agreed that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will have lead responsibility for responding to DSGBV, and responsibility for policy, accommodation and services will sit within her Department also.<\/p><p> Tusla undertook the \"Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence\" to present recommendations on the future configuration of accommodation and services that may be required to holistically meet the needs of victims of DSGBV.  The Tusla review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provision of safe accommodation.  It recommends an approach to address these issues with immediate, medium and long-term actions required.  Priority areas for refuge development have been identified and an interdepartmental group has been established with a view to enact the recommendations of the review.<\/p><p> The third national strategy on DSGBV has been developed by the Department of Justice in consultation with organisations working in the DSGBV sector.  The stated overall goal of the strategy is zero tolerance in Irish society for DSGBV.  The strategy is structured under four pillars, aligning with the Istanbul Convention: prevention, protection, prosecution and co-ordinated policies.  I understand that the strategy will be published in April.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has signalled her intention to develop an implementation plan in which the number of refuge spaces available will meet Ireland's commitments under the Istanbul Convention.  Reformed structures for delivering refuge spaces, to accelerate the process and ensure a truly nationwide availability of services, will also be included in the new strategy.<\/p><p> In the interim, Tusla will continue to have responsibility for accommodation and services, while administrative arrangements are put in place for the Department of Justice to assume responsibility for this area.  My Department will continue to work with the Department of Justice and other Departments and agencies to ensure continuity and expansion of services to support victims of DSGBV.<\/p><p> With regard to the recommendations for constitutional change, the Citizens' Assembly recommendations involve the holding of referenda to strengthen the principle of gender equality in the Constitution and to address Article 41.2.<\/p><p> The committee has received briefings on the significant work undertaken in the past by relevant Departments and the Attorney General's office, including through a task force and an interdepartmental working group to examine provisions in other constitutions and to assess the legal implications of modifying Articles 40, 41 and 45.<\/p><p> Committee members will be aware that some complexity presents itself in developing a workable definition of care and care work which would potentially encompass a range of family relationships, care undertaken by those living within the home and outside it, both paid and unpaid, and which could involve care for children, older people and persons with disabilities or cognitive issues.  Notably, the definition of the family in the Constitution relates only to the marital family.  These are matters I hope the committee can bring their perspective and expertise to bear upon.<\/p><p> Pending a decision by the Taoiseach regarding whether and when a referendum will be taken, officials in my Department are reviewing the work undertaken to date as a first step.  I look forward to our discussions today.  Might I add my sincere congratulations to the Chair on her election as leader of the Labour Party today?  It is a proud day for the Chair, for her family, for the Labour Party and, if I can say so, for her former students as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#A00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":803,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I am following on from the Chair, who said it is not a rehashing of the why and this and that, but actually a follow-on implementation piece.  In that regard, the citizens were very clear that there should be constitutional change and their first three recommendations all relate to what proposals for constitutional change should be put to the public in a referendum or referenda.

Its options were a total removal of Article 41.2, a removal of Article 41.2 and a replacement with putting \"care\" into it or a removal of Article 41.2 and referencing care in Article 45.

Much work was done in the previous Oireachtas and it fell at the last hurdle.<\/p><p>I feel that having heard the Oireachtas was taking the decision that a committee was going to be formed to deal with the entire Citizens' Assembly recommendations, but particularly with those ones, for me to pre-empt that with wording would have been quite confrontational.  I do not think the committee would have appreciated that sort of intervention.  I am very open.  The reason I am here today is to work with the committee in terms of trying to identify collectively how we get past that issue of Article 41.2.  I am very open and I will continue to engage with members.  At some stage, however, a choice may have to be made amd it might not be everyone's preference.<\/p><p>I am conscious that we have had referendums in the past on issues that may have not seemed to be that contentious, which maybe did not have a very vigorous campaign and then had a low turnout.  Suddenly, there is a risk to the result.  I always think of the children's rights referendum, which everyone assumed would be a slam dunk and was 56% to 44%, which is far too close for comfort. The last thing we want is an approach to this amendment that becomes a bit <i>laissez-faire <\/i>but then maybe gets a bit divisive at the end and we end up losing it.  Then, we will never see this change.<\/p><p>I am very open to working with this committee.  It is important that we find agreement on the way forward, however, rather than the Government coming at one side and the Opposition or some Opposition parties coming very much from the other side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#D00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":824,"content":"<p>In the time remaining, I will ask about domestic violence paid leave.

If that had gone ahead, it would be the complete opposite of what the Citizens' Assembly said.  Our previous sessions found there is much clarity around what citizens were looking for from Article 41.2, which, as Senator Ruane said, is to put in care.  It is to ensure that we remove the gender-based nature and put in something that recognises care.  That is what the Irish people want.  That is what the Citizens' Assembly found.  That is, therefore, where the clarity is.  I hope what will come out of this will confirm that.  Every witness up until now has said that.  We had much clarity from Dr. Catherine Day around what went into the decision-making.<\/p> <p>  There may be some challenges with regard to the first recommendation on Article 40.1.  Some things have been highlighted by previous witnesses around how we actually ensure that we do not rewrite the Equality Acts, for instance, and then put it into the Constitution, or give preferential treatment to gender as the basis against which a person should not be discriminated.  Then, what about people's other rights, such as Traveller rights and so on?

Under Article 41.2, a woman's place is in the home.  Many women in Ireland would say that to have a home would be a great thing, but apart from that, there is a saying that the woman's place is in the revolution.  It is certainly in the social revolution and women are finding our voice.  Actually, we always had it.  We just did not have the mic.  A great deal of work has already been done on Article 41.2.  We had the Convention on the Constitution, which reported in May 2013.  We subsequently had a task force comprising officials from the then Department of Justice and Equality.  In July 2018, the then Taoiseach requested the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality of the time to consider the general scheme.  The urgency was so great that the committee was recalled from its summer recess to report on the matter.  I do not know whether there were women on the committee, but its members were brought out of their homes and back here to report, such was the level of urgency.<\/p> <p>  There is already a significant body of work for the Minister to go by.  I would like to see his proposal.  It would not be disrespectful to the committee.  Something I have learned in the two years since being elected is that committees work well across parties.  For the record, I will outline the bodies that have done work on this matter: the Constitutional Review Group; the Convention on the Constitution; the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution; the UN Human Rights Committee; the Irish Human Rights Commission; the National Women's Council of Ireland and other advocacy groups; the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality; and the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  It would be good if the Department worked on the wording now.  There is a great deal of legal expertise on this committee.  At the previous meeting, it was interesting to hear members going through the legal connotations.  Will the Minister commit to tabling his proposal before the summer recess?  Yesterday, I read a comment saying that the person who left everything until the last minute got all of his or her work done in a minute.  It is good to have a deadline.<\/p> <p>  Of recommendations Nos. 37 to 41, No. 37 has been taken by the Minister for Justice.  It is being dealt with by her Department solely.  That is great.  It is mad to think that, in 2022, we are more than 50% of the population yet we still need a national strategy for women and girls.  Here we are, though.<\/p><p>Sentencing is always frustrating.  Recommendation 38 states:<\/p><blockquote>\tEliminate tolerance in our society of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence by developing and implementing awareness, prevention and education campaigns which may include children. <\/blockquote><p>I know people say there is a certain tolerance in society, which gets the blame for everything in this country.  I argue against the idea that there is tolerance of gender-based violence in society.  The women of Ireland, all across the country, have had enough after Ashling Murphy was killed.  Candles were lit in every square.  I spoke in the D&aacute;il and said that society is waiting for the candles to be blown out so that we can get back to normal.  We repeatedly see sentencing that is insulting to the women of Ireland.  The tolerance in society is in the system, not the people.  A recommendation in the report relates to, &quot;Developing guidelines and specialist training for judges and lawyers&quot;.  We have to get on with that, as well as introducing tougher sentencing and rehabilitation programmes.  When I look at sentencing in courts, I do not know how much more women are prepared to take.  I know about the separation of powers and will not mention any cases.  I think the committee should concentrate on that.  I would like to see the Minister's Department working with the Department of Justice.<br\/><br\/>Will the Minister clarify the process which both Departments will use to make sure that we devise a proper policy that will be included in the national strategy for women and girls?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#E00900","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I know Deputy Cronin has always spoken of the position of women in the social revolution.  The two big social revolutions that have taken place in my lifetime are marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment, and the role of women was key in both, both for the national campaigns and on the ground at people's doors, as I know from my own constituency.  I cite those two because they are examples of where social revolution was achieved.  There was almost unanimity across the political spectrum for marriage equality and a significant majority supported repealing the eighth amendment, although I know there was not unanimity.  That is important with regard to delivering on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  We have seen pushback in certain parts of society on issues of equality and of recognition of families outside of marriage.  I fear that we could have an extremely divisive campaign where we would end up with political parties elevating the issue into part of the wider political discourse.  We have to avoid that.  That is why this committee will be so important and why I want to work with it to seek agreement on the wording, rather than letting it become divisive and flow into the wider tit-for-tat we see in the Chamber most days.  This is too important to risk being lost by being treated as normal politics.<\/p> <p>  There is a strong commitment across Government to not have a back to normal approach to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We will have a major chance.  That is why we are seeing responsibility for services going out of my Department.  I regret that, because I was passionate about it and delivered a significant increase in funding for Tusla in the last two budgets for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  I also recognise that there is a strong belief, particularly in the NGO sector, that it is better that everything is brought together under one Department, and particularly under the one agency that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is about to establish.  I believe that one agency that deals with the policies and also with the day-to-day implementation and service provision for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is the way forward.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Justice will address sentencing as part of the third national strategy.  We now have a Judicial Council, which issues guidelines.  That has to be linked with the training that the Citizens' Assembly recommended.  I do not agree with mandatory sentencing.  I think there is a risk with that in all aspects of life.  I agree with the Deputy that there are cases where one might ask, \"Really?\"  I feel that too.

I will ask my own questions, many of which flow from it.  Colleagues might wish to speak again on the second round.  Coming back to Deputy Cronin's point, we have explored, both today and in previous sessions, what our committee can bring with regard to recommendations 1 to 3, and what our role is in advising or recommending to the Government that the referendum be held.  We want this to be the last committee that looks at this.  We want to see a referendum in 2023, which we have all agreed as an aim of our committee.  We want to see how best we can assist Government in doing that.  We see our role as being somewhat like the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, chaired by former Senator, Catherine Noone, which delivered to Government a report on how to proceed with holding the referendum.<\/p> <p>  I take the Minister's point about not wishing to pre-empt the work of this committee.  We need to establish how we can best assist and support his Department and the Government to make a political decision on the holding of the referendum.  As others have said, we previously heard from officials, academics and NGOs about how the process would unfold.  This is our last session dealing with this module and these first three recommendations.  The committee will then need to decide in private what approach it wishes to take.  We have previously explored with stakeholders the issues of deletion and replacing the full Article 41.  The Minister has already highlighted that that would open up debates about, for example, divorce and reopening marriage equality.  The consensual view that we were presented with was that it would be better to go for a more minimalist approach, which is the approach that the assembly recommended.  In our previous session, we engaged closely with the detail of those three recommendations and how they could be most effectively brought forward to a referendum.<\/p> <p>  We would be happy to provide the Minister with an indication of our thinking once the committee has come together privately.  It would be great to get a response from the Department then.  That might address Deputy Cronin's point about how it would provide us with a timeframe, rather than us just coming forward on 3 December with a report that would then have to be considered.  We may want to engage informally with the Department prior to the finalising of our report.  That is probably the best way to proceed, if that is agreeable.<\/p> <p>  It is urgent that we do this, but we need to do it in a way that will achieve the passing of the referendum.  We are all cognisant of the political risks.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill said, we have discussed how best to achieve the holding of a referendum that will not throw up more problems and opposition than we might have predicted.<\/p><p> I have three focused questions which stray beyond recommendations 1 to 3, but which address issues the Minister raised in his opening statement.  The first is on the gender pay gap.  It is great to see the progress that has been made on that.  It is nice to know that this will tick recommendation 33 from the Citizens' Assembly which related to the Gender Pay Gap Information Act.  That is very welcome.  Will that address recommendation 32, which is setting the targets to reduce the hourly gender pay gaps?  The Minister may wish to refer back to the committee on that issue at a future date.  We will be considering pay and workplace conditions at a later date.  The Citizens' Assembly sought not only the implementation of the law but also the setting of targets by 2025 and again by 2035.<\/p><p> On childcare, the Minister detailed what progress is being made.  How will that link with recommendation 8 of the Citizens' Assembly on childcare?  Again, it is setting out a timeframe over the next decade to move to a publicly funded, accessible model of early years and out-of-hours childcare.  How does the work the Department is doing match that recommendation?  A key part of our work is looking at what work is already under way in government and how that can link with and deliver on the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.<\/p><p> The final matter is recommendation 42, which we will be considering later.  Again, the Minister may wish to refer back at a later date on this, but the assembly has recommended a statutory body for gender equality under the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister.  The committee needs to look at how best that may be implemented, but it would be great to know if there are any preliminary views from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#F00900","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I am open to informal engagement with the committee and with you, Chairman, on your interim recommendations on the constitutional point.  That would be very useful.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the mechanism for delivery of the narrowing and, it is to be hoped, eventual removal of the gender pay gap, the implementation of the legislation will be important in making clear what the issues are, what companies see as the reasons behind those issues and what those companies are doing to address them.  The first step is to get the core information and then we can look at what other measures are necessary to narrow it.  I had a useful engagement with the UK Minister for Women and Equalities when I was at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in New York.  She set out some new measures taking place in the UK.  When new positions are being advertised the company will put the rate of pay expected in the advertisement because the history when it comes to pay negotiations is that women do worse in them than men or, perhaps, pay being pitched to women and people from minority groups by the prospective employer is at a lower rate.  It is an interesting idea to have a requirement that the salary scale should be in the advertisement.  It is not something I had considered previously.  There is a range of issues that we can examine to deliver on narrowing that gap.<\/p> <p>  The third point was with respect to childcare and the goal of a publicly funded system.  The initiation of core funding is going to be a huge step towards that.  In a full year, that will be &euro;221 million.  That is an additional approximately &euro;110 million on the existing investment.  This year, we are putting &euro;710 million into childcare before any increases introduced in next year's budget.  Any additional spending will bring it to over &euro;800 million in 2023.  It is a significant advance in the quantum of money.  However, the key issue is that it is not just about public investment and public money, it is also about the public management of the system.  That is very important because this is not going to work if we do not have public management.  The key tool of public management is the fee freeze that we are asking for in exchange for this very significant investment in services.  The fee freeze is a first step towards the goal we all want, which is reduced fees for parents.  We get the fee freeze now and then in future budgets focus on broadening out the national childcare scheme, NCS, the direct subvention that parents get.  Of course, every additional euro we put into the national childcare scheme is bringing us more towards a fully publicly funded model.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the statutory body, I might refer back with a written response on that.  That is probably an area where we do not have detailed proposals at this stage.  There is a lot of recommendations here and a lot for my Department.

I am on three committees at present.  However, I heard Senator Ruane earlier, who got ahead of me and asked my question, which I know was discussed, about the mechanism for discussing wording and the policy in that regard.  Obviously, the Department has a strong role in policy, and the Department of Justice has done some of this work in the past.  I am aware the Minister is doing a review to see what the current position is.  Ultimately, however, similar to the conversation we had in our last meeting with the National Women's Council of Ireland, it is about the constitutional meaning of words.  Much of this is caught up in the advisory counsel part of the Attorney General's office and the specific individuals there who will ultimately assess any wording that is produced in draft form by either the Department or the committee.<\/p> <p>  It may expedite the matter, and I suggest this would be better done in private session, to bring in the relevant advisory counsel at the earliest stage to talk through the implications of the words that have already been used.  We talked about the word \"community\" at the last meeting.  There is an opportunity in Article 41 on the family for a simple deletion of \"based on marriage\".  What are the implications of that?  Are we prepared to go for that politically?  Probably, yes, but is that the simplest and most efficient way of achieving these different things?  There has to be a mechanism by which we can discuss the wording, because that is the conversation that is going to lead to it, with the advisory counsel side, in particular, and perhaps somebody from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, and to be able to have that discussion freely and openly to tease it out.  That is what is going to deliver the wording at the end.<\/p> <p>  We will be dependent on the Minister to be able to achieve that.  The committee can write and ask for it, but we would be dependent on the Minister's assistance to get it over the line and to be able to facilitate that type of dialogue, with officials or the Minister present if that were suitable.  We are talking about referendums next year, ideally.  The committee certainly is.  Of course, we do not have a wording so the Minister is talking about a potential or possible referendum, but that is the political objective from the committee's perspective.  The only way to get to that is to be able to tease out the wording in that practical way.  In my experience, and I have done this a few times, that is the most efficient thing to do - to be able at an early stage either to rule out words that just are not going to work or to know that we can play with them as part of what we are trying to do.  Would the Minister be open to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#G00400","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":851,"content":"<p>First, the Deputy is correct that there is a need for an element of teasing it out.  I am open to engaging either publicly or in private session, and I can make that commitment for officials in my Department.  I cannot make a commitment for the Office of the Attorney General.  It might be useful for the committee to write to that office and see if such a facility, in private session, would be open or available.  I can certainly see its benefits.  In terms of the strict written advice, there are very strong tenets regarding how legal advice from the Attorney General to the Government is treated.  I do not know whether there can be an engagement, perhaps an off-camera engagement, on the meaning of words.  From my perspective and the Department's perspective, we will be happy to engage with the committee in a more informal way on specific wording, particularly with the view of trying to get as wide political agreement as possible.  That is important to ensure the success of a referendum campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#G00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the matter of refuges for victims of domestic violence.  I know the Minister's Department does not have a capital budget to provide these refuge centres.  However, when we talk to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, he confirms that the responsibility to provide them lies with Tusla, which is under the Minister's Department.  We have specific obligations under the Istanbul Convention to provide adequate accommodation.<\/p><p>There are wraparound services that go with that including psychological care and, indeed, childcare because many of the women fleeing have children.  At present, we are not just meeting their needs.  So many counties do not have a refuge.  My county, Kildare, is split into two four-seat constituencies so it has a sizeable population but it has one centre in south Kildare.  I know from dealing with many women that they do not necessarily want to go to the local refuge in their county.  Sometimes they want to put a bit of distance between themselves and their abuser.  We need every county, nearly every constituency, to have a refuge.<\/p><p> We have been promised 60 new family places.  They are urgently needed.  What progress has been made on these 60 family units and what is the plan for the counties which do not have refuges now?  The intentions are good but we do not want them to be stymied if we do not know how they will be delivered and each Department is saying that it is not their job. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#G00600","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":854,"content":"<p>I want to acknowledge that the mechanisms for the delivery of new refuge spaces is not working fast enough.  Everybody recognises that.  The review undertaken by Tusla is the clearest evidence of that.  That review looked at two main metrics, namely population space per number of people in a particular area and access to refuge space by distance, in terms of a half hour journey.  That showed that there may be areas of the country where the population is low; if you have to travel more than half an hour to a refuge space, you are poorly served.  That review has identified parts of the country that are poorly served because there is a long distance to travel and some where the place may be close by but it is not enough because it is in a very built-up area.  For example, there is a refuge close by in Dublin 15 but there is not enough for the wider area and therefore it recommended a new one in Balbriggan in the Fingal area.<\/p> <p>  As it stands, Tusla is responsible for the current, that is day-to-day, expenditure on the annual upkeep, maintenance and running of refuges.  It is not responsible for the capital expenditure of new builds.  That is done through the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government through the capital acquisition scheme, CAS.  That is a good scheme but it is a lengthy scheme.   A domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, NGO that wants to open a new refuge in Dublin 15 or north Kildare must first be registered as an approved housing body, AHB.  Once it has gone through that process, it must go through all the steps.  Everyone recognises that that process is not working.  That is part of the work that is now being led by the Department of Justice in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government and my Department is there too around how we create a mechanism for swiftly delivering, first, the 60 refuge spaces which are most urgently needed but further refuges in the future too.  The Minister for Justice has called together an interdepartmental group which has been meeting regularly.  It will bring forward proposals which will be integrated into the third national strategy.  All responsibility for this will move towards the new DSGBV agency that will be under the Department of Justice.  There is work being undertaken on other refuges even while we are waiting for the new faster process to be introduced.   In particular, I know of work being undertaken in Louth, Laois and in Dublin around beginning to add that additional capacity.  The structures at the moment are working too slowly.  That is recognised.  We are replacing them in order to deliver on those 60 spaces that are so badly needed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022032400002#H00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1648080000,"counter":855,"content":"<p>Good.
