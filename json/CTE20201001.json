It is a great honour to be appointed as Chairman to this committee.  I look forward to working with all members in a genuine spirit of partnership and co-operation.  I welcome all members of the committee.  The Joint Committee on Health is and always has been one of the busiest committees in terms of its work programme and demands on members' time.  Much of our work will relate to how our health service copes with Covid-19.  The way we work as a committee will also be restricted by the protocols that are in place to protect members, staff and witnesses.  We will go through both the protocols and the development of the autumn programme in private session.  We are limited to a two-hour session and this means many issues will have to be addressed by way of written submissions in the first instance.  All I can do is commit that I will endeavour to be as fair and impartial as I can to all members of the committee.  I believe strongly that a united approach, wherein all members contribute and feel their efforts are worthwhile, will yield the best results.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the election of a Vice Chairman.  I ask that any nominations be sent to the clerk by Monday and a decision will be made by next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p> <p>  I propose we now go into private session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020100100002#B00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601506800,"counter":6,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 10.08 a.m. and adjourned at 11.09 a.m. until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 October 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
