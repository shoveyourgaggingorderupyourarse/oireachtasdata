The committee is meeting in public session to consider the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022.  We are joined by the following witnesses: Mica Action Group Donegal is represented by Mr. Michael Doherty, Dr. Andreas Leemann, Mr. Aidan Houton and Professor Paul Dunlop, who is joining us remotely; Clare Pyrite Action Group is represented by Dr. Martina Cleary and Dr. Michael Carmody; and Mayo Pyrite Action Group is represented by Ms Martina Hegarty and Ms Josephine Murphy.  We have received their opening statements and other submissions and I thank the witnesses for those.  They have been circulated to members.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meetings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The committee welcomes the opportunity to hear from the witnesses.  Our job as legislators is to ensure this Bill is fit for purpose and solves the terrible difficulties people have experienced with houses across more than the three counties represented here.<\/p> <p>  We are constrained by the fact that this is a two-hour session.  I ask witnesses to confine their opening statements to five minutes, after which we will move to the members.  There will be six minutes for each member to ask questions and for witnesses to answer.  I always ask members to keep questions direct and to the point to give witnesses the opportunity to respond because it is the witnesses we want to hear from.  If members agree to that, I think we will be able to fit everybody in.  We have the full membership present or represented and other members who have joined us may wish to contribute.  <\/p> <p>  We will hear first from he Donegal group, followed by the Clare group and then the Mayo group.

We have around 7,000 affected homes.  These primarily arose during the Celtic tiger years.  Self-regulation of manufacturers, together with inadequate local authority enforcement of standards, allowed unfit concrete blocks to enter the Irish market for years.  The regulations that should have protected consumers did not do so and homeowners were unknowingly exposed to defective products destined to fail on the biggest and most significant purchases of their lives.<\/p> <p>  In desperation, we chased the quarry owners, insurance companies and those that provide bonds on our homes.  We chased the banks for help.  No one would help us.  No one was interested.  We had no option but to chase the State that allowed this disaster to unfold, albeit unknowingly &ndash; or was it?  In 2014, we made the State aware of the issue with evidence submitted to Donegal County Council.  Minutes have been provided.  It took until 2020 for a scheme to arrive.  A so-called 90-10 scheme would end up akin to a 60-40 scheme, costing the average homeowner more than &euro;100,000 for demolition and rebuild.  That was if you could afford to access the scheme in the first place.  That scheme was correctly rejected.<\/p> <p>  A massive campaign saw over 20,000 people arrive on the streets of Dublin on 15 June and 8 October 2021.  Our demand was 100% redress, no less.  As a result, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, set up a working group over the summer months.  It was meant to facilitate a solution but instead saw the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage defend its old 90-10 scheme.  No progress was made because it was thwarted and stymied by the attitude and actions of the Department.  We soon realised we were seen less as victims and more as chancers or opportunists looking to get something for nothing.  All we wanted were our homes back on a like-for-like basis, only what we had already paid for.<\/p> <p>  That was not an unreasonable request, especially when we look at the nearest precedent available, namely, the pyrite remediation scheme, mainly in Leinster.  These homeowners were provided with true like-for-like replacement, including house finishes, end-to-end contract management by the State and zero cost to the homeowner.  Instead, we are offered a grant to fix our homes, leaving us to find contractors who will work to the grants provided, which are wholly inadequate.  The inflationary world we live in is all at the homeowner&rsquo;s exposure, none of it at the State&rsquo;s.<\/p> <p>  To further frustrate the process, the Department has red tape to the nth degree as regards terms and conditions and caps and exclusions which leave this scheme unworkable.  Members will hear them tell us that the rates are independent and fair, as they came through the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI.  The reality is that the SCSI was dictated to under the terms of reference, which create a significant difference between eligible costs and true costs.  This inhibits any chance of 100% redress.  Examples are 15-year-old standards leaving us to make up the differences and not even a carpet allowed for in the home by way of finish; no allowance for the replacement of foundations which are made of the same deleterious materials as are in the defective blocks; and no allowance for other defective block structures like walls and garages, all equally capable of killing members of our family as they subside and fall over time.  Real costs versus allowable costs at current rates represent more like an 80% grant.<\/p><p>This leaves homeowners out tens of thousands of euros - a shortfall we simply cannot afford. <\/p><p> To compensate, homeowners requested a penalty-free downsizing option that would allow the grant based on their current home size to be redirected to building themselves a smaller home for the money.  Instead, Government saw fit to hold back on the grant amount it was prepared to give and instead provide a grant against the smaller home, leaving the homeowner with the same problem and still out tens of thousands of euros, still trapped and unable to afford to rebuild.<\/p><p> The committee will hear of science today, or the lack of it, in the assessment and categorisation of our homes.  The IS 465 protocol has not allowed for the inclusion of other pertinent deleterious materials such as pyrrhotite.  It has not allowed for the testing of foundations that our experts will show is playing with fire and will ultimately cost the State more in the long run.  <\/p><p> We have excluded homes.  Many of our rental homes are not eligible.  Small buy-to-let landlords cannot afford to replace these homes and their tenants have nowhere to go.  Holiday and retirement homes, some inherited homes and homes occupied by vulnerable adults that are not classed as principal private residences are excluded from the scheme as it stands.  These are equally innocent victims of unfit products entering the market for years.  While they are not demanding they get pushed in front of others, they are rightly demanding that they are not excluded from the scheme.  Prioritisation, yes; exclusion, no.<\/p><p> We have identified 35 different issues in the general scheme, all of which to a greater or lesser extent render the scheme unworkable.  These are tabled in the submission.  Many of these were heavily debated and negotiated over the past six months between homeowner representatives and officials.  The negotiation was undertaken in good faith on the part of the homeowners and progress appeared to be made.  However, the Department continues to attempt to exert what can only be described as coercive control over the homeowners as opposed to seeking a solution-based approach.  Families are stressed to breaking point.  They have endured years of uncertainty and anxiety of every possible description.  The scheme should be a way out of this nightmare.  Instead, its inflexible, cynical, illogical and blinkered approach is burdening homeowners with yet more stress.  Where is the empathy from the State?  Why would the State not allow homeowners to downsize without penalty when it comes at no additional cost?  This is not 100% redress, despite what the State might claim.  Homeowners will be out tens of thousands of euros with some cases amounting to six-figure sums.  The caps are discriminatory and must be adjusted to take into account our current environment if not completely eliminated.<\/p><p> Ignoring the science is a cheap sticking-plaster solution that will drive homeowners through this nightmare not once but twice in their lifetime.  Innocent victims are abandoned under current exclusions and our demand is that ultimately no homeowner with a property including defective concrete blocks, DCB, should be left behind and we want that in writing.  We implore the committee to study the submissions and after today&rsquo;s scrutiny, forward recommendations to the Minister that address these key issues.  After ten years of heartache, allow us a path to restore our lives, a path to true 100% redress and no less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I am the founder of the Clare Pyrite Action Group.  My apologies for the late and altered opening statement.  After two years of arduous campaigning for inclusion in this scheme and only two working days to prepare for the meeting on behalf of County Clare, the committee may understand it was difficult to decide exactly what to say in five minutes.<\/p> <p>  I am an ordinary homeowner put in an extraordinary situation.  On 10 August 2020, I stood outside my modest bungalow in County Clare and listened to an engineer explain that there were suspected defective concrete blocks in my home.  It could be pyrite or mica and only core testing would tell.  The problem was serious and degenerative, and could not be repaired.  It was a serious structural defect that would only worsen over time and no assistance was available to me in County Clare.  Assistance was only available to homeowners in counties Mayo and Donegal.  It is impossible to fully explain the impact of getting this news to somebody who has not been on this journey.  It hits you in the gut.  It is a sickening, prolonged and toxic anxiety.  It involves sleepless nights and lying awake wondering how long you have and how much time before your home becomes dangerous.  The fear of your own home grows and becomes an almost obsessional routine of checking for evolving damage.  Your life changes as you become alienated from what used to be normal reality and the shadow of this is always present, disrupting your whole life, your family life and your community.<\/p> <p>  I will tell the eminent members of the committee that this problem my not yet be in their counties but it is coming.  We currently know of defective concrete blocks, or suspicions of same, in 12 counties along the western and eastern seaboards.  It is likely a problem in every county.  The decisions the committee comes to and the recommendations it makes will be instrumental in influencing how this crisis plays out among members' constituents, neighbours, friends and family.  They may have defective concrete blocks in their homes and do not realise it.  Do not let the situation play out elsewhere as it did in Donegal and Mayo.<\/p> <p>  Once I recovered from the initial shock of the discovery, next came the questions.  How could this happen?  How could the most fundamental, taken for granted, mundane thing, that is, a humble concrete block, be crumbling inside the walls of my house?  A concrete block should last for 100 years.  If we are to look at our built environment, houses are intact that were built decades ago.  As an academic and researcher, my default mode is to investigate and to find answers, if there are any.  Somebody had to be responsible; something had to be done; something had gone wrong somewhere.  That engineer admitted he had visited at least 40 to 50 houses with the same problem in the Clare-Limerick area.  However, beyond that he would say no more due to what he termed a conflict of interest.  This was my first but not my last encounter with what I describe as avoidance of the elephant in the room.  I was to encounter many such moments in the months that followed and due to the scale and influence of our main supplier in County Clare, CRH Roadstone, I would encounter several such conflicts of interest.<\/p> <p>  On 4 September 2020, I founded the Clare Pyrite Action Group with a membership of one.  I was inspired by what I learned of the action groups in Mayo and Donegal.  When you find yourself in this situation, you quickly realise that the ordinary homeowner has nowhere else to go.  In the first month, I tried to find help and advice from the local authority, the pyrite remediation board, local solicitors and local Deputies.  I even wrote to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I was passed from one office to the next and from one dead end to another.  The resounding response was that there is no pyrite in County Clare and no help was available.  I was alone.<\/p> <p>  However, within two months of setting up Clare Pyrite Action Group, I had been approached by 25 similarly impacted homeowners.  Within six months, that number had doubled.  Today, because of the research I have conducted on the ground among our membership, I am aware of 1,025 private homes with confirmed or suspected issues.  The homes impacted include homes on 17 private housing estates, five local authority housing estates and 11 public and private dwellings.  This is only the beginning.  There is most definitely pyrite in the concrete blocks of County Clare.<\/p> <p>  On 14 June 2022, the Government finally admitted that was the case and Clare was allowed access to the DCB grant scheme.  It was a milestone achievement for every person who has worked hard to secure this admission over the past two years.  It is a moment to acknowledge this accomplishment after the arduous and extraordinarily difficult process through which we have been put.  We have followed carefully all of the things that are happening and the response of the people in Mayo and Donegal to the issue and we are worried.  We had to watch from the sidelines because we were excluded from the working group negotiations and had no input to the terms and conditions of this new scheme.  Clare met the IS 465 qualification in July 2021 in the submission to the Department.  We met fully and rigorously the criteria that had qualified 150 homes in Mayo for the scheme.  I can only speculate, and forgive me if I am wrong, that this was a strategic and deliberate delaying strategy to ensure the interim conditions and new qualification criteria would be introduced to limit and prevent as many of us as possible from entering the scheme.  I point in that regard to the damage threshold, which is of particular concern to us.<\/p> <p>  The statements of the eminently qualified witnesses who will contribute to the follow-on panels this afternoon arrived around midnight last night.  As I read their biographies, I could not help but reflect on the extraordinary situation we are in today.  We, the ordinary homeowners, are facing the full power of the State, all of its resources and its ability to secure the most qualified and professional voices from the most established and respected bodies in the country.  They are all working on behalf of the State to ensure its position will be unquestionable and upheld.  It is impossible not to feel that we, the homeowners who are the victims, are on trial, and for what?  For daring to expect more?  For daring to demand more?  For expecting that the homes we have worked hard to pay for and continue to pay for should stay standing around us?<\/p><p>We expected oversight of regulation to ensure that the blocks used to build our homes would be sound and enforced.  We have been let down on so many levels, particularly by the State, which continues to fail in its duty to do right by its citizens, the ordinary workers and taxpayers of this country who are impacted by this issue.  That is us; the people sitting before the committee today.<\/p><p> I received a text message recently from an engineer who had been there on the first day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Cleary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Cleary to finish up as soon as possible.

Of particular importance to us, in County Clare, are four issues.  First, is the damage threshold, which we feel has been introduced to be deliberately prohibitive.  From the testing done on buildings, we know that it is only at the core testing stage that the science proves that even though the render may look fine, the blocks underneath are crumbling and rotting.  I have included some visual examples of that in my submission to the committee.  We are also worried about homeowner access to independent assessment and testing, which is crucial in determining the true gravity of the situation for homeowners.  There is a conflict of interest right across the system, from engineers to testing companies and other professionals.  We have encountered several difficulties along the way in ensuring there is an independence of testing regime.  We are also concerned about the remediation options for pyrite and reactive sulphate damage.  There is a sulphate attack in County Clare.  The option there is demolition.  That is what the experts are saying.  We cannot continue to retain pyrite blocks in the buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Cleary"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Cleary to finish up there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#C00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The final issue is resourcing and funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Cleary"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Hegarty to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#C00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>My home was built using defective concrete blocks.  I am joined today by Ms Josephine Murphy, who is also impacted by the issue; and online by Mr. Thomas Campbell, a chartered engineer who has been supporting homeowners in counties Mayo and Donegal through this nightmare.  We are here today because we must provide the opportunity to the people of County Mayo to finally move forward with their lives and rebuild their homes.  We want to feel happy in our homes again.  We want the scheme up and running.  Over the next three weeks the Oireachtas will play a key role in deciding our future.  We need its support in ensuring the Bill is not passed until it is fit for purpose and provides all supports necessary to homeowners to rebuild their homes.  Today we welcome the opportunity to address the fundamental flaws that exist within the legislation and the scheme in general on behalf of the people of County Mayo.<\/p> <p>  As homeowners, we are acutely aware of the damage that is in our homes.  There is no escape from the daily mental stress of monitoring the expansion of cracks, the appearance of new cracks and the constant worry about how we are going to be able to afford to rebuild our homes.  We are extremely concerned about what lies underneath our homes.  Many homeowners are reporting cracking floors and jamming doors, which indicate either issues with the foundations or possible pyrite heave, similar to that experienced by homeowners in Dublin.  Many homeowners in County Mayo are very nervous about the introduction of a damage threshold.  While we accept that every home entering the scheme must have damage, it is unacceptable to block homeowners from entering the scheme by introducing a damage threshold.  It creates another layer of stress, as well as additional paperwork and fees, for homeowners, some of whom have been waiting up to ten years for the delivery of an effective scheme.  As homeowners, we know what is needed to rebuild our homes.  Over the last two years the committee has listened to our demands for 100% redress.  It is not a sound bite.  It is what it will take to rebuild our homes.  A total of six homes have been rebuilt in County Mayo to date.  We welcome the fact that those homeowners will benefit from any changes to the scheme.  However, those who had no choice but to remediate before the scheme commenced have been left behind.<\/p> <p>  On 3 March this year, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, published rates that were supposed to reflect the true cost of our rebuilds, but the resulting figures were tarnished due to restrictive terms and conditions set out by the Government.  The terms of reference dictated four estate-type homes and four rural-type homes, each increasing in size.  The SCSI was asked to generate figures based on 2007 building regulations.  The cost to employ an engineer to generate all of the paperwork necessary rebuild our homes - of up to &euro;15,000 - was requested to be ignored.  Smaller homes cannot carry the weight of these costs on a square foot rate.  Boundary walls, which are a threat to the health and safety of our children, were excluded.  There are others limitations which I have included in the briefing document.  The SCSI is not at fault here.  It completed the task with one hand tied behind its back.  Since the publication of the rates, we have seen inflation rise to more than 9%, but the square foot rate of &euro;161 on offer by the Government today will not rebuild my home.  My home will be one of the smallest to enter the scheme.  However, based on high-level quotes received to date, I may be up to &euro;50,000 short of the cost to rebuild my home.  We were promised that the scheme would be like for like, but no money is on offer to replace the finishes I have in my home.  I have worked hard to make my house a home.  It is not a like-for-like scheme.  It is disingenuous to suggest that it is, just as it is false to inform the general public that we are receiving 100% redress.<\/p> <p>  As homeowners, we are being restricted by not one but two caps.  The current upper grant cap is &euro;420,000.  Removing the allowance for rent, storage, and possible emergency costs, we are left with &euro;395,000.  The cap forces 33% of our homeowners into even more debt.  It leaves them unable to send their children to college or unable to rebuild a granny flat for their parents.  Homeowners will not be able to draw down a top-up or second mortgage as their homes are currently worthless, while many are still repaying their first mortgage.  We proposed a workable solution, namely, allowing homeowners to downsize their home but receive the cost of their current footprint.  Unfortunately, it was rejected by the Government.  It is the only solution that provides a true pathway for homeowners to receive 100% redress.  There are multiple benefits to the homeowner and the State in this approach.  It enables the elderly, those planning for retirement and vulnerable adults who are living in the counties with the lowest disposable income in the country to rebuild their homes.<\/p> <p>  Our request to the committee today is to enable us to get on with it.  We ask that we are provided with what we need to rebuild our homes.  As homeowners, we have been placed in one of the most stressful situations of our lives.  We want to escape this mental anguish.  We did not create the issue, yet we are being asked to pay for it.  Over the last ten years we have been actively campaigning for the scheme.  We are not in this alone.  There are now 12 other counties with us.  This is a second attempt to deliver a workable scheme.  We are not asking for compensation.  We are not asking for anything extra but to be able to rebuild our homes.  We need to get it right this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will open the questioning to members.

From a County Clare perspective, it has been very frustrating.  Whereas people from  counties Donegal and Mayo have had more than two years of at least informal negotiation with the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage and officials, the first negotiation with residents of County Clare took place on Monday of last week.  Earlier, Dr. Martina Cleary was restricted to a time limit of six minutes in delivering her opening statement.  I respect the fact that there are time constraints at committee meetings, but it is wrong for the issue to be condensed into six minutes, given the extent of the problem County Clare and length of the campaign to get here, which has been a two-year journey.  Cracks and crumbling blocks are just a physical manifestation of the problem.  The damage that has been done to the county and to the mental health of many homeowners is extensive.  My colleagues and I can account for the fact that the health of homeowners has deteriorated significantly over the past year and a half, as they have faced the unknown.<\/p> <p>  I will get straight to the questions.  I.S. 465:2018 is the benchmark test for getting one onto a redress scheme.  Over the past 12 months in County Clare we have seen that there are flaws within the testing model itself.  Five samples that Dr. Clearly, Mr. Simon Beale and I believed to confirm the presence of pyrite were sent off to a laboratory in England.  Weeks later the result came back stating that there was insufficient proof.  It struck me that samples were being taken from walls on the good side of a house.<\/p><p>To use a medical analogy, it was akin to checking a patient for a suspected brain tumour but taking a tissue sample from the big toe.  They were taking the sample from the opposite end, not getting the crumbling bag of dust that they wanted and they said there was no pyrite present.  Are the witnesses worried that if we stick with the current IS 465 testing of core samples, we will end up with more houses not getting near the damage threshold or any entry threshold whatever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#C00900","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>To correct the Deputy, the results that came back met the IS 465 criteria with exactly the same measurements, analysis and rigour that had already qualified Mayo with at least 150 houses.  We specifically chose our consultant engineer because he was one of the most experienced in the country.  We chose Petrolab as one of the most independent labs available.  They came back and everybody was puzzled as to why the Department asked for additional criteria and testing.  It stated very clearly that the analysis regime had already been met.<\/p> <p>  What we worry about is that they were changing the regime.  With Clare County Council they made us go through extraordinary measures to find this causative link between pyrite in the block, oxidation and damage, which was producing gypsum and secondary minerals like thaumasite, a sulphate attack that is far more problematic.  I am sure Dr. Andreas Leemann will be able to speak about that as well.  It is not just pyrite we have but a secondary sulphate attack.  Sulphate levels in the blocks in County Clare are far above regulation standards.<\/p> <p>  They are changing the IS 465 standards behind the scenes but what we are primarily worried about is what is worded from the working group, which is that the minimum damage is now 1.5 mm for group 2 listings.  There is already an assessment regime in place and it has been working perfectly well, supervised by IS 465 engineers.  They are prepared to sign off on that.  However, the new group 2 is very different.  The original group comprised cracking on one elevation.  We often see that with the damage we see in Clare.  Not all the cracks are 1.5 mm across.

It has been a long hard road.  The fact that the Clare Pyrite Action Group has been locked out of informal discussions is disappointing.  There is a different view to this because of the different dynamics in Clare and the impact of pyrite on houses.  For those reasons, the damage threshold is an issue for pyrite homes.  Dr. Cleary has elaborated a bit on that, but I will give her an opportunity to elaborate further.  Will she elaborate further on the deep issues?  Evidently, a visual inspection will not be enough.  The core testing that was done on various homes in Clare proved, without any shadow of a doubt, that the homes had pyrite; that it was very damaging and that the integrity of the block was crumbling, even more so than if it was a mica home.

Cracks appeared in the block in approximately 1997.  A few years later, this progressed to mould contamination, the most concerning of which is black mould.  I am representing evidence of health defects on family members.  We have had worsening cases of underlying asthma, rhinitis and fatigue.  These symptoms will only occur in my brothers when they are staying in the home.  I am also speaking today as a medical doctor to convey the health risks associated with black mould, which is affecting the interior of defective-block-affected homes at all levels of degradation.<\/p> <p>  Mould hitchhikes its way into a home.  A black mould requires a continuous water supply to sustain it.  It is contaminating the structural materials, which will need to be removed.  Black mould is mould that produces mycotoxins.  Mycotoxins are compounds that can be inhaled, ingested or transmitted via the skin and are small enough to penetrate human cell membranes and cross the human placenta and blood-brain barrier.  They can inhibit protein synthesis and disrupt immune function.  These actions are associated with disease causation, as well as exacerbation of existing disease.<\/p> <p>  Evidence can be supplied, as needed, for the associations that are shown in scientific literature between black mould and illness.  Strong associations exist between exposure and the worsening of lung conditions such as asthma, which affects one in 13 people in Ireland, the causation of asthma and the higher medical risk to the immunocompromised person.  Black mould is reported to impact or cause decline in cognitive function, a worsening of autoimmune conditions, mental health conditions, chronic fatigue and cancer.  Some people are more genetically prone to the more severe mycotoxin-associated illnesses.  The severity of illness is associated with duration of exposure.<\/p> <p>  Treatment of mycotoxin-induced illness often requires medication, including steroids and other immunosuppressants, which carry their own risks.  N95 masks are recommended at an industrial level for workers exposed to mould.  The Health and Safety Authority, the European Union, the World Health Organization and the Centres for Disease Control give a guidance on mould and black-mould contamination, to include some of the associated health risks.

My colleague in Dublin, Senator Boyhan, and I are together in this.  I am a building contractor and a blocklayer.  I understand everything the witnesses are saying, but I will tell them why the core testing has to go ahead.  The Government is now pushing a retrofit grant that is going out throughout the country.  The grant is to insulate one's house.  If one insulates a house with pyrite, it accelerates what is happening.  We had 30 people here yesterday from Limerick who have pyrite in their houses and have formed a group.  I get two or three phone calls per week from people, because I am a building contractor, to ask me to come to look at their houses and see what are the criteria.<\/p> <p>  When this first happened, people rang us and asked what they would do.  I said to people to seal it up, until somebody got to them, because we did not know what was coming.  We did not know what grant aid would be available to people and we told them to seal up the cracks to stop the water getting in, because of the pyrite issue.  What has been proven in terms of people who had poor insulation in their houses, such as those houses built in the 1980s which would only have had 40 mm white insulation, is that of the houses that had pyrite and had insulation pumped into their cavities, 90% of them are showing up with pyrite in our country because insulation accelerates what is happening.<\/p> <p>  If the Government does not allow the core testing to go ahead to make sure there is not pyrite in the houses we are insulating, it is causing a bigger problem in the whole country, because it will accelerate a situation of which it has control.  Core testing has to stay there.  The lack of engineers we have to test this is also a big problem.  The engineers that engineered people's houses on the first day, who were taking the certified blocks and stones were good enough at the time for the banks, institutions and the Government, to meet regulations when they were building their houses.  They were good enough to sign off on people's houses and now they are saying they are not good enough to do testing or even be part of testing, or to do core testing and send it to an independent lab in order for us to get fast-tracked results.<\/p><p> On one hand, the Government is looking to insulate houses, which can accelerate the damage caused by pyrite, and, on the other, it is stopping coring to find out if homes have pyrite from going ahead.  All the blocks I am talking about came from Clare, which borders Limerick.  The problem lies with the quarries used at the time.  Some houses have the Clare blocks and some have the Clare infill, that is, pyrite is not in their blocks but in their floors and bursting up through the floors.  Some houses have it around the outside, where clause 804 was laid in order to put in the sewers and so on, which is causing the footpaths to burst up.  People wonder what is wrong and whether the ground has subsided.  It has not.  It is the pyrite.  The question comes back to the witnesses, and they have answered it a couple of times already.  What is their thinking on pumped insulation going into houses that could have pyrite?  In any of their cases, has that accelerated the process of pyrite showing out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#E01400","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I can answer that for the Deputy.

The problem now, however, is that when the winter comes again, the moisture will build up inside that and the whole lot will come off in a leaf.  The problem you have when you build a house is that you have a wall plate that holds up your roof and, if you have a hip roof, you are putting the pressure onto the corners of your house.  If you have a bungalow with an A-frame roof, it is all held together with triangulation of timber.  If one of your cavities is weakened by pyrite, your house will come down around you.

The idea of the action being taken by some homeowners at the moment, which is a type of class action, is that it is geared to recover from the State, through the courts, the difference between the grant that is allocated and the true cost of replacing one's home.  For example, if the grant is at &euro;160,000 but the true cost of replacement is &euro;200,000, the class action we are looking at is to recover the &euro;40,000, not the entire amount of money because we are not looking to get the grant paid out twice.

In the example I gave, it looks like rather than the &euro;40,000 shortfall going to the homeowner to make up the difference, which is the reason it was designed, it would be recovered by the State against the &euro;160,000 it paid out in a grant.

Somebody put it well earlier in saying the SCSI had one hand tied behind its back.  It was given parameters and could not price for foundations or the current regulations.  It could not even include in its square-foot rate floor coverings, such as a simple carpet or laminate flooring.  I looked at a 2,500 sq. ft. house, for which the SCSI had a rate of &euro;147 per square foot.  I allowed for an inflation rate of 9%, which is a conservative estimate given the volatility in the price of materials, as builders will know.  Every second week, people are getting an email indicating that the prices of materials are increasing.  For example, last week I received an email stating that the price of insulation will go up by between 20% and 25% on 1 July.  I added 9% to account for inflation to the rate of &euro;147 per square foot set by the SCSI for a standard four-bedroom house, one of the most common house types in Donegal.  I then worked out it would cost approximately &euro;10,000 to take out foundations, dispose of the materials and put in new foundations.  This worked out at approximately &euro;4 per square foot.  Building to the current regulations adds approximately &euro;11 per square foot.  Including floor coverings, whether tiling, laminate, carpet or whatever else, would add a further &euro;5 per square foot, giving &euro;147, plus &euro;13 per square foot to account for inflation, &euro;4 per square foot to account for foundations, &euro;11 per square foot to cover the current regulations and approximately &euro;5 per square foot for floor coverings, it amounts to &euro;180 per square foot.  That is what it will cost to complete a 2,500 sq. ft. house from start to finish under current regulations.<\/p> <p>  The other parameter I ask the committee to consider is in regard to smaller houses.  There are items that will cost the same amount regardless of house size, whether it is 2,500 sq. ft., 2,000 sq. ft. or 1,500 sq. ft.  These include kitchens, stairs, fees and connecting and disconnecting electricity.  The final amount was approximately &euro;50,000.  Divided by 2,500, that works out at &euro;20 per square foot over a 2,500 sq. ft. house, &euro;50 per square foot for 1,000 sq. ft. house.  There is a &euro;30 per square foot difference between a small house and a bigger house.  It will be &euro;180 per square foot for a 2,500 sq. ft. house but for a 1,000 sq. ft. house, it will be approximately &euro;210 per square foot for the same specification with a smaller size.

Ms Hegarty and I have been working closely with some of the officials and much of what we understood would happen did not materialise last Tuesday.  All I can tell the Deputy is what we were led to believe, which was that there will be a one-stop shop, a seamless process that will include the grants from the SEAI where a homeowner decided to seek them.  That is our understanding of that.<\/p> <p>  On the costs, it is important to understand the reasons for the differences exist between what SCSI put together and what Mr. Houton sees as our prices on the ground.  These can be summarised under two headings.  One is that the terms of reference given to the SCSI deliberately excluded true costs and the Department decided what the eligible costs were.  A figure of &euro;15,000 in professional fees that a homeowner has to pay is not included.  The cost of foundations has been left out.  The Department is expecting us, on a leap of faith and without the science, to say the foundations are okay.  Most homeowners want to change their foundations and will pay for that themselves.  That will cost another &euro;10,000.  No finishes of any kind are provided for, not even a basic carpet.  We know what it takes to finish a house.  It will cost another &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 and the homeowner has to find that.<\/p><p>There are also boundary walls and garages.  You cannot be in your new house and have your children running around in the street when walls and garages have the potential to fall down over time.  These are costs that the homeowner will bear.  People could very quickly spend &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 on these things but they cannot access that money.  That is why we want an option for downsizing.  We should not deprive people of the chance to take the grant, to take the hit on the equity in the house they already bought and paid for and to liquidate part of it to spend on building a smaller house they can afford.  It would be criminal of the State to block that.  That is what we are facing.  If the committee is to recommend anything, it should be that people who are prepared to take the hit on the size of the home they already bought and paid for should not be deprived of a second chance to avoid going near banks and to pay for a house out of their grants, as they wish to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Leemann for travelling here from Switzerland today.

I will quickly say something about the role of pyrrhotite in the concrete blocks from Donegal.  Pyrrhotite is the unstable form of iron sulphate.  It oxidises, which results in a first phase of expansion.  This is relatively small.  It is the rust that is formed from the iron.  Sulphur is then released, which leads the concrete blocks to expand due to the formation of a new minerals.  The first is called ettringite and then, in the second stage, another sulphate mineral that leads to the loss of the concrete's strength, thaumasite, is formed.  At a given point, carbonation, that is to say the concrete taking in CO2 from the air, kicks in.  This boosts the formation of thaumasite, which means a loss of strength.  In the end, these two new mineral phases, ettringite and thaumasite, disappear because gypsum is formed.  This is the end stage.  With regard to the standards and the levels of sulphur that are allowed in aggregates, Professor Dunlop has looked into this question and can comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andreas Leemann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>As a professional researcher at Ulster University, I was very concerned about the lack of research into this issue so I brought a team of people together.  Dr. Leemann is one of these and another is Mr. Nick Scaglione from the USA.  We have looked at the concrete issue independently without being restricted to the IS 465 protocols.  We presented our research at the European Parliament on 23 March.  We invited Engineers Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and people from the Department to join us and to look at the findings.  It is absolutely clear from the research we have done that pyrrhotite is oxidising and releasing sulphur, which is turning into sulphuric acid and attacking the cement hydrates.  We have found the process connected to the cracking of concrete blocks in Donegal.  It is a real thing and cannot be ignored.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Doherty has already said that many of these homes were built during the Celtic tiger years.  The regulations that were in place at that time, the European standards on aggregates for concrete, EN 12620:2002, specified very clearly that, if pyrrhotite is present in the aggregate, then 0.1% of sulphur can be released, which is a very low level.  That was published by the NSAI in 2004.  Its regulation was called SR 16:2004 and used the exact same wording.  The NSAI updated that standard in 2008 which was then called IS EN 12620:2002+A1:2008.  I know that is quite a long title but I mention it for the record.  This standard said the same thing, that special attention must be given to aggregates that contain pyrrhotite and that you cannot have more than 0.1% sulphur being released into concrete. <br\/><br\/>Analysis that we have done with Dr. Leemann and Mr. Scaglione has clearly identified that in areas where there is this cracking, you find pyrrhotite being oxidised and sulphur being released.  Dr. Leemann presented really good results that show sulphur being released <i>in situ<\/i>in the blocks in Donegal today.  We have also shown the process whereby these secondary minerals, ettringite and thaumasite, form and expand, causing cracking.

This would have been done during construction to get to a suitable bearing capacity whereby one had to excavate deeper to get to a solid area.  Under the current scheme, that excessive amount of blockwork needs to be removed, replaced and built on the existing strip foundation.  There are a number of practical issues with that from a construction point of view and a health and safety point of view.  If it is the case that the house is in a housing estate there would be quite a deep excavation required adjacent to the public footpath and to the other properties.  If it is a house in the countryside there could be excess costs around landscaping where one must take it back and dig a deeper hole.  A very practical solution to this is to remove the defective blockwork, remove the infill hardcore that is there, replace the hardcore in compacted layers and then create a reinforced concrete raft up closer to ground level where one has poor ground conditions.  This is what the designs do and it is a very practical solution.. By today's standards, where there is excessive blockwork below that is greater than 900 mm, and the infill stone is greater than 900 mm, one is required to put in a precast concrete slab at floor level to span between the blockwork.  This is to carry the house and carry the floors because hardcore greater than 900 mm is susceptible to settlement.  From a cost point of view, doing a reinforced concrete raft versus the blockwork and a precast slab would probably work out cost neutral but it is very much a more robust and practical solution from a construction and building point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Campbell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#J00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>My understanding from reading the expert group report is that it is two citations, which are a book and a journal that are out of date and off topic.

That is the cost, roughly, to build a house.  So, a 2,000 sq. ft house would cost some &euro;360,000 plus VAT.  The VAT on that house would be &euro;48,600.  That VAT is the first thing the Government could waive, which might bring us back into a slight part of redress.  The percentage rate that we are missing is the VAT.  If anyone who has pyrite in their house could remove the VAT this would be &euro;48,000 that would bring us closer to getting where the costings are.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the building process, I will just start with a house that has pyrite at the moment.  If I come in the front gate I may see that there is a tarmac drive, if the house is lucky enough to have one.  If the house must be taken down then the sewerage sytem and the footpath and everything around the house will be impacted because it will involve going down to the foundation level.  This means all of the sewerage system being taken up.  The &euro;180 per sq. ft does not cover all the external works.  It is just to the builder's finish.  It does not include a kitchen, curtains, paint, or reinstatement of bathroom tiles.  It comes up well short of the costings being given at the moment.  To remove all the rubble from the site it now must go to licensed tips.  One might not have a licensed tip near enough to the area so there will also be a transport cost of getting that material from the household to a licensed tip.  This also adds another cost.  When one works this out, it could be an extra &euro;30 per sq. ft more by the time all of the remedial works around the house are done such as reinstating lawns.  It is not a small job to take out the material that must be taken out.  The Government has not looked at this and the costings have not been looked at.  If the Government wants to come closer to the costs - and we have Government people here and they all want to help - then 13.5% VAT on a 2,000 sq. ft house is &euro;48,600.  This figure should be added into the redress scheme, 100% straight away.

I would like to bring Mr. Leemann into the discussion as well.  The main issue we are worried about in Donegal is not so much pyrite as pyrrhotite, which is another form of unstable iron sulphite.  It is more highly reactive than pyrite and it is well known internationally, in the United States - in Massachusetts and Connecticut - and also in Quebec in Canada.  Mr. Leemann has presented work that he has done in Switzerland where very high-strength concrete used in foundations and megastructures like dams fails because of oxidisation of pyrrhotite.<\/p> <p>  To date, from what I can see publicly, Engineers Ireland has been fairly quiet, but I heard its representatives speak on the radio.  Dr. Martina Cleary organised an excellent conference a few weeks ago.  All I can say at the moment is that there is a denial of the problem in Donegal that pyrrhotite is widespread.  Mr. Campbell can speak about this as well.  Some 86% of the homes in Donegal that he has sampled have appreciable levels of pyrrhotite in them.  It is a major issue.  People from Engineers Ireland or the NSAI, who are wedded to this old idea that mica is a problem in Donegal need to shift.  There is a serious pyrrhotite issue.  Pyrrhotite is classed as a geohazard.  Other types of geohazards are hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis.  This is a real problem.  I accept we need more research to try to understand it, but evidence is there to show that it is a widespread issue.  I will hand over to Mr. Leemann, who may have other comments to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Paul Dunlop"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Before he does, I wish to ask Professor Dunlop one more question.

That is what downsizing offers, should a homeowner decide to go that way, as long as there is not a penalty, such as they are trying to impose at the moment.  That is number one.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that when it comes to the inconvenience factor, there have been conversations already around not having to go through planning, so long as one is working off the same footprint of the home.  Even if the footprint was shortened somewhat to make it a smaller home, they would largely be on the same plot as they were before and exemptions in that regard are being explored.  With a bit of creativity, we could make all that work, and we would not have the level of inconvenience that a homeowner may have to put up with, but the starter for ten is that we need a way to get a home rebuilt when people do not have the &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 to bridge the shortfall.

It took us by surprise.  We had a 61-page document to go through.  It was Thursday of last week before we got all our issues discovered, raised and tabled.  This is very recent - less than a week.  It is quite a complex issue when it becomes legal.  We have sought legal advice on it and we are still awaiting that legal advice.  So far, we have been led to believe that at a high level this is something to put the frighteners on people chasing any claim from anybody.  We are sorry to see that part.<\/p> <p>  There has always been talk about chasing the perpetrators but it has never found its way on to anything in black and white that we have seen.  If it has, it has certainly not been pursued with any vigour.  In the document again the homeowner is the easiest port of call.  The homeowner seems to be the target as opposed to the quarries that allowed it or as opposed to the local authorities and their failure to regulate the standards that would have avoided this disaster in the first place.<\/p> <p>  As homeowners, we feel victimised.  We feel that we are an easy target.  The bigger businesses, banks and insurance companies are not being pursued with any vigour as far as we can see.  In black and white in the general scheme, there we are, named again.  It contains language such as jail sentences of five years and fines of &euro;50,000 for anything deemed fraudulent.  All the language we are seeing here is pointing to homeowners and how to manage these people who seem to be looking for something for nothing.

We have suggested 35 different amendments in our submission.  To catch the essence of it, we had three pillars from the beginning.  The first relates to cost: 100% redress and no less.  The scheme has a cap of &euro;420,000.  When the scheme was announced at the end of November last year, that cap affected 18% of our homeowners.  Because of inflation, it now affects one third of our homeowners.  That cap needs to go to &euro;460,000 to stay where were at the end of November with 18% affected.  If the cap is raised to &euro;460,000 at least we are back to where we were at the end of November and 18% of our people will need to suffer a cap over and above the square-foot cap.  There is one starting point.<\/p> <p>  The second one is the need for penalty-free downsizing.  We cannot penalise people who are taking the grant available and trying to make the most of it to build a smaller home.  That is just morally wrong.  The third thing relates to the rates.  The rates need to be solid.  The rates need to be reviewed before we launch the scheme.  We cannot launch a scheme that will hit the ground in months with figures that go back to February 2021.  They need to be reviewed and up to date.  A number to allow for inflation needs to be applied to that because otherwise our rates will be in arrears for the next 12 months and the homeowner carries that cost.  Those are the cost issues in pillar 1.<\/p> <p>  Pillar 2 relates to the science.  We have scientists and geologists here.  We have a compelling case that says we have missed the elephant in the room.  The elephant in the room is a deleterious material that is not even referenced in IS 465, called pyrrhotite.<\/p><p>It should have been referenced because there is a 2004 European standard that ought to have been included by NSAI and was not.   We are suffering the consequences on the back of that.  We are in a stand-off between the Department and the local authority in Donegal, where 369 applications are stalled because they do not know how to deal with pyrrhotite as IS 465 filters out everything bar pyrite and mica.  That stand-off is still to be resolved and it has been running since January.  We are six months into it.  We need to be in a place where we can say \"if in doubt take it out\".  I have no issue, nor has any homeowner, with NSAI doing what it needs to do to understand the science.  If we have a policy of \"if in doubt take it out\" and there is science that removes that doubt, we have no problem with moving to a place the science says is safe to move to, but we cannot put the cart before the horse.  We cannot ask homeowners to go through this twice in their lifetime with the risk of the unknown.  The unknown has not yet been clarified.  The Department's position is that it will have a go and if it does not work we will have a second bite because that is what the 40-year guarantee and the second grant is for.  That does not deal with the mental aspects of a homeowner going through this twice.  Pillar 2 is all about the science.  We need to get the science right and then the 40-year State-backed guarantee is in case some other unknown evolves over time due to new learning.  That is fine.  We understand that.<\/p><p> A point was made earlier about the scheme evolving.  There is a lot of learning at this point in time.  The Department and the Government have a lot of information.  We do not need three or four bites of this.  We had a bite of it in the 90:10 scheme from January 2020.  This is the enhanced scheme announced at the end of November.  We have told the Government and officials what needs to happen to make this work.  We do not need two or three more bites of this.  We can do this right this time if the will is there to do it.  If there is further learning down the road, we will take that when we need it but let us not make excuses for not doing the right thing now by saying this scheme can evolve.  Let us take what we know, what needs to be done, and do it this time.<\/p><p> Pillar 3 is about excluded homes.  There are other people who will not avail of this grant but they are equally victims.  They paid for their homes and they are being excluded.  There are people in second and third rentals.  At the minute, the principal private residence is covered, as well as the first rental property.  If people happen to have a second or third rental property, which some did for investments for the future or for pension funds, they are not eligible.  We have nowhere for the families in those homes to go, not to talk about the fact the landlord is out because of it.  What does he do with the second or third property?  There are homeowners who bought and invested and have been part of the Mayo, Donegal or Clare landscape but are being excluded.  These people bought in good faith and the Government is not looking to include them in any shape or form.  These people are not saying they should be pushed to the front.  They are just asking not to be left behind.  If there is a revision in three years, which is being talked about, we need language in place now stating that no defective concrete block home will be left behind.  For these people, it is not a case of not ever but just not today.  They will take that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations, not just for the information but the very reasonable and measured way they have brought that to the committee.

Given everything he knows about the kinds of deleterious materials that are in these counties, what does he think when he hears of options for just the outer leaf and not the inner leaf, or the brickwork but not the foundations?  The source of the aggregate might be the same or similar for the brick and the foundations.  Does he think these are credible options, based on his knowledge of the science?<\/p> <p>  We have moved away from talking about pyrite and mica exclusively to a range of other deleterious materials.  Based on Mr. Campbell's understanding and the information that is out there, what is the level of prevalence of these materials in any of the affected counties that he has knowledge of?<\/p> <p>  The way this legislation is set up, the first review of the unit cost the Minister can do is 12 months after the introduction of the legislation.  The legislation is due to be commenced in late autumn or early winter of this year.  It would therefore be late autumn or early winter 2023 before the Minister would be allowed to revise the base rates upwards.  Given what Mr. Houton knows in general about cost price inflation, and given that the original base rate was set early this year, where does he think costs will be two years after that original SCSI report?

You cannot transfer the data or knowledge gained from the blocks to the foundations because the ratio between aggregate and cement content changes for foundations.  There is a certain buffer of blocks to take some of the sulphur.  However, it goes off stronger in blocks because there is more cement, and you can form more expansive ettringite and more thaumasite, which leads to strength loss.  In principle, if it is in the concrete, pyrrhotite oxidation cannot be avoided.

My name is Paul Forde and I am director and chairman of DBFL Consulting Engineers.  Last January, I was appointed by the Department to chair the expert group on the enhanced defective concrete block scheme.  The expert group created three working groups.  I am happy to be here today with my colleague Mr. Martin Lynch, who is general manager of the pyrite remediation scheme and who chaired one of these groups.  We thank the committee for inviting us to assist in its discussions and deliberations on the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  I have been in practice as a consulting engineer for more than 42 years and I am a founding partner of DBFL Consulting Engineers.  The committee has been furnished with my qualifications and professional memberships, among which are fellow of Engineers Ireland and fellow of the Institute of Structural Engineers.  I have 14 years of extensive experience in investigating and resolving pyrite problems in a wide range of buildings.  I have acted as an expert witness on several occasions.  I was appointed as a member of the original Pyrite Resolution Board.  I chaired the technical committee that drafted IS 398-2.  Of particular relevance is the fact that this part of the standard dealt with the methodology for remediation works.  In 2013, Engineers Ireland appointed me to act as chair of its original assessment panel in respect of its pyrite register.<\/p> <p>  In January 2022 I was asked by the Minister to chair the expert group to advise on the proposed enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  The expert group was established to consider and advise the Minister on the technical issues that needed to be resolved.  These included issues such as the damage threshold for entry to the scheme, the parameters around the second grant application, an independent appeals process, a review of the certificate of remediation and consideration of the rebuild cost prepared by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.<\/p><p> The expert group met for the first time on 27 January 2022 and delivered its report on 16 March.  As I said earlier, the expert group created three working groups.  The first working group, which was chaired by Martin Lynch, dealt with the damage threshold and the building condition assessment reports.  The second, which was chaired by John O'Connor, dealt with the proposal to provide for a second grant to cover the possibility of future damage and to deal with the independent appeals process.  The third, which I chaired, dealt with the certification of remediation works carried under the proposed enhanced scheme.<\/p><p> In early March, John O'Connor and I met with representatives of the Mayo and Donegal homeowners - Martina Hegarty and Michael Doherty -  and discussed the terms of reference of the expert group.  We met again on 9 March during which the homeowners' views on all relevant issues were discussed.  At each meeting, we were very impressed by their representation, as, I am sure, the committee was earlier, and understood their concerns.<\/p><p> At the outset, the Minister emphasised that other longer-term technical issues required further investigation.  These included matters such as a review by the NSAI of I.S. 465, which deals with buildings damaged by deleterious materials, and a review of the Irish standards in respect of concrete blocks, including aggregates.  The NSAI has also been requested to examine and test foundations and to report back to the Minister.  The expert group produced two reports relating to short-term technical issues in respect of which the Minister required immediate recommendations.  These were the report on the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme dated 16 March 2022 followed by an addendum report in respect of the SCSI rebuild costs dated 29 April 2022.  The expert group's recommendations for the Minister's consideration are set out in these two reports.  I understand that these reports have been made available to members.

It has more than 25,000 members. This membership incorporates all disciplines of the engineering profession in Ireland - consulting and contracting organisations, the public sector, semi-State bodies and educational institutes.  Our members are organised into regional branches, engineering divisions and societies.  Engineers Ireland awards the professional title of chartered engineer in line with the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.  Chartered engineers have been assessed by their peers as professionals in their field in delivering the highest standards of quality, expertise and innovation to serve the needs of society while ensuring public health and safety.  They adhere to the Engineers Ireland code of ethics in all  areas of their engineering practice. The registered professional title is recognised  internationally and under Irish law.  According to the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations (SI 9 of 2014 and code of practice, chartered engineers are one of the three professions that may act as assigned certifiers.  Engineers Ireland has also established and maintains registers of suitable qualified persons in specialist areas, including IS 398 pyrite assessment and remediation, historical landfill and IS 465 mica and pyrite.  Our members contribute to the development of national standards and policies with consultative groups across industry.  Recent submissions include a draft code of practice for fire safety assessment of premises and buildings, a submission to the joint Oireachtas committee on professional indemnity insurance and submission on the climate action plan in May 2021.<\/p> <p>  It is important to understand the role of the engineer in the context of IS 465.  IS 465 establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing excessive amounts of certain deleterious materials - aggregate containing free or unbound muscovite mica or potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite.  It describes the methods for establishing the extent of the problem and categorise dwellings, the scope of any testing required and the evaluation of the findings and provides the chartered engineer with guidance on the selection of the appropriate remedial works to be undertaken.  The role of the registrant, an engineer on the IS 465 register, as set out is purely to prescribe-oversee testing and provide guidance on appropriate remedial works.  By virtue of being on the IS 465 register, a registrant is not acting as an assigned certifier or in any other statutory role.<\/p> <p>  In late 2018, Engineers Ireland was requested by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to provide a training programme with the outcome of establishing and maintaining a register of engineers considered competent to assess buildings damaged due to precast concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials in accordance with the standard and hold professional indemnity insurance.  This register lists chartered engineers who have the necessary direct professional experience, competency and specialist training in accordance with the requirements set out in the standard.  The register went live in June 2020 and in the region of 30 engineers are on the register.<\/p> <p>  Since the inception of the register, Engineers Ireland registrants have provided feedback based their experience on the operation of the defective concrete blocks scheme and surveys conducted by registrants on several hundred properties.  This feedback included making the case for the extension of IS 465 and associated grant scheme beyond Donegal and Mayo on 16 December 2020 and a submission to the working group on the defective blocks grant scheme on 21 September 2021.  The September 2021 submission provided a wide-ranging perspective on the operation of the scheme and highlighted areas that were perhaps discussed today such as pyrrhotite and cavity foundation.  The overwhelming sentiment from registrants regarding the scheme was the lack of certainty concerning partial remediation and the liability for any second and subsequent investigation and remediation works.  In addition, there was evidence that there was a potentially different mechanism of deterioration of concrete blocks.  This aspect requires additional investigation to accurately characterise mechanisms of deterioration so that suitable remedies can be designed and implemented.  Subsequent to these inputs, Engineers Ireland was invited to participate in the expert group on the enhanced defective concrete block grant scheme chaired by Mr. Paul Forde in February of this year.  This afforded the opportunity for engineering practitioners to provide input to the revised scheme.<\/p> <p>  Engineers Ireland has worked with stakeholders to implement a register of experts for the implementation of IS 465 and provide feedback from registrants to enable continuous improvement for all stakeholders.  We welcome the attention that the committee is giving to the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill and we look forward to working with the committee, Government and other stakeholders towards an improved solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Mahon to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#R00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The SCSI is the leading professional body for chartered surveying professionals working in the property, construction and land sectors across Ireland.  In addition, it operates the statutory register for the protected title of quantity surveyor and building surveyor.  In addition to promoting the highest standards in surveying, we undertake research on a wide range of economic, industry and practice-related issues in the public interest to produce regular reports including relating to construction costs.  Some committee members are serial attenders at our briefings.<\/p><p>In recognition of this construction cost expertise and the independence of the SCSI, we were requested by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to provide construction cost information for the Government&rsquo;s defective concrete blocks grant scheme in late 2021.<br\/><br\/>The terms of reference were agreed upon between the Department and the SCSI on 7 February 2022.  These terms set out the parameters within which the SCSI would produce an independent, stand-alone construction cost report for the demolition and rebuilding of homes affected by defective concrete blocks, which was option No. 1 in the terms of reference, and also propose a cost methodology for partial remediation, which were options Nos. 2 to 5.  It should be noted that the report is based on the parameters of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme as announced on 30 November 2021.  The SCSI had no role in setting the parameters of the grant scheme, including, for example, in respect of which building regulations apply and the exclusion of foundations, etc., and also no role in the setting of the grant amount.  The SCSI report on construction costs for the defective concrete block scheme was published on 3 March 2022 and was welcomed by all stakeholders, including the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the MICA Action Group.  The SCSI undertook this extensive work <i>pro bono<\/i>in the public interest and was supported by a significant number of our volunteer chartered quantity surveyor and chartered building surveyor members.  Hundreds of volunteer hours were involved.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the report methodology and key findings, the SCSI produced a bespoke, stand-alone report on the full demolition and rebuild costs, in the context of remediation option No. 1, for homes affected by defective concrete blocks in the north west as of February 2022.  As per the terms of reference and the parameters of the scheme, while the SCSI position is that it is best practice to build to current building standards, the costs in the report are based on new for old without betterment, on pre-2008 building regulations and on excluding new foundations.  Consideration of the 2014 Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, was included, because that standard is central to quality assurance as it is of particular importance that building regulations are adhered to for all developments to ensure defective building issues are not repeated.  The costs do not include fees for the scheme itself, as noted in table 2 on page 8 of the report.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding the methodology, the pricing schedules were drafted by an SCSI expert working group and issued to chartered quantity surveyors based in the north west, primarily in Donegal, with direct professional experience of residential development and mica-impacted homes.  The completed schedules were returned in February to provide up-to-date, relevant cost data for the report.  These returns were analysed by the working group, with further input from additional chartered quantity surveyors experienced in the field.  Additional cost data from the Department and the MICA Action Group were also reviewed as part of the consideration of average rebuild costs.  Average rebuilding rates for eight house types, including typical estate-type homes and one-off homes, were provided, ranging from &euro;145 per sq. ft to &euro;165 per sq. ft, priced at February 2022 material and labour rates.<br\/><br\/>It is particularly important to note and stress that the costs outlined in our report are average costs based on agreed unit sizes and on an agreed specification, as outlined in detail in our terms of reference.  In addition to option No. 1, the full demolition and rebuild approach, the SCSI considered options Nos. 2 to 5, concerning partial remediation, of the grant scheme as part of this report.  The report includes a non-exhaustive list of ancillary items that would inform the construction costs.  We found these elements to be extremely site-specific; therefore, we believe estimates based on gross floor area were inappropriate.  I mean that expressing estimates for remediation work based on cost per sq. ft is inappropriate.  A site-specific cost exercise will have to be undertaken for the specific elements to be replaced, incorporating the additional items affected in the context of those elements referred to above.  The determination of how such a site-specific remediation scheme would be established is a policy matter.  A model similar to the I.S. 465 register of chartered engineers, as referred to earlier, may provide a blueprint for establishing a panel of appropriately qualified professionals to undertake such work.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the impact of construction cost inflation, we were pleased to engage with this committee at the end of last month on this issue and our submission to that meeting set out our views on the current uncertainty impacting the sector.  Of note is the fact that some commentators discussing residential construction cost inflation refer to the SCSI tender price index and our house rebuild calculator.  These aspects, however, are not appropriate reference points for the defective concrete block scheme as the tender price index relates to commercial property, while the house rebuild calculator is intended for insurance purposes for individual estate-type houses only.  For this reason, the SCSI undertook to produce a stand-alone, bespoke report for the defective concrete block scheme.<br\/><br\/>The input costs of delivering residential developments, be they single or multi-unit developments, are wide-ranging.  They include hard costs, which are the construction costs, and soft costs, such as planning, enabling works, utility connections and charges, building control regulation and other statutory costs.  The primary drivers for the current price inflation, though, are high price volatility across a range of building materials, particularly insulation, cement, plasterboard, metals, fuel and labour cost increases, as well as the extremely high demand for projects underway across many tiers as the industry continues to readjust in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.  Furthermore, regarding the first half of 2022, it is clear that Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has impacted the price of materials previously sourced from that region, especially steel and base metals, while it has also led to a dramatic increase in fuel and energy costs.<br\/><br\/>Despite the volatility in construction costs, only a short time has passed since the SCSI defective concrete block report.  If there is a requirement to determine the impact, if any, of current construction cost inflation on the rebuild figures from February, we believe that the most accurate way to do this would be to re-do the entire cost exercise in full for all eight house types.  For our part, and this is noted in our report, we have undertaken to review these costs and update them in March 2023.  I note as well that we previously offered to re-cost the current study that the members have in the context of applying current standards and including new foundations when required.<br\/><br\/>The SCSI welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the resolution of this critical issue.  We appreciate its gravity, and we undertook this extensive work in good faith and in the public interest.  We are pleased that the report has been generally positively received by stakeholders.  We thank all those that contributed and we wish the committee well in its ongoing scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l Mahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mahon.

Starting with Mr. Forde, and focusing on the recommendation of the expert group concerning the damage threshold, there is concern that this aspect is going to be used to exclude homeowners rather than anything else.  This concern is exacerbated by the specific citing of work completed by Mayo County Council on the damage threshold.  I am sure Mr. Forde is aware that Mayo County Council proposed to exclude 20 homeowners from the current scheme last August.  On taking an independent appeal, 19 of those people won their cases.  Mr. Forde may not be aware, however, that the county council, when sending out an engineer earlier this year to assess new applications from homeowners, sent someone who was not I.S. 465 qualified.  In that context, he will understand that people are experiencing weariness and a lack of confidence in Mayo County Council regarding the damage threshold issue.  Will Mr. Forde share the work that Mayo County Council prepared for the expert working group?  It is not cited, but just referred to in the report.  Will the damage threshold differ depending on whether a situation involves pyrite, mica or pyrrhotite?<\/p> <p>  This leads me on to the issue of pyrrhotite.  Given Mr. Forde's experience in this area, and he is highly regarded in respect of his expertise, what is his view on this issue?  We heard evidence in the last session that it is extremely prevalent and exceptionally corrosive.  I would like to hear Mr. Forde's thoughts on this aspect, given his experience in this regard.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the process for admitting other counties, and we know there are at least 12 more counties involved, people in County Sligo have been waiting for some time.  They are very frustrated by the process.  We had the experience of people in Clare as well, who were forced to go through many hoops, as we heard about earlier.  All the time this is happening - and I need everybody to understand this - it is adding to the stress experienced by each homeowner.  These are homeowners, families and people whose entire lives have been turned upside down through no fault of their own.  This is what we must all keep in our minds during all the work we are doing on this.  This is not about facts and figures; it is about people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#S00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>The Deputy posed three questions.

I have been actively involved in remediation schemes since 2014 at various levels and have been involved in the successful completion of about 2,500 pyrite remediation houses since then.  As Mr. Forde stated, one of the group's key tasks was to assess the entry level of a damage threshold to be considered.  The scheme I manage at the moment is the pyrite remediation scheme, which is often referred to as the east coast scheme.  IS 398 sets out the thresholds and damage levels to be met for entry to the pyrite remediation scheme.  IS 398 has categorisation of zero damage up to a damage condition rating of 2, or DCR 2.  Scheme participants who are currently accepted into the scheme must have achieved at least a DCR 2.  They would have significant damage as defined in the Pyrite Resolution Act and they would also have test results, sub-floor, correlating with pyrite reactive, from a low to a significant level.<\/p> <p>  The task of the group was to review how we could manage the inflow of applications into the defective concrete blocks scheme and look at what level of damage could be perceived to create an entry point.  The key objective was to be homeowner-focused, dealing initially with the worst cases of damage, bringing them to the front and dealing with them as early and as soon as possible and assisting homeowners in getting through that process.  In the first three or four years of the scheme we managed in IS 398, the majority of the worst-case damaged homes were entered in and successfully remediated with all homeowners back in their homes.<\/p> <p>  We reviewed the IS 398 standard.  We also looked at industry standards with regard to damage to properties.  The collective agreement among the working members of the group, representatives of which are here, was that the IS 465 needed to have a qualification on a threshold, so that an entry point for the worst affected homes could be considered.  The consensus was, as in the expert report, that a minimum damage of 1.5 mm of cracking to the external leaf would be set as the entry level for damage.  The collective group also recommended that this be reviewed, perhaps annually, and updated to reflect the flow of applications and the level of damage that was being met with analysis of information, be it in testing results or in the information being received in the damage condition rating reports that were coming in.  Those are the considerations of the working group on the damage condition threshold and how we got to the collective recommendation of 1.5 mm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Did the group analyse the 900 applications under the current scheme?

We understand the Act will probably be commenced in September, October or November of this year, which would mean the first review and first possible increase in those rates will be at the latter end of 2023.  I know it is impossible to predict inflation but given that the Minister must also remain within a 10% cap when he or she - perhaps the Minister will be replaced - deals with the matter in the latter half of next year, how likely is it that inflation will be at or below 10% of the rate set in the report the SCSI has just done?

We have homes which should be safe and comfortable places for people to live but clearly are not.  That is something that all of us in the committee want to rectify for families.  <\/p> <p>  In response to the work and recommendations that the expert group put together, and the amplification it had from residents&rsquo; voices and their recommendations, there are many welcome changes in this latest iteration; most of which came from the expert group report and directly from homeowners.  These are things like the taking on of the cost of testing; retrospective inclusion; the certificate of remediation having that legal footing; an appeals processl and, of course, the extension to other counties. <\/p> <p>  My first question is to ask Mr. Owens about the extension of the IS 465:2018 beyond Donegal and Mayo.  Is he satisfied about how that is dealt with in this legislation?<\/p> <p>  My second question is directed to Mr. Mahon and I thank him and all of the members of his organisation for all of the work they have done on this.  It has produced what he refers to as a standalone, bespoke report which is crucial to ensuring that this scheme is as fair and as equitable as possible.  There are hard costs, soft costs and auxiliary items are all included, and there are very thorough costings.  A great amount of work has gone into it.  I, like others, am worried about the impact of inflation and I appreciate that he has offered to work on an annual basis, which is very useful.  I would like to learn a little more, however.  If he was asked to look at things again about how long I would like to know how long his work would take, how big a body of work it would be and would that delay matters in any way ?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#U01100","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I will address initially the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the ability of IS 465:2018 to be extended to other regions.  Our members undertook a survey about a year into the operation of the scheme to get members' feedback and the evidence from members and registrants was that they had seen evidence of deterioration in other counties.  Based upon that and on getting core samples done, which was evidence-based, the case was then made to extend the scheme to those counties.  The key thing is that any extension is based upon evidence but that evidence will require a great deal of testing.  We and our members are already seeing that there are considerable delays in having additional testing done and there is pressure on testing resources whereas, originally, a test could be completed and results could be back in three or four weeks.  That is now taking several months.

On 8 February a retrofit grant system was launched for this country and the SCSI was present at the launch.  The figures given on the day were from October.  I deal with quantity surveyors on a daily and weekly basis.  I understand that regions can vary and that the price per square foot can change but quantity surveyors are usually given between two and three weeks to come back with a price for a project that we might be looking at.  Once you have the baseline set up on your system you can work throughout this whole country.  At the moment the price per square foot in Limerick is between &euro;172 and &euro;180.  I can tell the witnesses that because I am dealing with it on a daily basis.  I understand that the witnesses are dealing with different regions.  An insulation increase of 25% is coming on 1 July, news of which came to me by letter from Kingspan.  I get weekly letters from suppliers to tell me about the different increases on different products.  Some increases come every fortnight and some come every month.  Concrete and different aggregates usually come every month but suppliers of insulation might write to me every two weeks.  We have a computer system that updates that and shows, on a weekly to two-weekly basis, how fast this is moving.  That is why I have not priced houses in two years.  It is too dangerous to do so because one increase could take out your profit margins.<\/p> <p>  The lack of builders is also driving the price up because we do not have the tradesmen.  We are ten years behind in apprenticeships.  A figure of &euro;145 per square foot does not fit with me, no matter where you are in the country.  A figure of &euro;170 to &euro;180 per square foot is more accurate.

It has been brought to our attention that there is a potential new causation, which is pyrrhotite, which may be a contributory factor or may be a primary proximate cause.  However, there is another one as well which has not been getting as much daylight or publicity, and that is what we call weak concrete blocks in themselves and where they then undergo wetting and drying cycles during the course of their life.  Over time those weak concrete blocks break down and they effectively mirror the damage that one would see by pyrite or with mica, but there is no smoking gun.

Pyrrhotite in itself is not a new issue.  We knew about pyrrhotite when we were dealing with the IS 398 problems.  The difference is that pyrrhotite within the infill material was reacting so fast, because of the type of lithology and the type of geology we were dealing with, that we were not really finding any damage resulting from that pyrrhotite.

The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has done a substantial amount of work in upgrading those standards, in particular, say, the aggregates committee.

I think we are on the same page with much of this.  This afternoon has been really interesting.  I thank all the witnesses for their submissions.  Coming from County Mayo, a number of questions are still outstanding for me.  One thing that really struck me was when Mr. O'Connell said we are working in a live laboratory situation.  The challenge for us is that we are approving or helping to finalise a scheme that needs to be able to cope with that and be flexible enough.  I think we will find this in blocks and foundations in Erris and Belmullet when we go into County Mayo.  We know for a fact that foundations have been built with the same blocks that were used to build houses that have been certified as having pyrite in them.  We cannot reconcile the fact that the blocks would be different in the foundations than when used to build houses that have pyrite.<\/p> <p>  This is my main question.  What flexibilities do the witnesses recommend we work into the scheme so that when we come to the point when the foundations need to be replaced, whether it be in weeks or months, we can do so within the terms of the scheme?  By the same token, in terms of the total rebuilds that are needed, again, that has been verified across the board in County Mayo.  Obviously, we are accumulating evidence all the time.  With any of the homes I have seen, I have witnessed people trying to repair their homes over the last ten years and I have seen what has happened through the months and years.  To me, the repairs have been useless.  Who will be responsible for signing off on these homes if the work that is being done is perhaps not as insurable and is not then fit for purpose if it is proven to be the wrong decision in terms of the options that are chosen?  My two main questions then are on foundations and in terms of the total rebuilds that are needed and who will be responsible for signing off on that<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#AA02500","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>To whom is the Deputy's question directed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#AA02600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>It is perhaps to Mr. O'Connell first because he understands, as does everyone, that we are working in a live laboratory situation.

I have quite a strong point on that with regard to the exposure of the engineers who will then be signing off on the rebuilds.  Currently, I think Mr. Forde's and my practice are probably the only two practices in the country that have been able to get professional indemnity insurance to deal with pyrite remedials or works involving pyrite.  I was talking to one of the leading geo-technical consultants, whom I would say is probably number one in the country, only last week and he said he cannot get professional indemnity cover for pyrite.  Certainly, our own professional indemnity insurance has doubled in price singularly because of the pyrite issue.  It is not because of any claims but singularly because of the pyrite issue.  I see that as a huge problem and I have raised it with Engineers Ireland because getting affordable insurance, if any insurance, will be an absolute nightmare.  The responsibility is supposed to be with the competent person, be it a chartered building surveyor, chartered engineer or architect to sign off on these properties.  At the moment, however, my practice will certainly not be signing off on any of them because the professional indemnity insurance is going to go catastrophically high for dealing with these types of properties.  That is issue No. 2.<\/p> <p>  Issue No. 1 is in relation to what happens in terms of the flexibility of the scheme.  As I said, we are going to be living in a live laboratory but we will be dealing with the worst cases at the very beginning, which then means that as we progress through the scheme, we will be dealing with properties that are getting progressively worse or where we will see progressive damage.

As Mr. Owens mentioned, a sample of some of the redacted reports was reviewed by the expert group that gave some examples of data collated from Mayo.  We also looked at our experience of having remediated approximately 2,500 houses and the damage criteria assessed against IS 398, a similar type of scheme.  We also reviewed some other industry-recognised standards for determining crack width and damage to properties; they would be set out in <i>Subsidence of<\/i><i>Low-Rise Buildings, 3rd Edition<\/i>, from the Institute of Structural Engineers in 2000 and the <i>Building Research Establishment Digest<\/i>, No. 251.<br\/><br\/>Reviewing all those documentation and bearing in mind the high level of applications that would be received by the scheme, and with the ultimate aim of bring worst-case homes to the front, looking after and prioritising them, the collective group decision was that 1.5 mm was a fair and reasonable reflection of that threshold.  The group also recommended that it would be reviewed, similar to the Structural Engineers Ireland, SEI, costings on a regular basis.  This would take into account whether the threshold has held, if it must be adjusted or if there is information from other studies of the NSAI on whether it is foundation or core testing from the Housing Agency that will carry out the protocol to assist us in reviewing that threshold.

The information Mr. O'Connell has given us is very useful.  I will certainly be contacting Ms Mair&eacute;ad Phelan in the NBCO.  I suggest that Engineers Ireland has a responsibility to pass that information on, but not in this forum, for legal reasons.  I am aware of a number of quarries outside of Dublin.  On foot of getting that information, I have contacted the NBCO.  It has the statutory authority to inspect.<\/p> <p>  This is a very serious issue.  To go back to the question Deputy Matthews asked, there have been no reforms of any aspect of the regulated regime to ensure adequate compliance with the standards for the manufacturing of building products since this issue first arose.  In fairness to former Deputy Phil Hogan, when he was the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government he introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013.  He made some changes - although they were not as strong as some of us would have liked - to the enforcement and regulation of the building process.  There is nothing stopping either rogue apples or systemic problems in our system.  One bad quarry, over a decade, can be responsible for the total number of damaged houses we have in County Donegal today.  Whether it is a few bad apples or something more, it is really serious.  I wish to put on record that the contact details of the NBCO are public.  The NBCO wants to know about breaches, even from those who have heard reports second- or third-hand.  It will inspect and enforce the regulations.  It is such a big issue.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a small point in respect of foundations, which is important.  The real issue here is not about foundations, block or infill.  It is where the aggregate that produces those things comes from.  It is possible that in the pyrite remediation scheme there might have been different sources of aggregate going into, for example, the infill and the foundations, whereas in some of the regional markets in the west, the same aggregate suppliers might have been sourced for the infilled foundations in the block.  That would mean that the gut response, which in fairness to Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Forde they have outlined here, may be appropriate on the east coast but may not be appropriate in the west.  However, we do not know whether that is the case because it was never tested.  It is important to make that clear.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions, the responses to which I think will be helpful.  Clearly the review of IS 465 is really important to the success of the scheme. I ask the witnesses to give us some information on where that review is at, who is involved, when the work is likely to be completed and, crucially, if it is possible for the work to be completed before the new scheme opens.  That would be the optimal solution.  Nobody wants to delay the scheme.  If any of the witnesses has information on that, I would be very pleased to hear it.<\/p> <p>  The second question is for the representatives of Engineers Ireland and relates to the issue of insurance that Mr. O'Connell spoke about.  One of my concerns in the way the scheme is designed, particularly for the remediation options and not the demolition and rebuild options, is that there may be conflicts of opinion between the engineer who was originally employed by the family to do the conditions survey and who may at a later date be asked to be the certifier for the works, and the assessment by the engineer working for the Housing Agency.  Ultimately, the test of whether an engineer believes an option is the right option is if he or she is willing to certify it and put his or her liability insurance on the line.  From the surveys Engineers Ireland has done of its members, are there any concerns about potential conflicts of opinion?<\/p> <p>  Finally, going back to the issue of foundations, nobody should be delayed.  The inclusion of foundations in the cost of remediation is not an enormous expense.  In fact, the exclusion of foundations is nothing do with the cost.  Our understanding is that it has more to do with the issue around whether a provider complies with the 2008 building regulations or the 2014 regulations.  Would it be a good idea to apply the precautionary principle, especially when the cost might be minimal in terms of the overall cost of the grant?  Has there been any discussion of the \"if in doubt, leave it out\" idea?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#CC00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Deputy's first two questions.  On the IS 465 review, as I understand it work is under way.  Engineers Ireland has already been approached by NSAI to obtain some views from our registrants on foundations.  It is also my understanding that a tender process has been completed to get research work done on the composition of the various components.  It will be for geologists to do work on the characterisation of the materials.  That work is under way.  On the question of how long the work will take, I have no idea.  There may be some indication made in the next session.  To respond to the Deputy's point, I do not think the work will be completed before the new scheme opens.  It will take time for the research to be completed.  It should be allowed to be completed so that we can go forward acting on fact.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question on the issue of conflicts of opinion, our members sign up to a code of ethics and they should avoid conflicts of interest.  The number of the current list of registrants is quite low, as I mentioned previously.  That will increase as the scheme expands.  The engineers working on the scheme are pretty much bound by geographic region.  For example, an engineer who becomes a registrant in County Wexford is not going to do surveys in County Donegal.  As the scheme expands, more and more engineers will become involved with it.  That will increase the pool of opinions in the certifying and signing off process.  Therefore, I do not have many concerns over conflicts of opinion.  I will refer to one of the other witnesses to respond to the Deputy's last question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Owens"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I will add a little to that.

I am acting assistant secretary in the housing affordability, inclusion and homelessness division in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Paul Benson and John Wickham.  We are pleased to attend alongside the Housing Agency and thank members for inviting us to assist the committee in its discussions and deliberations on the general scheme of the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme of the Bill is the culmination of six months of work and stakeholder engagement since the Government decision of 30 November 2021 on this matter.  I thank all who have helped bring us to this point: the Attorney General and his office, including the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, who have put considerable time into advising and guiding on the development of the scheme; the members of the expert group on technical matters, under the chairmanship of Paul Forde; the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, for its report on construction costs related to remediation works under the scheme; homeowners and their representatives, who have continued to engage with the nominated liaison as the scheme has been developed; the Housing Agency, which is taking on a critical role on behalf of local authorities under the enhanced scheme; and my colleagues, who have worked extremely hard on the defective concrete blocks issue over the past six months.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme encompasses the key decisions made by Government last November.  These include a 100% grant to an overall maximum amount payable to an applicant under the scheme of &euro;420,000.  Within that overall maximum grant, grant assistance is available for alternative accommodation costs at &euro;15,000, storage costs at &euro;5,000 and immediate repair works at &euro;5,000.  Increased grant rates in the scheme take account of a report on construction costs provided by the SCSI.  I note the rates are set to ensure that homeowners will get a rate equal to or greater than those contained in the report of SCSI for remediation works under the scheme.  The removal of the financial barrier to scheme entry which is a feature of the current scheme reduces the cost for homeowners from up to &euro;7,000 to an estimated &euro;500 to &euro;700, which will be recoupable under the scheme by approved homeowners.  A damage threshold for entry to the grant scheme will be set in order to ensure the worst-affected homes are first into the enhanced scheme and prioritised for approval and remediation.  The expert group has made a recommendation in relation to the appropriate damage threshold which should apply.  This is being considered by the Minister and will, when agreed, be provided for under regulations.  A second grant application opportunity is being made available to homeowners who are approved for remediation options other than full demolition and rebuild.  This second grant opportunity works as the form of guarantee which has been sought by homeowners and will remain available for 40 years.  Review by Government of the maximum grant amount and rates will take place as appropriate.  The extension of the scheme beyond owner-occupied principal private residences will include rented dwellings, to a maximum of one per homeowner, that were registered with the residential tenancies board on or before 1 November 2021.  The scheme provides for the establishment of an independent appeals panel and gives clarity on the four key decisions which can be appealed by homeowners, namely, validation of an application, meeting the damage threshold, the remediation option and grant amount, and a refusal by a local authority to pay a grant.  Clare and Limerick will be included in the enhanced scheme upon commencement, and further local authority areas can be added as the necessary evidence supports inclusion.<\/p> <p>  I bring to the committee's attention a number of other issues relevant to the scheme and the matters under consideration.  First, a review of a number of technical standards called for by the Government has begun.  These include the IS 465 standard for the assessment, testing and categorisation of impacted homes; consideration of the potential impact of other deleterious materials, for example, pyrrhotite, and the impact or otherwise of those deleterious materials on the foundations of homes impacted; the review of the Irish standard for concrete blocks, including aggregates; and the review of the potential impact, if any, of full cavity insulation on homes susceptible to damage or damaged by defective concrete blocks.  The Housing Agency is being resourced to fulfil the crucial role it will play in the independent determination of the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home.  There is the intended introduction of an Exchequer-funded scheme of assistance for local authority and approved housing body-owned social homes which are impacted.  There is provision for a review of the operation of the legislation after three years or sooner if that becomes necessary on foot of a change to the IS 465 standard currently under review.<\/p> <p>  Our Department made a presentation available for circulation to committee members which provided a recap on the current scheme, the challenges and issues which arose, how those challenges are being responded to, how the new scheme will work and the essential next steps to enable it to commence, which, I hope, members find helpful.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions members may have or to provide further details as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Timmons"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank committee members for the opportunity to speak to them today.  I am the CEO of the Housing Agency.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Peadar Espey, programme manager for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  The Housing Agency is a Government body that supports the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, local authorities, and approved housing bodies, AHBs, in the delivery of housing services and solutions.  Our work is framed under three broad themes: being a centre for housing and technical knowledge, supporting the delivery of Government programmes, and building capacity to address complex issues within the housing sector.<\/p> <p>  The agency's work that is most relevant to today's discussion is our experience in delivering the pyrite remediation scheme.  We have delivered that scheme on behalf of the Pyrite Resolution Board since 2014.  This involves carrying out the remediation of homes damaged due to pyritic heave caused by the swelling of hardcore underground floor slabs.  The Housing Agency has gained a lot of technical knowledge in delivering the scheme.  We are also acutely aware of the difficulties and disruption endured by homeowners whose homes have been damaged by pyrite, and we have set out to provide a service that is sympathetic, transparent and efficient.  By the end of 2021, just under 2,300 homes had been remediated.  We expect to remediate a further 300 homes, approximately, this year.<\/p> <p>  On the scheme under discussion today, the Housing Agency does not have a role under the current grant scheme but we have been asked to support homeowners and local authorities under the enhanced scheme announced by the Minister last November.  The local authorities are the scheme's administrators.  They are responsible for processing grant applications and for communicating decisions to homeowners.  The Housing Agency's role is to act as agents of the local authorities.  Once a local authority has validated a homeowner's grant application, we will assess the application by conducting a technical review of the building condition assessment report prepared by the homeowner's engineer.  The first step will be to determine if the home has met the damage threshold for entry to the grant scheme.  If the damage threshold has been met, the second step will be to prioritise homes for assessment, sampling, testing and categorisation.  The Housing Agency will then provide the local authority with the determination on the remediation option and the maximum grant amount, based on the calculation methodology and rate provided.  The local authority will then inform the homeowner of the outcome of his or her application.<\/p> <p>  In respect of our work to date in preparation for the scheme, we have engaged constructively with the homeowner forum group, chaired by Mr. John O'Connor, over recent months.  We provided three technical staff to the expert group and we have held frequent meetings with officials in Donegal County Council and Mayo County Council.  We have also been preparing our team.  There will be five whole-time technical staff working on the scheme, four of whom will be based in the north west, including programme manager Mr. Espey.  They will be supported by IT, finance and administration personnel in the agency.  We will keep resources under continual review based on the entry of additional local authority areas to the scheme, including Clare County Council and Limerick City and County Council.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency is in the process of establishing a framework of suitably qualified chartered engineers through public procurement.  We have conducted a market engagement survey of IS 465 trained and registered chartered engineers to establish their interest in the scheme.  This engagement has been positive.  Once the framework is established, efficiencies will be generated by grouping multiple individual properties within geographical areas for assessment and testing.<\/p> <p>  As we know, the scheme is being extended to Clare and Limerick and it is envisaged other areas may end up entering the scheme.  To assist the Minister in considering new areas for inclusion, the agency will be involved in assessing properties in areas where it is considered defective blocks may be present.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency is committed to supporting homeowners and local authorities affected by defective concrete blocks.  We aim to create a simplified, cost-efficient and effective process for local authorities and homeowners.  The Housing Agency will work closely with all stakeholders to build confidence and trust in the revised scheme.  We will collate data and support research to ensure the scheme and stakeholders benefit from the learning we gain during delivery.  I thank members for the invitation.  We are happy to answer any of their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#HH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Jordan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We have quite a full house, which is good.

This has been a very worthwhile exercise and I thank them for their involvement to date.  Sometimes this issue has got very heated, but we recognise the witnesses bring a very important element to ensuring the scheme works.  We also appreciate the fact the scheme has evolved so much.  That flexibility has resolved many issues on the ground.  There are some more, which the officials will hear from members and others, but as far as I am concerned, I appreciate the changes that have taken place in the context of the evolving situation since the 90-10 scheme was announced.  As time moves on, it is important the Department does not take a position that this is now it.  The one thing I have learned, and I have been heavily involved in this over the past couple of years, as have others, is this situation is continually evolving.  Once the scheme is adopted, I have no doubt other situations will arise.  I hope the Department has the same approach as the Minister whereby there is flexibility because it is crucial to ensure these homes are protected.  It is also crucial to ensure these same mistakes are not made in the future.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I will ask them together and the representatives can answer what they can.  If they cannot conclude, I ask them to come back with a written reply at a later stage.  When was the Department first made aware of the presence of pyrrhotite in blocks in Donegal?  When was the research tender commissioned?  What is the status of, or timeline for, this research?  How long will it take the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, to review results to enable it to amend IS 465?<\/p> <p>  There are a few other bits and pieces regarding the legislation.  Last night, one case in particular was brought to my attention where an individual was awarded stage 2 in the grant process.  On examination of the building since the start of works at stage 2, the engineer realised the damage threshold has now increased to the extent that demolition is necessary.  He is no longer willing to stand over the building because the legislation states the applicant cannot go to demolition.  That is part of the new legislation.  Will the Department take a look at that?  It is in the Department's interest to ensure it considers a situation where an engineer comes along and states a building has deteriorated since testing to the extent that it is now declared fit for demolition rather than remediation.  It is important the legislation allows for that because we are dealing with professional opinions as regards somebody's individual opinion.  I ask the officials to reflect on that to see if something can be done about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#HH00300","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the questions.

I acknowledge their input.  This would not be possible without that.  I welcome Ms Timmons and Mr. Jordan today.  Given the time constraints, I will head up some headlines.  I will ask if they could supply the committee with some written responses to them, because they are quite detailed.  We have to tease out this legislation.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I want to mention, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin did, the idea that the local authority is responsible for processing the applications and for sending on the validation of applications, etc., to the Housing Agency.  That is an issue of resources for the local authorities in question.  They may grow.  There are quite a few there, but there may be more.  I would therefore like some commitment from the Department or some detailed statement on the funding.  This will be a large body of work for some local authorities.  There will be a certain amount of work for the Housing Agency.  The witnesses might touch on the issues of the funding, resources and expertise that are needed.<\/p> <p>  I would like a briefing document on subrogation, how that all works and how that can be rolled out.  I will not touch any more on that.  In relation to the planning permission exemptions for rebuilding or for modifications of these houses, we need clarity on the issues of the exemption, which is an issue of concern.  The other the issue is the excluded counties.  We need to know more about the pathways for these excluded counties if they wish to be included.  It is my understanding, although I am open to correction, that Limerick and Clare are going to being included.  We need a pathway.  We need to understand the pathway for other countries to come in, if that is an issue.<\/p> <p>  I also raise the appeals process.  There is a suggestion that there will be a ten-person appeals panel put in place.  At this stage, we do not understand this ten-person panel appeals process.  I would like some information on that.  It would be beneficial to the members of this committee, as well as to all the other people who are involved in this process today, for us to understand that.  <\/p> <p>  I also raise an area that we do not talk about enough, which is the issue of support for the vulnerable householders and families, for example with counselling and support for themselves and for their extended families.  This is an important aspect and it is a separate part of the compensation.  Mental health is a huge issue.  I talk to these people in Donegal and Mayo.  This is a mental health issue because it is an absolute nightmare for them to be living in these circumstances.  They are strapped for cash, their houses are crumbling all around them and the State has abandoned them.  That is what it amounts to.  We need to hear about that.  We need a briefing memo or a note on the Department&rsquo;s intentions.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I want to touch on the issue of culpability.  The Minister was reported the other day as saying that there will be some sort of a levy scheme.  Levies on buildings and on the construction sector are ultimately passed down to the consumer.  I have some concerns about that.  I understand that the Government is engaging with senior counsel.  They will appoint somebody.  There will be this issue to address.  Who will pursue the wrongdoers here?  That is what the public wants to know.  They want their homes to be replaced, but they want people to be held to account.  Smaller quarries or people in building, construction and the manufacturing industry have been bought out.  I will not name them, but I know that two or three major conglomerates in this country have bought some of them up.  Who is responsible?  The public is looking at the committee today.  They are aghast by the fact this is costing billions of pounds.  Rightly, people need to have their homes.  Yet, we have got to hold people to account.  That is what the public wants.  The public expects us to hold people to account.<\/p> <p>  In the last two minutes, Ms Timmons might focus on that.  I have asked that there would be a memo or report on each new issue I have raised here today and for it to be circulated as early next week as possible.  I know that the Department has to give consideration to it and I understand that.  However, in the last two minutes, can the witnesses tell me what the Government's intentions are?  What are the Department&rsquo;s intentions?  What knowledge do they have on how we are going to follow up and hold people to account for this absolute disaster?  That is what the public wants, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#KK00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I am taking a note of everything that the Senator has raised.  We will do our best to get back to him.  We are happy to do so insofar as we can.  The issues he has raised are important.  I would like to mention that we are more than empathetic to the issue that the Senator has raised of mental health.  We agree with him 100% that it is an important issue.  We have engaged with the Department of Health on that.  It is providing the MyMind service to homeowners in the affected areas.  The Senator brought attention to an important point.  We can provide him with more details on that.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the levy scheme, it is the case the Government has agreed that a levy scheme would be considered.  At the moment, the Department of Finance is considering how it might be worked and whether it can be brought under the Finance Bill 2022.  However, I do not have anything more to say about that at the present time.  We can update the Senator in due course as matters develop.  The Minister has expressed in the past that he is keen, just as the Senator is, to get to the bottom of the issue and to pursue wrongdoers in this respect.  It was agreed in November that senior counsel would be brought in review the matter.  The Department has been working in the background to develop some terms of reference.  We will look to progress that matter with the Minister as soon as we can.  We will try to get the Bill to the end point.  Then there are other matters we have to pursue in that respect.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly discuss the other matters.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the appeals panel earlier.  I wanted to point out that the Public Appointments Service, PAS, will deal with the appeals panels.  It will be an independent process.  We will make sure the criteria reflect that.  The Senator mentioned that the local authority that is responsible for the process must be resourced.  We already have many processes in place whereby local authorities need resources.  We are conscious of that in our Department.  If there is a need for extra resources, we will look at that in conjunction with the local authorities, which will be able to inform us of where they stand on that front.

We have the construction products regulation, which harmonises the rules for marketing of construction products.  To supplement performances that are required on a national basis, the National Standards Authority of Ireland produces standard recommendations.  They set performance limits on the chemical composition of particular aggregates and those are the limits and thresholds which specifiers, builders, etc. should look for on the declarations of performance that are an obligation of the manufacturer to produce at the outset.  Those standard recommendations are then referred to in our building regulations in our technical guidance documents and they perform the <i>prima facia<\/i>evidence of compliance with regulation.  Overarching enforcement of that regime is primarily with the 31 building control authorities, but now we have the strength and centralisation of market surveillance under the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office.  That has been a huge improvement in terms of looking at the extractive industries sector.  Since 2021, their programme of prioritisation would have to be focused on looking at aggregates for concrete and hardcore for underneath floor slabs.

There is a massive lack of trust among homeowners because of the way they have been treated.  Initially they ended up in the scheme.  The point was made earlier by one of the homeowner representatives that all of the key performance indicators in the scheme were on the homeowner.  The homeowner gets a deadline to provide information and a timescale to get it done and billed for.  There is very little on the Housing Agency and the local authorities.  What is the Housing Agency's view around that and putting in key performance indicators so that the homeowner will be treated with respect and will know when his or her application will be dealt with when it goes to the Housing Agency or the local authorities?<\/p> <p>  The appeals board makes a recommendation but the Housing Agency decides.

What is the timeline for the regulations if the legislation is passed before we go into recess?  What is the projected timeline for the publication of the regulations of the scheme?  I cannot overstate how real the issue of mental health is.  It is very specific to people who live in a home with either pyrite, mica or pyrrhotite.  There are homeowners who are appropriately qualified.  There are homeowners affected by pyrite, mica and inevitably pyrrhotite who have appropriate qualifications relating to mental health and they should prioritised with regard to support because they have walked and are walking the walk.  I do not think anyone of us here who is not in this situation truly knows what it is like to go to bed every night and wake up every morning with this problem.  This brings us back to the damage threshold.  I cannot describe what people went through last July and August in Mayo.  It was bad enough knowing they had pyrite.  To know that there was no future for them for those four weeks was cruel.  There was far more distress because of that than there was as a result of finding out about pyrite.  It is essential that the mental health supports are relevant to where people are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#NN02600","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655938800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Would the Chairman like us to start?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#NN02700","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Timmons"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I do not mind.

Mr. Benson said the engineer is not responsible for the foundations he does not put in.  He is wrong.  The engineer is responsible for the foundations on top of which he puts a structure.  He is completely wrong in the information he just gave.  Any engineer who has put a structure on top of an existing foundation is required to do all the tests to the existing foundation before he designs the product for it.  That means he is giving an undertaking that the foundation in place is adequate and correct for the construction of the building he is putting on top of it.  He has to sign off on it.  If he does not sign off on it, the insurance will not accept it.  I know this because I am in construction.  I am involved in renovations every day of the week and it is a standard practice.  What Mr. Benson is saying is wrong.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Benson said he has been involved in the issue of pyrite since 2013.  Why was a quarry making and delivering blocks around County Limerick and County Clare that now has 1,000 cases against it for houses on its own books?  As I am a bricklayer by trade, I understand.  Mr. Benson spoke about the difference in trades and workmanship.  Every section of every building we have ever done is overseen by competent engineers and other skilled people and if it is not right, they take it down.  It is all tested using certified materials.<\/p> <p>  I made a suggestion at the last committee meeting and you said you would listen to it.  Ireland recently had a census.  Every building that is due to get an SEAI grant gets cored, something the Department trying to drop out of this Bill.  The easiest way to test for pyrite is to use a chisel and chisel areas out or use a core which gives the full details of the blocks going through.  If we do not do a census of all the houses we are now retrofitting and insulation gets pumped on top of existing insulation making the mica travel from one side to the other, we will create a bigger problem for everybody down the line.  That is common sense.<\/p> <p>  Others can have titles and letters after their names, but I am dealing with this on a daily basis.  I can draw up plans and hand them to the structural engineer.  He will specify what has to go in and he hands it back to me to carry out the work with the proper materials.  In order to future-proof Ireland, the block work needs to be tested for every house that is going in for an SEAI grant, such as external insulation or cavity insulation.  It is a small price to pay.  We should then have a census in every county.  I welcome that Limerick and Clare have been included in it now.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I have been involved in building for over 30 years.  The same quarry has also provided blocks for public buildings.  We are talking about homeowners, we will now be talking about schools and public buildings after this where these same blocks had been supplied.  It was allowed to bring blocks from the quarry 12 months ago.  It only stopped 12 months ago.  It now owns most of the quarries around this country and is bringing blocks from different quarries.  Thank God, I never used its blocks on any of my one-off houses.<\/p> <p>  Foundations have gone in on rafts and the material is underneath the raft foundation.  Any house with an infill of over 900 mm is required to use a precast slab but most people did the infill anyway and put the precast slab over it to get rid of the void.  Some people actually put a liquid screed on top of that afterwards to seal it.  It depended on the specification of each individual engineer.  That makes common sense.  All house owners since 2002 have already paid tax on their houses at 13.5%.  Any house, back to &euro;80 per square foot in the 2000s up to whenever the rate went up, already paid &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 in tax.  In this, the VAT is included in the build.  On a &euro;420,000 house, there is &euro;49,996 VAT that is not going to them.  The maximum redress is not, as Mr. Benson has said, &euro;420,000, it is actually &euro;370,004.40.  On a 2,000 sq. ft house, it is &euro;3,600 at today's rate of &euro;1.80 per square foot.  I know that is today's rate because I deal with it on a daily basis.  That is a fact.  Mr. Benson has it is &euro;1.56 to &euro;1.61.  He is way off.  In addition, the Department is taking the &euro;50,000 tax back.  We need 100% redress.  The 100% redress means taking the VAT off to ensure that people can get their houses built to current standards which is what we want.<\/p> <p>  What engineer will design and build on top of a foundation he would not check out first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062300002#OO00500","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1655938800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Mr. Benson has about 30 seconds to answer that.

I am not sure how to resolve that issue but it is a live one on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I also want to put on the record the concern about external boundary walls and garages.  The scheme should cater for external boundary walls and garages.  It is not as though the mica does not matter in those walls.

Essentially, what the Department is doing is transferring the risk that all those quarries have of being sued onto the Exchequer.

They did not include demolition of the property.  The figure does not add up to 1,900-odd square feet.  Demolition costs bring us back to approximately 1,730 sq. ft.  There is also the builder's finish, which does not include all of the furnishings the homeowner takes out of the house and has to put back in.  In an average house, that cost is &euro;10,000 for bathrooms and &euro;15,000 for a kitchen.  That is another &euro;40,000 the homeowner has to come up with to refurnish the house.  Will homeowners take down the tiles in existing bathrooms and put them back up again?  They will not.

There is a realisation that not only in Donegal, Mayo or Clare because of mica but nationally because of the demand for building houses there is a lack of builders.  I have spoken to the head of the local employment office in Donegal who is very receptive to the idea I am going to put to the Department.  I suggest there should be specific courses run by the local employment offices for builders, as they have for people who want to run their own businesses.  Many people out there could become builders tomorrow but they do not have the competence or know-how.  We could use people such as Deputy O'Donoghue who is a builder or retired builders to work on a tailored builder course to help us have a sufficient number of builders for the mica scheme and to build houses throughout the country.
