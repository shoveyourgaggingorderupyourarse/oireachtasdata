I also thank Deputy Donnelly for his nice welcoming comments, which are very much appreciated.  I will come back to his question on Brexit at the first opportunity.  The amendments will bring CORU's, the multi-profession health regulator, fitness to practise process into line with those operated by the other health regulators.  The Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, and the Dental Council operate a two-stage fitness to practise sanction process wherein the fitness to practise committee may recommend a sanction to the council with the council making the ultimate decision as to the sanction.  CORU is an exception, as its legislation currently requires that the council also seeks recommendation from a profession's registration board before determining what sanction should be applied.  The council is not required to accept this recommendation.  This additional step generates a significant cost and administrative burden on the regulator and has been subject to criticism by the President of the High Court.  The additional step also creates an additional financial and emotional burden on the registrant during what is typically an extremely challenging period in his or her life.  The amendments will remove the requirement for the council to refer all sanction recommendations by the fitness to practise committee to the registration boards.  It should be noted that a representative of each of the designated professions sits on CORU's council.<\/p><p>I also wish to signal that a further amendment will be required on Report Stage to delete the recommendation making it a function of the registration boards contained in section 27 of the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#B01500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Sections 3 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

The Bill's draft section 26B sets out the means by which the Dental Council can recognise the qualifications for registration.  Section 26B.(1)(d), to which these amendments relate, concerns the recognition of qualifications which are neither an Irish qualification nor one automatically recognised under the professional qualifications directive.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit - a matter Deputy Donnelly was concerned about - this will apply to UK qualifications.  Section 27 of the Dentists Act is being repealed and the Bill's proposed text in section 26B.(1)(d) replicates the text from section 27(2)(d) of that Act.  However, on review, it was considered that the text could be made clearer.  The amendment to the Bill makes it clear that the Dental Council may approve courses of training and exams already undertaken to allow for registration, as well as specifying exams set by the Dental Council which applicants must take and pass to show equivalence in order to achieve registration.  This makes clear the legal base for any mutual recognition agreement which the Dental Council might make with a third country.  That is relevant to Deputy Donnelly's query.  The new text replicates text being inserted into the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, by virtue of section 83 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#B02100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I wish to ask about amendment No. 3 where it states: \"has a qualification in dentistry from a state other than the State and has passed an examination specified in rules made for the purposes of this paragraph\".

A number of doctors have been appointed to positions for which they were not qualified and we only found out about it afterwards.  Whatever system is in place, it is not working.  The system in place in veterinary medicine works extremely well because everything is blocked and nothing gets through, not even the smallest technical detail.  Qualifications make no difference because everyone has to sit the exams again when they come here.  I know that is a restrictive practice and I know the reason for it.  We need to be a little more alert in the area of human health too.  We must apply the highest European standards.  I do not agree with the notion that we should test everybody again and have a separate test, as we have in the medicines area, but we need a very rigorous application of the rules.

I am concerned that section 15 sets the High Court as the place for the person to go, including, I believe, for quite minor sanctions.  The High Court is very intimidating for many people, including myself.  It can be vastly expensive.  The idea that a healthcare professional who may have a legitimate grievance about a sanction against himself or herself would have to go to the High Court seems over the top.  Certainly healthcare professionals have raised the issue.  I know some of their representative bodies have raised the fact that various healthcare professionals would have to engage solicitors and barristers.  In respect of the workings of the courts, the High Court obviously deals with numerous issues and can have quite serious backlogs.  I wonder whether the High Court is the right place to go, first, as a reasonable path for somebody appealing what could be a very minor sanction and, second, for the courts in terms of the severity of some of the matters with which they deal.  Is that the right thing for the courts to do?  My focus, though, is on healthcare professionals.  I raised this issue on Second Stage and hoped there might be a Government amendment to that effect.  Could the Minister of State explain why such a high bar is being set for an appeal against what could be quite a minor sanction when minor sanctions in other areas, for example, driving or drug offences can be dealt with in lower courts?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#C04600","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I do not know if I am unique in this D&aacute;il but I think I am unique in this room in that I would have dealt with the outworkings of this legislation.  Appealing to the High Court is really onerous in terms of the time it takes and the stress it causes.  Let us not lose sight of the fact that it also costs the State a fortune.  I have been in the High Court on an appeal when I was given leave to represent a member.  He or she turns up with a full team.  It is a very expensive process for the State.  The High Court is there as an option but sometimes it is the only avenue for relatively minor matters.  Number one, it is extremely intimidating and number two, it costs a significant amount of money.  The healthcare professional is paying his or her retention fee so the organisation that receives that fee can spend a significant amount of money taking that healthcare professional and his or her colleagues to the High Court, not for serious matters - everybody appreciates that - but for relatively minor matters.  It seems a bit heavy.  It is very intimidating and time is also a factor because the courts probably have more onerous things with which to deal.  The healthcare professional has that hanging over him or her the entire time.  We are dealing with processes that with the best will in the world can take years.  The process has a significant impact on people's lives.  Nobody goes into these professions to have to deal with the legal profession and it is something that can hang over him or her.

It is not the sanction but the finding that is appealed.

A finding can impugn a person's professional good name.  That brings up the level of seriousness notwithstanding the Deputy's concerns about the person's ability to access the High Court and the cost.  I am not diminishing those issues but I want to give a bit of context.  This is why the High Court is included.<\/p> <p>  There are two sides to the argument about costs.  This is about trying to find a balance between the patient and the registrant, protecting the integrity of the healthcare system and the delivery of services to the patient and ensuring his or her rights are there and that the strictest and toughest standards are met at all levels.  If someone does go to the High Court, the costs will be awarded to the employer in some cases.  If someone has been wronged by his or her employer, one would expect the costs to be awarded.  I cannot prejudge what will happen or what an outcome will be.  Unions take a lot of these cases.  The main thrust of what I am trying to say is that it is essentially the finding that is being challenged, which is never minor.  There is no such thing as a minor finding when it involves fitness to practise and impugning someone's character and professional reputation as opposed to the sanction.

I am not sure whether the High Court should be the court of first instance.  It may be possible to have the matter dealt with in a lower court such as the Circuit Court with the option of referring it to the High Court for both sides.

Was this looked at?  We have probably all dealt with cases where healthcare professionals have had their lives destroyed by the HSE.  I have dealt with more than one case where it was done intentionally, vindictively and wrongly.  I have seen good people who had done nothing wrong, some of whom were what we would now class as whistleblowers, destroyed by management within the HSE.  I have seen how they have had to leave work and I have seen them leave the country.  I have seen people sitting in the High Court wondering whether the judge was going to award them costs because if the judge did not, they would lose their house.  Telling anyone that he or she has to go to the High Court to clear a minor sanction is an extraordinarily onerous thing to do.  It can cost the person his or her mental or physical health, reputation or house and it can destroy him or her financially.  Making it the first place somebody can go to is setting an exceptionally high bar.  If it is a major decision, such as a decision that a medical practitioner is unfit to practise, the High Court might be the only place he or she can go.  My understanding of the legislation is that this is for minor sanctions.  If a person's entire professional reputation is up for grabs and has received a decision that he or she is not fit to practise then maybe the High Court is the place to go.  As Deputy Durkan said, the judges in the High Court are very skilled and experienced.<\/p><p>My question is on minor sanctions because the reality is that for nurses, doctors and dentists, some of them will have the wrong decision made, even with the best will in the world, because bad information will be used in some instances.  I have seen cases, as most members probably have, where the HSE has intentionally moved to destroy good people for vindictive, petty and bad reasons.  If the only safeguard these people have is the High Court, they are stuffed.  It is not reasonable for someone to have to go to the High Court and put everything on the line, including their family home potentially, over a minor sanction.<\/p><p> Were other less onerous mechanisms looked at for minor sanctions?  If they were not looked at, will the Minister of State give an undertaking to the committee that before this comes back for Report Stage, maybe we can have an informal meeting with him, or with the Minister, Deputy Harris, the officials and the committee members?  Could the Minister of State come back and assure us he has looked at everything else and ideally come up with a better solution?  It is not reasonable because we all know what will happen.  When wrong decisions are made, as they are made sometimes with the best will in the world and the best motivations, what will happen is there is no way people will go to the High Court and risk their family home with everything that is involved in taking a High Court action against the State, because, as Deputy Durkan said, the State uses it as a tool.  A medical professional walks in with whatever solicitor and barrister he or she can afford but the State does not.  The State walks in with an army of lawyers.  It is not a fair fight.  Why does this happen for minor sanctions?  Has every other option been exhausted?  If it has not been exhausted, can we please look at this before this legislation comes back for Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#D00900","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I understand that when the Medical Council of Ireland sits, it sits with the power of the High Court and I can see why it has to be a like for like arrangement.

I would suggest that we ask someone to come in who has been through that experience, either from the representative bodies or the legal profession, who might be able to speak to how it happens.  It is a long and drawn-out process and I am not a legal expert but I have been through this process on more occasions than I would have liked.  I am talking about practical, hands-on experience but I am not somebody who will take us through the legalities of it.  The Minister of State can hear the concerns we have.

Of course the officials would be happy to sit down and discuss this.  There are a lot of precedents that inform these kind of decisions, namely the existing judicial system in Ireland.  If one is caught for a misdemeanour or an offence under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, he or she goes to the District Court.  If it is something more serious on a higher level, one goes to the Circuit Court and if it is of a high standing the High Court is appropriate.  This is following those legal precedents that are there.<\/p> <p>  I have to comment on Deputy Donnelly's repeated use of the term \"minor sanction\".  It is not a sanction.  The sanction cannot be appealed.  The finding can be appealed.  The High Court will not say that dismissing a claimant for three months was wrong and that he or she should have only got two months.  It will not do that.  It will just say that such a case was an impugnment of his or her professional conduct or character, and that is the most serious impugnment any of use can have on our fitness to practise on a daily basis.  It is recognising the seriousness of the finding that dictates the seriousness of a case, where it should be and the most appropriate forum in which to deal with it.  It is not to make it difficult for the registrant to access justice.  They can always go in their individual rights to any court on the day but there is an accepted legal journey that people take, depending on the viciousness of the wrong that is done to them.  Of course I accept there are costs involved but costs are awarded in accordance with the legal system and all of that.  This is not designed to make it difficult for the registrant to access justice.  I assure members this is just in recognition and respect of the existing judicial norms in the State.

I am looking for a better answer.  I accept the Minister of State's point.  It is a semantic point and I know the Minister of State is not trying to play with words.  When I say \"minor sanction\" I am talking about a minor finding, because there can be a finding where the Medical Council of Ireland says a person has committed gross misconduct and has been negligent to the point that he or she is believed to have endangered the lives of his or her patients.  That is the kind of finding one might take to the High Court.  Every single finding below that may not have had due attention paid to it for a particular period.  This person may have failed to follow a World Health Organization, WHO, protocol before going into an operating theatre, that had no effect on a patient although they should have followed the protocol.  There are myriad such scenarios and some are fairly minor findings.  The other thing this legislation does is state that every single finding against a healthcare professional will have to be made public.  This is serious because for anyone running a practice, people will be able to look up findings made against them.  That transparency is welcome but it puts an awful lot of weight on the findings; when a member of the public is looking at a dentist, a doctor or whatever service, they may just see that a person has had two or three findings made against him or her by the Medical Council of Ireland and decide not to go near him or her, whereas in fact those findings may be pretty minor.<\/p> <p>  This is very serious for the medical professional.  It is very serious for a GP, for example.  The Minister of State said in his response that the medical practitioner can go to any court.  He or she cannot; he or she can go to the High Court.  That is the point of this.  The only place he or she can go under section 15 of the Bill is the Court of Appeal or the High Court.  That is it.  I am not looking for a briefing to get clarity on why that is the case.  I do not accept the argument that this is the existing judicial norm.  The existing norm is that we have four or five layers of courts, depending on where the Court of Appeal is put.  Broadly, the severity of the situation warrants a higher court.  That is not the case here, however.  There is only one court and it is the second highest court in the land, which is not accessible to most people.  I am not looking for more clarity.  I am asking why other solutions were not looked at, such as an independent appeal board linked to the Medical Council of Ireland.  How about a non-judicial appeal first?  That could have been looked at and I do not see why that could not happen.  I am sure there are myriad other non-judicial or quasi-judicial solutions that could have been looked at.  Perhaps if the Medical Council of Ireland finds against someone and there is a professional non-judicial appeal board that also upholds the Medical Council of Ireland's finding, then the Circuit Court and the District Court simply are not equipped to deal with findings against a person's name and there is simply no choice.  This is binary.  The Medical Council of Ireland finds that one did not follow the correct WHO protocols, and while no patients were put at risk, protocols should have been followed.  The only option is to go to the High Court in that instance.  I am not asking for clarity on the decision made.  I do not wish to speak for anyone else on the committee but this does not feel appropriate.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State undertake to find a better solution between now and Report Stage?

Some years ago, I represented a nurse who had been struggling with addiction.  During the period of her addiction, she was guilty of poor professional performance but thereafter she had worked very hard and, with the support of her family, she got her life completely back together.  She had two years working seriously hard at recovery and returned to work in a healthcare setting, but not to nursing.  She had put everything behind her but then had to go through the fitness-to-practise hearing.  It is something that could have been kept out of the public domain, and giving the fitness-to-practise committee leeway to do that was really important there where the case could be made that that was not who that person is now and their life is different now.  This woman had made vast changes in her life.  All that publication, indeed mandatory publication as outlined here, would have achieved would be to bring her back to where she was.<\/p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to open a dialogue but also to remove the compulsory element in order that it should not be mandatory and that they be allowed to exercise a high level of discretion, especially in minor incidents.  We should also be mindful of the time it often takes to go to committee, with so much evidence to be gathered, that people can get back on track in the intervening time.  In that case, and in others, I felt that publication served no purpose.  It did not serve the public interest, it only undermined that woman and to bring her back to a place she had worked very hard to get out of.  Where there is a public interest, I fully respect that it be done.  That used to be the case.<\/p><p>In cases where discretion can be applied it should be.

While it is important that the HSE and employers receive information about sanctions against their employees, it is not necessary for the Minister to receive this information, particularly as the Acts provide for no function associated with receipt of it.  <\/p><p>On the other hand patients need to know that they are in safe hands when they entrust their health to a doctor or to another healthcare professional.  The public needs to have confidence in the role of the regulator to address deficiencies in competence, behaviour or standards, through a transparent system of mandatory publication of sanctions.  Accordingly, the Bill also provides that information on all sanctions will be made known to the HSE, to employers and to the public, where they are known.  This is an important patient safety measure, widely supported on Second Stage, which will ensure that information relating to sanctions imposed on registered health professionals is placed in the public domain.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that all disciplinary sanctions imposed by the five health regulators will be published, once confirmed by the High Court.

All of us accept that they exist, which is the point that the Deputy is trying to make and has succeeded in bringing to our attention and having recognised here.  There are exceptional circumstances that exist where publication is not in the best interest.  We would maintain that they are rare, are not the norm and are the exception, but they exist.

Of course, the regulator, as I understand it, can make a case to the High Court ahead of publication as things stand currently.  The regulator can say that he or she understands the case very well and believes it would not be in the interest of patients to publish but ultimately the determination must be made by somebody.  The registrant may not have to make the case to the High Court.  The regulator could say that having dealt with this, he or she would not be recommending publication and that happens.

At the end of hearing, one goes back for a confirmatory hearing.  One is sent the result, if I recall correctly.  I only have experience with one regulator and the system has changed somewhat.  My recollection is that one gets a result, goes back in for the confirmation and then one makes the case in situations where the issue is minor.  One does not go to the High Court with that because it does not need the approval of the court.  One goes in, brings a witness along and says that the person has got his or her life back together or that this was one minor incident that happened four years ago and the person&rsquo;s record has been exemplary since then and so forth.  One can make the case directly to people who are in the same profession and argue that the public interest will not be served by publishing the finding.  Now, however, that step is removed.  I am not referring here to cases where the issues are serious and the person has been struck off.  I am talking about cases that merit censure or admonishment because they are minor, although they may not seem minor to the person affected.  Under this legislation, such cases will now be funnelled automatically into the High Court and it is then up to the High Court to decide on publication.  Surely, at the lower level, where one is sitting in a room with a committee, one should be able to give reasons as to why it is not in the public interest to publish.  Once it goes to the High Court, one is in a somewhat adversarial process which is expensive.  It becomes quite intimidatory and scary and the process will take time.  It never gets to be over for the person.  I do not understand why in the case of lesser incidents, one would still have to go to the High Court.

They also have to be approved by the High Court before there is any talk of publication.  It has reached that stage anyway, having been through three or four steps.  We cannot look at this in isolation, from the original misdemeanour to the point of publication.

It is referred to in several times in the Bill, including in section 86, and I will address the totality of the issue.  There is a serious issue in this county with non-specialists working in specialist posts.  In layperson's language, non-consultants are working as consultants.  In some cases, they do not have the requisite qualifications and training, and patients have absolutely no idea that the person they are seeing is not a consultant.  We have discussed this issue before in the committee.  My fear is that if it is found in the future that there was negligence by any of these people, there could be serious consequences for patients, in the first instance, and for the State.  Anybody who is going in to see a consultant, having waited two or three years for an appointment, needs to know whether that person is, in fact, a consultant.<\/p> <p>  This issue has been raised several times since I became a member of the committee and the numbers are increasing.  I have submitted various parliamentary questions on the matter and, if I recall correctly, the latest figure was 168 non-consultants in consultant posts.

Rather than coming back to the issue as we discuss each relevant section, will the Minister of State agree to discuss it in totality at this point?

The court clarified that this threshold is provided for in the definition of poor professional performance in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and is followed in the other health professional regulatory Acts.

In 2008, the HSE introduced a requirement that consultants be registered on the specialist division of the Medical Council register.  Consultants appointed prior to 2008 under the standard recruitment arrangements in place for the filling of consultant posts at the time did not have to be registered in this division.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 included a provision allowing a five-year period for which the council could grant registration to any medical practitioner who, being able to be registered in the general division, satisfied the council he or she had obtained sufficient training and experience such as he or she should be registered as a specialist on that list.<\/p><p>A small number of consultants appointed prior to 2008 did not avail themselves of this provision.

This window of registration will be available for one year from the commencement of the relevant section of the Bill.<\/p><p>The amendment also provides that within this timeframe, and for the purposes of the above provision, the Medical Council will work with specialist training bodies to assist medical practitioners registered in the general division to achieve the necessary standard for registration in the specialist division.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#L04700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I will not repeat what I said earlier.

The people concerned need to work with the Medical Council to have this additional layer of qualifications.

This provision gives them the opportunity to obtain the additional qualifications.  It is about the difference between the qualifications of and the training and experience of people in the field.

Will the Medical Council have a role in reviewing their experiential learning, or other forms of training undertaken in the course of their duties, with a view to deeming it to be the equivalent of a qualification?  The issue is whether a person is not only capable but also qualified.  The Minister of State is seeking to change whether a person can be admitted to the specialist register.  I have a particular interest in this issue which I have raised on countless occasions.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is saying the people concerned will not practice as a consultant by virtue of their legal entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration.  I might be reading this incorrectly, but I believe such persons could do so.  There is nothing to prohibit it.  Currently, a person can work and be paid as a consultant without the necessary qualifications for admission to the specialist register.

There is no question about their qualifications, but they did not avail of the opportunity in the five-year period.  It is not that they were not eligible but just that they did not avail of the opportunity to do so within the five-year period.  With this provision, we are seeking to open the window again.  The specialist register was introduced under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and there was a five-year window for registration.  Some 30 to 40 consultants who are in post did not avail of that opportunity.  They have continued in post and are still not on the specialist register.  This provision allows them an opportunity to apply for inclusion in the register.  It does not reduce the requirements they have to meet, which is the Deputies&rsquo; concern.  It does not diminish in any way, shape or form the requirement to have the necessary training, experience and qualifications.

The five-year window allowed for that.  The people involved were perfectly qualified, trained and experienced but to get on the specialist register, they may have needed to complete a course or to add another layer.  I am not a medical expert so I do not know what is involved but they may have needed an additional layer.  They may have needed to undergo additional training, as is the case in many areas, in terms of continuous professional development because standards are being raised all the time.

Is the Minister of State certain that we are only talking about that group of between 30 and 40 people?  It seems a little broader and appears to include people who are not in that group.  We are talking here about people who could have but who did not, for various reasons including maternity leave, sick leave or study abroad, apply to be included on the specialist register.  It is limited to that group and there is nobody who would fall outside of the scope of that group who could benefit from this.  Is that correct?  I am happy to take the Minister of State's word on that but my reading of it is that it is sufficiently open-ended to benefit people who are not in that small group of 30 to 40 people.  We are talking about people who, between 2008 and 2013, would have had the opportunity to go on the specialist register but did not do so.  My reading of this is that people who are not in that tight little group could benefit from it and could get themselves onto the specialist register.

They may have to work with the Medical Council on some level but provided they do that, they are perfectly entitled to be on the register.  The Medical Council will continue to uphold standards.  This legislation will not diminish in any way the standard of consultants in this country.  This is just about addressing anomalies.

Could they not do what the group of 30 to 40 practitioners can do, which is to go to the Medical Council and ask for recognition for their work?  These people are acting as consultants.  All of their experience since taking up their acting post is relevant.  Whether they have a contract of indefinite duration or not is irrelevant; they are still acting.  Are they not entitled to the benefit of this legislation?  Would it be deemed unfair if this Bill goes through as is?

This has caused operational problems for the regulator and, in some cases, has lengthened the time it takes for an inquiry to conclude.  This section removes this requirement.  Since the Bill was published, concerns were raised that the section, as drafted, might have unintended consequences for the composition of committees.  Specific concerns were that neither a nurse nor a midwife might be required to sit on a committee and that a nurse might not sit on a committee inquiring into a nurse or a midwife for a midwife.  Following further consideration and discussion with the regulator and the OPC, it is agreed that these concerns would be addressed by the removal of paragraph (11A)(a) in subsection (<i>c<\/i>) of section 129 and this amendment has been drafted accordingly.<\/p><p>When applied to the Bill and the existing Act, the net effect of the amendment is that there will be no change to the PPC and there will continue to be at least one nurse and one midwife on a preliminary proceedings committee and any subcommittee.  There will be a change to the fitness to practise committee for inquiries and, beginning after the section comes into effect, there will be at least one nurse or one midwife on a fitness to practise committee or subcommittee and, where a nurse is being inquired into, a nurse must be on the committee and likewise for a midwife.<\/p><p>This amendment also introduces another key feature, which will assist the NMBI to process complaints more quickly.  The Bill, as drafted, provides that the new streamlined committee structures will apply only to inquiries into complaints made after this section comes into effect.  However, the amendment provides that the new provisions relating to fitness to practise composition will apply to complaints currently being examined but which have not yet reached the fitness to practise hearing stage, which is when a midwife or nurse would be included, as well as to the complaints made after the section has come into effect.  These hearings are held towards the end of the inquiry and this amendment will, therefore, allow a large batch of complaints currently at the early or middle stages of investigation to be heard by the streamlined committee structure.  Concluding these hearings as quickly as possible is in the interest of both the registrant and the complainant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#P01300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>My concern is that a nurse will be adjudicating on a case involving a midwife and vice versa.

When it is granted it predominantly involves cases where there is a relevant medical disability.  My opposition arises from the fact that, if it has to go to court and there is misconduct arising from a disability - most probably a mental health issue - this will form part of the admonishment or censure and it will be read out in open court.  A person may take a compassionate view of professional misconduct or poor professional practice and, at the moment, the fitness to practise committee can use its discretion to hold back information from the public out of concern for a person's mental health, but this facility will be abolished by virtue of the admonishment containing elements of the disability, which will then be confirmed by the court and go on the public record.

The Minister is currently the competent authority for these professions.  The amendment being moved allows the Minister, by order, to designate the HSE as a competent authority for those professions for which it sets the qualifications required for the pursuit of that profession in the publicly funded health sector and which will not be subject to statutory regulation by CORU.  The professions which currently come within the scope of the directive are those of audiologist and environmental health officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019092500002#Q02300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Section 168 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Section 169 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569366000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1569366000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I want to flag that the Minister may wish to make a further amendment on Report Stage.
