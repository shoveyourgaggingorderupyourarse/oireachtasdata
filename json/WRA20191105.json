However, prior to the making of such an order, and not later than 30 October 2019,  the Act requires that I review the operation and effectiveness of the SHD arrangements and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report of my conclusions of the review.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, a Strategic Housing Development Review Group was established in June 2019. The Report of the Review Group was received on 24 September 2019.

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":42,"content":"<p>Question No. 44 answered with Question No. 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":43,"content":"<p>Question No. 45 answered with Question No. 43.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[44983\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will report on the housing first programme; the number of housing first tenancies; the locations it has been rolled out; his plans to extend it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  The National Implementation Plan for Housing First, published in September 2018, extends the delivery of Housing First nationally, with the introduction of targets for each local authority.

Looking at it another way, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new build local authority home for those 90,000 households. <\/p><p>The review of Current and Capital Expenditure on Social Housing Delivery Mechanisms, prepared by the Irish Government Economic &amp;amp; Evaluation Service (IGEES) and published earlier this summer, focussed on an examination of the housing supports provided through capital and current funding mechanisms, the trends and cost developments in housing expenditure and also considered broader issues relevant to overall housing policy development.<\/p><p>In examining the overall blend of housing delivery mechanisms, the review recognised that, in addition to cost factors, there are a range of other factors, which need to be considered in terms of housing delivery, including flexibility and speed of delivery to meet immediate housing need. <\/p><p>Addressing increased social housing need and delivering the greatest number of social housing supports at this time has required the development and implementation of a range of flexible and innovative mechanisms, which take account of available resources and market conditions.  Harnessing private investment remains an important element in the overall delivery of social housing, including through supporting local authorities in meeting the needs of households on their waiting lists.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the cost comparisons set out in the review, it remains the case that it would not be possible to deliver the same number of social housing homes in higher value rental areas exclusively through capital funded build and acquisition programmes.  This will continue to be an important consideration in the context of the future availability of capital funding and the resourcing and capacity required to escalate local authority build and acquisition programmes to the level required to meet the current level of social housing need. <\/p><p>Indeed of the 50,000 new social housing homes which will be added through Rebuilding Ireland, 33,500 of these will be built with the remainder acquired. A further 10,000 homes will be leased under long term leasing arrangements. <\/p><p>Clearly, it is important at this time that a blended approach to the delivery of social housing homes is pursued in order to deliver and provide immediate housing supports to those households on local authority waiting lists across the country whilst simultaneously ratcheting up capacity year on year within the housing stock. This approach is supported by the findings of the IGEES review, which supports the need for a blended approach to delivery. <\/p><p>The housing crisis is complex in nature and requires a flexible, innovative response. In each year of Rebuilding Ireland to date outputs have exceeded targets and in doing so we are, step by step, resolving these issues and putting in foundations of a sustainable housing future for this country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":54,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 43.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[41989\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the marine planning and development management Bill.","asker":"1294","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>Government approved a General Scheme of the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill in July 2019.

The monthly report is based on data provided by housing authorities on a regional basis and produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).  The report captures details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.  The most recent report is for September 2019 which showed that there were 1,756 families with 3,873 associated dependants in emergency accommodation in that month.  <\/p>  <p>  Supporting families experiencing homelessness is a priority for this Government. In 2016, the Government published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  Rebuilding Ireland is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively. Over 27,000 households had their housing need met under Rebuilding Ireland in 2018, with the local authority stock of social housing increased by 8,000, including homes built by local authorities and by Approved Housing Bodies. In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has increased funding available to local authorities to provide homeless accommodation and related services to &euro;166m, an increase of &euro;20m on this year&rsquo;s budget. While the priority is to support families to secure a home, the Government is also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is available until a home can be provided.  In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation.  <\/p>  <p>  This funding also supports the delivery of services to prevent families having to enter emergency accommodation and to ensure that those families in emergency accommodation are supported to identify and secure an independent tenancy within the shortest possible time frame.  The HAP Placefinder service has been made available to all local authorities to support households experiencing homelessness or at risk if entering into homelessness, to identify and secure a tenancy in the private rented sector. My Department has approved funding for 23 Placefinder officers nationally. <\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering significant results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  I expect that the numbers of exits from homelessness will increase again in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Further work is being done to prevent families from presenting to homeless services.  To strengthen further the rights of tenants in the private rented sector, building on initiatives already taken, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 was signed into law in May 2019.  Among the key provisions of the Bill are measures to empower the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct including non-compliance with rent increase restrictions in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs); the creation of criminal offences for landlords connected with non-compliance with rent increase restrictions in RPZs; and increasing notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords. In addition, there are now Rent Pressure Zones in 42 areas nationally, in which rent increases are limited to 4 % p.a., and the operation of which has been strengthened further under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Lending","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB06900"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[45196\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB07000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the timeframe for the review group on establishing a special purpose vehicle to enable credit union funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the potential role that credit unions can play in housing finance and supported the efforts of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing.<\/p>  <p>  Credit Union bodies have set out proposed means by which funding could be provided by Credit Unions to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the development of social housing.

This flexible and responsive approach is the hallmark of Rebuilding Ireland and it is working. <\/p>  <p>  This year we will deliver more than 10,000 new social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing mechanisms across the country. Next year this figure will be in excess of 11,000. To put this into context, this would represent an almost 100% increase on the delivery of social homes in just four years, compared with the delivery of 5,714 homes through the same mechanisms in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's National Development Plan 2018-2027, sets out the Government's  commitment to deliver 112,000 social housing homes out to 2027, supported by capital funding of &euro;11.6 billion. <\/p>  <p>  This progress is having a tangible affect on the lives of thousands of households and the most recently available Summary of Social Housing Assessments indicated that the number of households on the social housing waiting list has decreased by 25%.   <\/p>  <p>  However, we must also ensure that we meet the housing needs of families and individuals in the short term. At the end of Quarter 2 of 2019, almost sixty thousand households (59,961) have been supported through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme since the start of Rebuilding Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  These supports are vital and provide security to households and enables them to remain in their homes, under the rights afforded by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), until such time as they move onto either a social home with a local authority or Approved Housing Body or alternatively into the private market, facilitated by additional measures, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have helped address the housing needs of some 15,000 households.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of affordable housing, either to buy or rent, is being facilitated by the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) that runs from 2019 to 2021. The fund is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable discounted homes can be delivered and I envisage that at least 6,200 affordable homes can be provided through this mechanism. Approval in principle has been granted for funding of approximately &euro;127 million, to support almost 3,200 homes.  While more focused on urban areas, and building at scale on local authority sites, the fund remains in place for the provision of housing in all locations where there is a proven affordability challenge.  It is anticipated that further calls under the Serviced Sites Fund will be made in due course.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) was designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand. Funding of &euro;200 million was originally made available under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million would be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities to match fund &euro;50 million. 30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance. These projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities and approximately 7,800 of these homes will be offered a discount on open market prices. To date, according to information provided by Local Authorities, 1,678 housing units have been delivered including 785 cost reduced units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB07500"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[44981\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500060#WRB07600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of local authorities that have developed and activated vacant homes action plans; the statistical information his Department has on the number of vacant homes in each local authority area; the action that has been advised to local authorities in respect of homes left vacant for long periods of time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>Every local authority has prepared a Vacant Homes Action Plan for their administrative area.

Local authorities are also working hard to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties.

The purpose of this office is to accelerate and monitor housing delivery, both private and social, on key sites, identify further mechanisms to accelerate delivery, and support the roll-out of complex construction projects, including identifying and resolving barriers to delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency (LDA) was also established in September 2018 with an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. On establishment, the Agency had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites  that have near term delivery potential for 3,000 new homes. The overall objective is for the LDA to be involved in the building of 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. <\/p>  <p>  Extensive consultation has taken place and is ongoing between the Land Development Agency (LDA) and local authorities. The discussions have centred around how the LDA can assist with the formulation of plans to deliver housing, including social and affordable housing, on local authority owned lands.

years from 2009 to 31 October, 2019.<\/p><p>The Deputy will note from that the overall staffing numbers in the Department of Defence have decreased by some 14%; from 409 at the end of 2008, to a figure of 352 at 31 October, 2019. As outlined in the table, while the overall numbers have declined the profile of the posts has changed somewhat to reflect the evolving policy based issues for the defence sector, both national and international, increased activity in areas such as HR and procurement, governance and supporting engagement with the Oireachtas. In addition, the transfer of a number of transactional HR and payroll functions, involving predominantly clerical grades, to the National Shared Services Office has also impacted on the required skills and workforce profile of my Department.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department comprises of both a civil and a military element. The civil element is headed by the Secretary General and the military element by the Chief of Staff. Both elements provide support to me as Minister in the management of defence. Defence Forces' Headquarters is the military element of the Department, with an establishment of over 320 military personnel.  <\/p><p>Civil-military collaboration in the Department enables the delivery of defence across the three strategic dimensions set out in the Statement of Strategy; defence policy, ensuring the capacity to deliver and Defence Forces' operational outputs. Also, the White Paper on Defence, which provides the policy framework for defence to 2025, is being implemented through a project management framework built on civil-military collaboration.  A number of additional civil servants have been assigned directly to work within military units to provide specialist skills and expertise in key areas such as finance, procurement and analysis.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Defence continues to play an important role in the areas of Civil Defence, Emergency Planning, enterprise development and societal supports and I am

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. I am also aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  <\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. When planning for the March 2020 Human Rights Council session, we will consider carefully which priorities to set, with a view to focusing the weight of Ireland's efforts, and the Council's attention, on the most grave and troubling situations globally. <\/p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly in New York in September, I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rebates","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[44670\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason for the introduction of a &euro;175 retail export scheme threshold in view of the warning from F&aacute;ilte Ireland that at least 10,000 tourism sector jobs are at risk in a no-deal Brexit scenario; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>The Retail Export Scheme allows persons who are resident outside the EU and who make purchases of goods in the EU to avail of a refund of the VAT charged on these goods where the goods are exported from the EU by the tourist or traveller within three months of purchase.

Paragraph 15 of the Regulations provides that where a vehicle is sold, or otherwise disposed of, or ceases to be used to transport <i>&lsquo;the person with disabilities&rsquo;<\/i>within two years, a portion of the refund\/remission is to be repaid to Revenue.<\/p><p>The Regulations also provide a formula, based on the open market selling price (OMSP) of the vehicle at the time of disposal, which can be used by Revenue to calculate the amount that should be repaid where the vehicle ceases to be used to transport <i>&lsquo;the person with disabilities&rsquo;<\/i>within the two-year period. The formula takes account of any depreciation to the vehicle on foot of an accident or damage once supporting insurance or salvage documentation is made available. In situations where the OMSP and relevant supporting documentation is not provided, Revenue seeks repayment at rates of 100% if the vehicle is removed from the Scheme within the first 6 months, 90% if removed between 6 and 12 months and 80% if removed between 13 and 24 months. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the person in question made an online application to bring a new vehicle onto the Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities Scheme in July 2019.

It was submitted to me for consideration in September 2017, in advance of its publication on Budget Day, 10 October 2017. The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. <\/p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Earlier this year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[44275\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for an economic impact assessment of the current withdrawal treaty on trade and other economic metrics under the auspices of his Department and agencies under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[44306\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has met the ESRI recently to discuss the economic impact of the current withdrawal treaty on Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[44307\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is assessing independently or otherwise the economic losses that Ireland is exposed to under the current withdrawal treaty if it is accepted in particular its impact on east-west trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[44540\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to provide an updated economic impact assessment of Brexit on Ireland based on the most recent withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 121, inclusive, and 129 together.<\/p><p>Budget 2020, including the macroeconomic outlook which underpins it, was based on the prudent assumption that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October without an agreement. The macroeconomic outlook is set out in the <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook<\/i>published with Budget 2020. This included, at Box 4, an assessment of the macroeconomic outlook that would apply in the event of an agreed exit by the UK at end October. <\/p><p>The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the UK Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020. <\/p><p>If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a transition period until at least the end of 2020. In this situation the outlook would be broadly similar to that set out in Table 4 (Box 4) in the <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2020. <\/i>This shows that, in the event of an agreed exit, GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1 per cent in 2020, with employment growth projected at 1.7 per cent next year and the unemployment rate expected to be 5.1 per cent. <\/p><p>The revised Political Declaration envisages an ambitious trading relationship for goods on the basis of a Free Trade Agreement, but until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment. My Department has been in contact with the ESRI on the economic impact of the revised Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future relationship. I am satisfied that the existing analysis in the joint research by the Department of Finance and ESRI, published in March this year, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships. The analysis included a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), and a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research with was published in March this year. <\/p><p>Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities.<\/p><p>In 2017, my Department published a paper on trade exposures which shows that, relative to other EU Member States, Irish exports are substantially more exposed to the UK in a number of goods sectors. The top five most exposed included the Irish agri-food sub-sectors Cereals, Vegetables and Fruit, and Live Animal products. In services, Ireland is in the upper range of the most exposed EU Member States, particularly in Financial Services. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring of next year at the latest. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Data","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE04000"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[44330\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland external review report 2019; the cost of same; the firm that produced the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution.

There is a maximum rebate of 7.5 cents per litre when the retail price is &euro;1.25 (Vat exclusive) or above.   <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges facing the road haulage sector due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, I announced in my Budget 2020 speech that the DRS is being enhanced. The detail of this is set out in Finance Bill 2019. In brief, the price floor of &euro;1.00 (Vat exclusive) will remain the same; the marginal rebate rate will double at a price point of &euro;1.07 or above; the maximum rebate amount will remain at 7.5 cents per litre; and the amended DRS will apply to fuel purchased by qualifying operators from 1st January 2020. <\/p>  <p>  This represents a significant enhancement of the terms of the DRS. By way of example, the current average price of a litre of diesel is &euro;1.093 (Vat exclusive), which if used as the average price under the current DRS would entitle qualifying operators to a rebate of 2.8c per litre. Under the enhanced DRS, qualifying operators would be entitled to a rebate of 4.4c if an average per litre price of &euro;1.109 (Vat exclusive) were to be used as the basis for calculating the rebate. In other words, in the example outlined above, an additional 1.6c to the average price of a litre of diesel would be matched by the additional rebate amount. More generally, at a price point of &euro;1.16 (Vat exclusive), the rebate amount under the enhanced DRS is 7.5c per litre which is 2.7c per litre more than the rebate amount that would be paid under the current DRS.       <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that this scheme is a fossil fuel subsidy which the ESRI has found is directly increasing CO2 emissions (as well as non CO2 emissions).

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices, and there were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope.<\/p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. <\/p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. In total, 121 submissions were received. This included submissions from individuals, businesses, lobby groups and a political party. The results of the consultation were included in the recently published Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT. The options set out in the TSG paper are the only options available; either the standard rate is maintained, or the reduced rate is introduced.<\/p>  <p>  I am making provision in Finance Bill 2019 to apply the 13.5% rate of VAT to all food supplement products, which will take effect from 1 January 2020. This measure is expected to be cost neutral. The food supplement industry is relatively small in Ireland (approx. &euro;60 million) and the loss to the Exchequer incurred as a result of the lowering of the rate for products currently liable to the standard rate of VAT (23%), should be offset by the increase to products that previously were concessionally zero rated. <\/p>  <p>  Foods for specific groups such as infant follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods (e.g. total diet replacement for weight control) will remain zero rated. These are well established and defined categories of food that are essential for vulnerable groups of the population. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also remain zero rated as they are food.<\/p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral products for human oral use which are licensed or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;) will remain zero rated under a different VAT provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Measures","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE06000"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[44511\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500063#WRE06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures included in the Finance Bill 2019 that will result in additional revenue for the Exchequer in 2020 that were not announced on budget day, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>As usual, there are a number of measures in the Finance Bill 2019 that were not announced on Budget day.

Failure to submit an LPT return or submission of an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a self-employed person is penalised for the late submission (or non-submission) of an income tax return by the imposition of a surcharge on his or her income tax liability. However, a self-employed person who has submitted his or her income tax return on time can also be liable to an income tax surcharge in respect of the late submission of his or her LPT return or the failure to pay LPT.  Where such a person has not submitted his or her LPT return by the time that he or she submits an income tax return, the income tax liability is increased by 10% up to a maximum increase of &euro;63,485.  However, where the LPT return is subsequently submitted and the associated LPT liability is paid, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a similar type surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit an LPT return on time. While PAYE taxpayers and self-employed taxpayers are treated the same in terms of the amount of their LPT liability, the same treatment is not necessary, and not always possible, in relation to how Revenue addresses non-compliance by such taxpayers.  Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to collect LPT liabilities through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension, which is considered to be a fair approach in the context of the surcharge on income tax that can apply to self-employed taxpayers who fail to meet their LPT liabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time.

Details are on www.nama.ie\/publications\/annual-reports\/Please   note that the use of derogations under NAMA&rsquo;s procurement policies does not amount to non-compliant procurement.<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Office of the Revenue Commissioners<\/td>       <td>2017:The Appropriation Account for 2017 states that the report on procurements in 2017 without competitive tendering amounted to &euro;1,676,644.  However, none of these were classed as   non-compliant with procurement guidelines by the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General. 2018:Details of procurement determined by the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General as non-compliant with procurement guidelines in 2018 are set out below:<br \/><br \/>&euro;527,000 relating to long standing contracts for telephonist services. Revenue has phased out the use of external telephonists with the outstanding contracts having been ceased with effect from September 30th, 2019.<br \/><br \/>The following items were all originally tendered for, but the contracts were rolled over pending new tendering processes:<br \/><br \/>&euro;2.141 million relating to security contracts. The delay in running mini competitions under a new Office of Government Procurement (OGP) framework arose due to the time required to assess requirements on a national basis across multiple locations. New contracts were put in place in December 2018.<br \/><br \/>&euro;1.037 million relating to warehousing contracts. A tender competition was held in 2018 by the OGP for a contract to manage the State Warehouse. The OGP tendering process was unsuccessful in   appointing a supplier and a new tender competition, run by Revenue, was successfully concluded and a new contract was in place on May 1st, 2019.<br \/><br \/>&euro;765,000 relating to various services including, inter alia, mobile telephony and fuel cards. Revenue is liaising with OGP with a view to utilising new and existing OGP frameworks and conducting procurement processes where necessary.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>2019:<br \/><br \/>The following relate to expenditure in 2019 for rollover contracts identified by the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General in the 2018 report as non-compliant with procurement guidelines. These are the only contracts that can be currently identified as non-compliant for 2019. The definitive 2019 position can only be determined in the New Year following review by the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General. <br \/><br \/>&euro;207K relates to telephonist services. The contracts were terminated on September 30th.<br \/><br \/>&euro;285K relates to the State Warehouse contracted which was replaced on May 1st.<br \/><br \/>&euro;649K relates to various services including mobile telephony and fuel cards running on old contracts (&euro;584k and &euro;65k respectively).<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tax Appeals Commission<\/td>       <td>2017: Nil 2018: A contract to the value of &euro;33,000 for software and hardware for a voice recognition and dictation system was non-compliant because it was entered into without there first being a competitive process; this took place because there was no comparable product in the market of which the Tax Appeals Commission had previous experience and practical knowledge.

The pricing of insurance products is a commercial matter for insurers and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any function in this matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the leisure sector.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to emphasise however that the cost of insurance  remains a priority issue for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and has produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report<\/i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report<\/i>.  The latter report in particular makes it clear the impact that the cost of insurance is having on the leisure and other sectors and this position has been reinforced by Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s continuing engagement with the sector. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on the leisure sector and there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge which must be addressed if we are to overcome it is a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. <\/p><p>In this regard, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced. This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.<\/p><p>Other steps take to date to address the cost of insurance include the following: <\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 <\/i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance;<\/p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;<\/p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a result of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the insurance premium and coverage issues that are being experienced by the leisure sector and many businesses more generally should recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500064#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":327,"content":"<p>Question No. 147 answered with Question No. 126.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Data","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500064#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[45290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500064#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons eligible for the e-working and home workers tax relief on expenses incurred while working from home; the number of eligible persons that made a claim under the relief in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the value of all valid claims made under this relief annually over the period by county and nationwide; the estimated value for eligible persons that did not make a claim under the relief in each year by county and nationwide in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>Employers may make payments of up to &euro;3.20 per work-day to e-worker or home worker employees to cover expenses such as heating and electricity, which are not subject to deduction of PAYE, PRSI or USC. <\/p>  <p>   I am advised that where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and therefore the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available.

The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers and currently has 6 on-lenders, 3 bank and 3 non-bank finance providers: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Finance Ireland Limited, Bibby Financial Services Ireland, and FEXCO Asset Finance. <\/p><p>During 2018, 91% of SBCI loans went to firms outside Dublin, with 19.5% going to the South West, 10.9% to the South East, 17% to the Mid-West, 11.8% to the West, 12.7% to the Border, 7.4% to the Midlands and 11.7% to the Mid-East. <\/p><p>The table below shows the level of employment in businesses that received SBCI supported loans by county and region from March 2015 to end Q3 2019: <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>No. of Jobs<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>2,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>3,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>3,100<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>20,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>3,700<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>49,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway<\/td>       <td>11,100<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>7,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>13,300<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>2,900<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>1,800<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>800<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>5,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>800<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>3,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>5,900<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>6,400<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>2,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>1,900<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>2,300<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>1,900<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>7,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>3,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>2,700<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>6,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>3,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>172,100 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Region<\/th>       <th>No. of Jobs<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Border<\/td>       <td>15,100<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>49,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-East<\/td>       <td>23,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-West<\/td>       <td>16,100<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Midland<\/td>       <td>7,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South-East<\/td>       <td>14,800<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South-West<\/td>       <td>27,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>West<\/td>       <td>19,300<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[45471\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when further measures as proposed by the cost of insurance working group will be implemented due to the widespread concerns across sectors regarding the prohibitive cost of insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>At the outset, as the Deputy is aware neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided either to consumers or to businesses.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore there is unfortunately no quick fix solution to this matter.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to emphasise however that the cost of insurance remains a priority issue for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report<\/i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.<\/i>Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed. To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports include the following:  <\/p><p>- The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time. This showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales; <\/p><p>- The enactment of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>;<\/p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform. It is expected that the LRC will launch a public consultation into the matter shortly;<\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019;  <\/p><p>-  Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected; <\/p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; and,<\/p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.  <\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses. <\/p><p>Going forward, some actions which are due in the coming months include the following:<\/p><p>- The establishment of the Judicial Council and the creation of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee whose purpose will to create new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; <\/p><p>- The CSO is shortly to make a recommendation related to the feasibility of establishing a price register for insurance costs to businesses;<\/p><p>- The CBI will  make a recommendation to me before the end of the year regarding potentially expanding the scope of the National Claims Information Database to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p><p>- The private member's <i>Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill<\/i>is scheduled to progress through the Oireachtas. The Government proposed committee stage amendments, which, inter alia, included requirements for insurers to inform policy holders, including small businesses, in circumstances where a claim has been made against them;<\/p><p>- Work is continuing on the establishment of a fraud database. However, significant data protection concerns need to be addressed before other issues (such as the governance or location of such a database) can be decided upon; and,<\/p><p>- The CIWG is waiting draft Heads from the Department of Justice in relation to Pre-Action Protocols, which have been shown to reduce legal costs in relation to personal injury claims in the UK.<\/p><p>I believe it is important to emphasise that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. In this regard, the work of the soon to be created Personal Injures Guidelines Committee will be essential in achieving that objective. As the Deputy will be aware, this is not an area that the Government can intervene in, however it is hoped that the Judiciary recognise the importance of this work and prioritise it accordingly.  <\/p><p>In addition and in light of all of the reforms that have taken place or are soon to take place, my colleague, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, has been engaging with insurers in order to seek a commitment that they will reduce premiums and widen their risk appetite to reflect savings made or potential savings in the coming years, in particular if there is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  In this regard, I am encouraged by the comments made by a number of insurers at the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach Oireachtas Committee in July about the passing on of savings arising from a recalibration of award levels downwards.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations including a reduction in award levels will lead to reductions in pricing in particular for small businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[45133\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans for the former Garda station at MacCurtain Street in Cork city.","asker":"1276","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The official closure of the Garda station at MacCurtain St Cork was announced in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s 2013 Policing Plan.

Donegal is open to visitors daily throughout the year (opening times vary seasonally).  A public carpark, owned by Donegal Co. Council, is available during opening hours and this gives visitors direct access to a universally accessible boardwalk leading to the Monument itself a short distance away.  Basic interpretation is provided in the form of information panels located conveniently at the site.  OPW employs a local caretaker \/ keyholder to manage the opening and closing of the carpark and maintains visitor data electronically at the site.  The data available indicates that 90,435 visitors were recorded in 2018.  This level of usage by the public suggests that there is considerable interest in An Grian&aacute;n as an attraction and it is popular with both domestic and foreign visitors. However, it is also clear that the volume of footfall and the unregulated and unsupervised nature of the traffic presents significant conservation risks at the site.  Currently, OPW staff are being called on regularly during the summer period in particular to repair physical damage done to the Monument and to clean the site from the after effects of antisocial behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Understanding that the site exhibits considerable tourism potential, OPW has raised with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht the possibility of some level of visitor infrastructure being provided which would enhance the experience and provide a control mechanism that would assist in the sustainable management of visitors. OPW has also met with interested parties locally, including Donegal Co. Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and has suggested that collaboration between the various public agencies that focusses particularly on those that own potential development land near the Monument should be explored.   <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist with the process of identifying possible ways to improving provision for visitors to the site, OPW early in 2019 commissioned a specialist consultant to develop a Conservation and Management Plan for Grian&aacute;n an Aileach and this work is currently underway.  The OPW has, in the context of the discussions held with public partners, left open the question of the future management and staffing of the site.  Without suitable infrastructure currently, there is no suitable location to house staff and to provide a Guide service would not be feasible in advance of any facilities being built and a decision made as to who should operate the facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Data","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[44388\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500065#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the most recent visitor numbers at each OPW site in County Donegal that is open to the public.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>The most recent visitor numbers available are for 2018.

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019\/20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). <\/p>  <p>  The Council has well established structures in place to plan and coordinate special education provision throughout the country.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries, and schools with enrolments of 626-699 will be permitted to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two posts filled. These measures will take effect from September 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  <\/p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500068#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500068#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[44532\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500068#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to reform the July provision scheme for children with special needs; if the scheme will be extended to cater for children with Down's syndrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>My Departments July Provision Scheme provides funding for an extended school year for students with severe or profound intellectual disabilities and students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). <\/p><p>The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special education needs over the summer holidays. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which advises me on these matters published its Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism in July 2016 which included a review of the July Scheme.<\/p><p>The review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides day-time respite for families and a structured day for students.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries, and schools with enrolments of 626-699 will be permitted to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two posts filled. These measures will take effect from September 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  <\/p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500069#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500069#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[44664\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500069#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the timeline of required actions to facilitate the opening of a new secondary school for the Greystones and Kilcoole area of County Wicklow by the planned date of September 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>My Department is currently examining options for interim accommodation to facilitate the opening of this school in September 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500069#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology","counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500069#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[44709\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500069#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of computers in his Department that still use an operating system (details supplied) in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>My Department has been upgrading computers from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and is expecting to complete this task by January 2020.

The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process. Following a referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship. As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004. The changes came into effect on 1st January 2005. As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not, at birth, have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that there are some cases of young people who have grown up here but who, as a result of their parents' illegal status, find themselves in a difficult situation. However, it is important to emphasise, that when it comes to people living here illegally, the only option for regularisation is on a case by case basis.   Inevitably, granting permission to children and young people who reside in Ireland in an undocumented capacity will require that other family members must also be allowed to remain in order to care for and support the children. However, where people who have had an application for residence refused or who simply overstay their permission to reside in this country and do not apply for an extension to their permission, the State must be allowed to exercise its legal right to remove them from the State.  It would be unwise to permit people to simply ignore our immigration laws and allow them and their families to remain here merely on the basis of the length of time that they have resided here without permission.  <\/p>  <p>  I am, however, open to exploring all legal solutions to the issue of children who have grown up here in circumstances where they or their family are undocumented. I met with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland (MRCI) in June to discuss the situation and my Department has on-going engagement with MRCI and other NGOs on this matter.   <\/p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact the Immigration Service of my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their family's status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500072#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Inquiries","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500072#WRO01900"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[44332\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500072#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a scoping exercise in a case (details supplied); if terms of reference regarding an inquiry have been changed; his views on the terms of reference as they were put to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>The circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell have previously been addressed by me in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and I have met with the O'Farrell family.  <\/p><p>Following the D&aacute;il motion calling for a public inquiry last year, I sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed, given the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was still investigating certain matters in relation to the case.Following the conclusion of the GSOC investigation, I appointed retired District Court Judge Gerard Haughton to conduct a scoping exercise into the circumstances leading to Shane's tragic death.<\/p><p>I am grateful to Judge Haughton for agreeing to undertake this sensitive and important work.<\/p><p>Judge Haughton subsequently met with the O'Farrell family to discuss the terms of reference and to seek their views.

This review is one part of a suite of measures which will include the development of new legislation on both hate speech and hate crime.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review, I launched a public consultation process on 24 October which is open and inviting submissions until 13 December 2019 and will gather the views of communities, experts and all interested persons on how our incitement legislation should be changed to make it fit for purpose. Details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the questions in the consultation include: what limits it is appropriate to place on freedom of expression when it comes to hate speech; what forms of hate speech are serious enough that they should be a criminal offence; whether the list of protected characteristics included in the legislation should be changed; whether the existing legislation is adequate to deal with online communications, and whether the need to prove the intent or likelihood or stirring up hatred should be altered. <\/p>  <p>  Separately to the work on incitement, my Department is finalising research on the effectiveness of the different legislative approaches to tackling hate crime in other countries, in order to learn from experience elsewhere and use this information to identify the approach that will be most suitable for Ireland. When this research has concluded I will bring forward proposals for new hate crime legislation. These will be published and the views of experts, communities and the public will be taken into account to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500073#WRP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Data","counter":815,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500073#WRP02500"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[44644\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500073#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way in which funds for the free legal aid service are distributed nationally by law centre in each of the past four years; the criteria in place to determine the distribution of funding; the precise weighting given to each criteria; the plan in place to target resources at areas with the longest waiting times or other measures of need; and the waiting times and numbers for first and second consultations by each law centre.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>The Legal Aid Board is the statutory independent body responsible for the provision of civil legal aid and advice to persons of modest means in the State.  The Board also has responsibility to provide a family mediation service. <\/p><p>I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board on behalf of the Deputy and they have provided the following information.<\/p><p>Civil legal aid and advice is provided primarily by solicitors employed by the Board through a network of law centres . There are 30 full time and 12 part-time law centres.  Specific law centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway include an international protection speciality and there are also dedicated units in Dublin dealing with personal injury and\/or medical negligence cases and cases involving children at risk.  Family mediation services are provided through 8 full time offices and 9 part time offices.<\/p><p>The Board also engages private solicitors to supplement the services provided by Board solicitors in certain areas of law on a case by case basis, those areas of law being; District Court family law matters, Circuit Court judicial separation and divorce cases, international protection cases, and cases on foot of the Abhaile scheme.<\/p><p>I am advised that the Board does not have to hand a breakdown of the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office\/county in a given year. It should be borne in mind that applicants are free to apply for legal services to any law centre and are not bound to apply in their county of residence. Furthermore, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county.<\/p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from my Department. This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all its offices across the country, as well as the support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's head office.  The Board&rsquo;s other main sources of income are financial contributions from applicants and costs recovered.<\/p><p>The grant funding provided to the Legal Aid Board by my Department in 2019 is &euro;40.796 million.  The largest cost of operating the law centre network is staff salaries. Solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board are civil servants of the State and are subject to the standard civil service terms and conditions of employment and are employed on standard civil service pay scales.  The allocation of staffing resources in the Legal Aid Board is a matter for the Chief Executive and senior management, within its budgetary parameters.<\/p><p>The Board seeks to ensure that a person who qualifies for civil legal aid (legal services) will be offered an appointment with a solicitor within a maximum period of four months from the time the application is completed or will be offered earlier legal advice if it is not possible to provide full legal services within four months. A priority service is provided in certain cases including cases involving domestic violence, child abduction, applications by the State (Tusla) to take children into care or under supervision, and cases that have statutory time limits close to expiry.<\/p><p>The waiting times and numbers for first and second consultation appointments are published on a regular basis on the website of the Legal Aid Board (www.legalaidboard.ie).<\/p><p>As of the 31st December 2016, there were 1,864 persons waiting for legal services which was a reduction from the figure of 2,319 at the start of the year.  At the end of 2017 the number of persons waiting for legal services stood at 1,776.  At the end of 2018 the number of persons waiting for legal services stood at 1,754 (see Table 1). This was the sixth successive year in which there was a decrease (from over 5,000 in 2013).  The number of persons waiting for a first consultation with a Legal Aid Board solicitor stands at 1,933 at the end of October, 2019.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 <\/b>-<b>The number of persons waiting on the 31<\/b><b><sup>st<\/sup><\/b><b>December 2018<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>2013 <\/th>       <th>2014 <\/th>       <th>2015 <\/th>       <th>2016 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number Waiting <\/td>       <td>5,067 <\/td>       <td>3,412 <\/td>       <td>2,319 <\/td>       <td>1,864 <\/td>       <td>1,776 <\/td>       <td>1,754 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The maximum waiting time in weeks, for non prioritised matters, as of the 30<sup>th<\/sup>September, 2019 is set out for the various law centres in Table 2. It must be emphasised that this table gives a snapshot of waiting times at a particular point in time. Waiting times will go up and down depending on demand and on the capacity of each law centre to offer appointments to new clients.  A number of law centres that currently have long waiting lists are being affected by solicitor turnover and other staff movement or absence which the Board is seeking to address. Where capacity permits, applications in Dublin are transferred between law centres to allow earlier first consultation appointments for applicants. The distribution of resources is similarly kept under constant review. I am advised for example that with some redistribution it is expected that the waiting time at the Law Centre in Finglas will drop significantly in the next couple of months.<\/p><p><b>Table 2:

If, after these procedures, an applicant has been found not to be in need of international protection, that person is no longer considered to be an asylum seeker or to be in need of  international protection. <\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) gives the Minister for Justice and Equality powers to make a Deportation Order. Section 3(2) of that Act sets out the nature of persons in respect of whom such an Order can be made. This includes, among other categories of person, a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State, a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence, a person whose application for asylum,  based on the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), has been refused by the Minister and a person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good. <\/p>  <p>  Section 3(3) of the Act provides the procedure to be followed before any such Order can be made while section 3(4) sets out the three options open to any person put on notice of a proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of them. These options are to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit written representations against the making of such an Order.  <\/p>  <p>  A refoulement consideration must also be carried out prior to any deportation consideration. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  No person is returned to their country of origin, or their place of former habitual residence, where there is a credible risk to their life or freedom.  <\/p>  <p>  The data available to the Immigration Service of my Department suggests that the State did not return any individual to Zimbabwe in the years mentioned in the Deputy's query. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500074#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":864,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500074#WRQ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":865,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[44951\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500074#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Gardaassigned to the drugs and organised crime unit in County Louth in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1330","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":866,"content":"<p>The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the managing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation of Garda resources, in light of identified operational demands.

I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.<\/p><p>In 2015 the Commissioner, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country. <\/p><p>The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. <\/p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. <\/p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Where the establishment of a framework is pending, the Department may roll over existing arrangements without a competitive tender process to avoid entering a long-term contract with relatively disadvantageous terms.<\/p>  <p>  Department of Finance Circular 40\/02 requires Government Departments and Offices to submit an annual report to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for contracts above &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) awarded without a competitive process by 31 March of the following year. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that procurement reported under Circular 40\/02 is not inherently non-compliant. Rather, it is the subset of procurement activity for which competitive tendering is not considered appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Details of contracts awarded by my Department without the use of a competitive process are outlined in the Department&rsquo;s Appropriation Accounts for 2017 and 2018.  Work is continuing on compiling similar information for 2019 and this will be published in the 2019 Appropriation Account.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 a determination was made by the Office of the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General that the procurement with respect to eighteen contracts reported under Circular 40\/02 was non-compliant. As set out in the Appropriation Accounts in 2018, these contracts were extended without a competitive process primarily while revised long-term arrangements or OGP frameworks were put in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has reviewed these contracts and is satisfied that while delays in establishing long-term arrangements were regrettable, the consequent decisions to roll over existing contracts were necessary and justified due to the continuing need to maintain the supply of goods or services to clients. <\/p>  <p>  I have requested that relevant agencies under the remit of my Department, and operating under a separate Vote structure (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Irish Prison Service and Courts Service) respond directly to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500075#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":909,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500075#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":910,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[45084\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500075#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the sections and subsections of the Disability Act 2005 that remain uncommenced; and the reason in each case they have not been commenced to date.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":911,"content":"<p>The Disability Act 2005 has been fully commenced with the exception of Part 2 in so far as it relates to persons aged over 5.

In such a situation, the debtor&rsquo;s Personal Insolvency Practitioner can apply to Court under section 115A.  The Court will carefully scrutinise the proposal, and the refusal by creditors, in the light of the statutory criteria set out in section 115A. If the Court is satisfied that those criteria are met, it has power to impose the rejected proposal on creditors, allowing the debtor to return to solvency and, wherever possible, to remain in their home. <\/p><p>Abhaile, the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, provides expert financial and legal advice and help to a borrower in this situation, including legal aid for an application made under section 115A. Over the past 3 years, the Courts have built up an important body of case law on the application of section 115A.  This has greatly clarified the rights and responsibilities of debtors and creditors regarding the resolution of home mortgage arrears - both in section 115A proceedings, and more broadly for those borrowers seeking to negotiate restructure arrangements directly with their lenders with the help of MABS and other agencies. <\/p><p>Subsection section 115A(18)(b) effectively provides that to avail of section 115A, the borrower must have been in arrears on their home mortgage before 1 January 2015, <i>or<\/i>have entered into an alternative repayment arrangement with their mortgage lender (or other secured creditor) before that date. Thus, the section is not limited to persons actually in arrears on 1 January 2015, and also covers a borrower who prior to that date had entered into a long-term interest only alternative repayment arrangement to resolve their arrears.<\/p><p>However, I can assure the Deputy that this is among the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Acts which are under review by my Department: that review is near completion, taking careful account of the submissions made during the public consultation held earlier and of the changing profile of home mortgage arrears since the enactment of the 2015 Act.

As of 25 October 2019, the Dublin Visa Office was processing tourist\/visit visa applications received in Dublin on 1 October 2019.

However, the processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.   <\/p>  <p>  It has not been possible in the time available to ascertain the number of applications awaiting a decision in every processing centre. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.

As recognised in Future Jobs, increasing female participation is a vital way to grow the diversity and strength of our indigenous business sector. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is leading the way in providing a variety of programmes through its agencies to increase the number of women starting businesses and assisting them at every stage, from potential business leaders to women growing their businesses. My Department published the first National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement in 2014. Action 19 of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have been at the forefront of examining the variance in the female to male ratio of start-ups and have put in place measures to address the imbalance. The Competitive Start Fund (CSF) for Female Entrepreneurs aims to support early stage start-ups.  The establishment of this programme has resulted in a spill-over effect with increased female participation in other EI programmes. In 2012, just eight percent of the 97 High-Potential Start Ups (HPSUs) were female-led. However, 22 per cent of HPSU approvals went to female-led companies in 2018 and 22% of CSF approvals were for companies led by female entrepreneurs.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks. An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs and women operating established businesses. In 2018 the network of Local Enterprise Offices across the country provided training to 21,859 female entrepreneurs (an 18% increase on 2017 figures) and mentoring to 4,565 female entrepreneurs (an increase of 19% on 2017 figures).<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the GEM Report for 2018 notes the rate of early stage entrepreneurial activity increased among women in Ireland in 2018 and remained stable for men. The rate of early stage entrepreneurial activity is well above European norm for both men and women in Ireland. In most countries more men than women are early stage entrepreneurs. The ratio in Ireland continues to narrow as more women become entrepreneurs (1.6:1). Ireland is now ranked 6th across Europe in this regard. The rate at which women aspire to start a business in Ireland also increased in 2018. The ratio of male to female owner-managers of established businesses is higher (1.8:1) than it is among early stage entrepreneurs (1.6:1), but the gap is narrowing as the female rate is increasing. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure we do everything to narrow this gap further, my Department and its Agencies continue to shine a light on the promotion of female entrepreneurship. I have asked Enterprise Ireland to review and bring forward a new Female Entrepreneurship Strategy by the end of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of months there has been wide ranging consultation undertaken with key stakeholders. An in-depth review of current research has been carried out through meeting female entrepreneurs at all stages of development via focus groups and one to one interview.<\/p>  <p>  The main challenges identified can be broadly categorised into three areas: <\/p>  <p>  - Pipeline (of future female entrepreneurs) <\/p>  <p>  - Female founded Start Ups (High Potential Start Ups)<\/p>  <p>  - Scaling of female led enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  In developing this new strategy, consideration is also being given to encompassing the broader entrepreneurship agenda, to target ambitious female led companies to scale in international markets as well as continuing to focus on increasing female founded HPSUs.<\/p>  <p>  Across Government, my Department is supporting the newly formed &ldquo;Balance for Better Business&rdquo; initiative, led by my colleague Minister Staunton. This initiative was launched in July this year and will examine the gender mix at the governance and senior management levels in companies, as well as the issues that arise in connection with the appointment of directors and senior management. <\/p>  <p>  Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of my Department, is one of the leaders on this group alongside Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland and Julie Sinnamon, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland.

I understand fully how important an employer this company has been to the area and the role it has played in supporting jobs and enterprise in the Mid-West.  <\/p>  <p>  The IDA first learnt of the decision by the firm to cease operating in Shannon on 21 October. My Department was informed immediately afterwards by the Agency through the Early Warning System. We unfortunately had no other prior notice of the company&rsquo;s intentions. <\/p>  <p>  Our immediate concern was of course for the workers and families who stood to be impacted. We were therefore determined to act as swiftly as possible to address the closure and help mitigate, as much as possible, its consequences for the employees and the Shannon region. I also spoke with the CEO of the company on 22 October, who explained that the company&rsquo;s decision was irreversible. <\/p>  <p>  On 23 October I travelled to Shannon, together with Minister of State Breen, to convene a meeting of key stakeholders. This included representatives from the State&rsquo;s principal enterprise agencies, Government Departments, Clare County Council, Third Level institutions and the local business community. Our collective focus was to determine how best to respond and to assist those employees who would be impacted by the closure.  <\/p>  <p>  Following that meeting, an action plan was agreed with Molex to support the skill development needs of its workers and to help them find alternative employment. Many of those impacted have valuable skills and experience and the IDA, together with other stakeholders, will be drawing the attention of potential employers to their availability. The IDA will also be working separately to market the facility to prospective investors and to find new investment for the area.  <\/p>  <p>  Looking further ahead, we will need &ndash; as was collectively agreed at the stakeholder meeting &ndash; to ensure we create new opportunities across the wider Mid-West region that can help offset many of these job losses. The Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan &ndash; which was launched earlier this year &ndash; will be a critical tool in that respect. <\/p>  <p>  While the Molex closure undeniably represents a significant blow for Shannon and the wider area, it remains the case that the Mid-West is performing well in economic terms. The region has seen significant investment in the last three years and key employers include many large-scale manufacturing employers such as Beckton Dickinson, Edwards Lifesciences, Analog Devices, Johnson and Johnson, Regeneron, Stryker and Zimmer. We are therefore optimistic that further new opportunities can be created for the area in the time ahead.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge, in this context, that the Molex closure is purely the result of a decision by the company to discontinue certain product lines that are manufactured in Ireland. It has nothing to do with the competitiveness of our economy or the skills of our workforce. The company has made that fully clear itself. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Registration","counter":981,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS02700"},{"type":"question","counter":982,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[44399\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the process and details of the requirement for new companies to register with the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies; if companies must register with the latter in addition to the Companies Registration Office.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":983,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[44400\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the administrative burden associated with SMEs having to register twice with two company registers as per correspondence (details supplied); and her further views on the proposals set out with respect to registration and a direct helpline for support on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":984,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.<\/p><p>From November 2016, companies have been obliged to obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information in respect of the natural persons who are their beneficial owners\/controllers.<\/p><p>Under S.I.

The purpose of collecting data on the beneficial owners of companies is to identify the natural persons who are the real owners\/controllers of a company and make this data available to Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), state competent authorities, obliged entities and the general public in order to prevent the use of the European Union&rsquo;s financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing.

This is to ensure that the natural person exists, is still alive and to avoid duplication on the Register. As part of the validation process, the Registrar compares the data filed with the RBO against the data registered with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) for that person, using an electronic interface. <\/p><p>Under Data Protection Regulations, the RBO does not have access to the personal details entered by the presenter and as such is not in a position to share personal information on potential beneficial owners and reasons for rejection of submissions. Nevertheless, common reasons for RBO submission rejection are listed on the RBO FAQ section and a contact point in DEASP is provided where companies can check the data held by DEASP for each beneficial owner so that they can enter matching data in the RBO.<\/p><p>The information that is required to be filed with the RBO in respect of each beneficial owner (who must be a natural person) is as follows: <\/p><p>- Forename and Surname;<\/p><p>- Date of birth;<\/p><p>- Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) except where a beneficial owner does not have a PPSN, in which case a Declaration as to Verification of Identity can be uploaded;<\/p><p>- Nationality; <\/p><p>- Residential address; <\/p><p>- A statement of the nature of the interest held by each beneficial owner (e.g. controlling shareholder);<\/p><p>- A statement of the extent of the interest held by each beneficial owner (e.g. controller of 26% of shares in company); <\/p><p>- The date on which each natural person was entered in the company's own register as a beneficial owner;<\/p><p>- The date of cessation as beneficial owner.<\/p><p>If, having exhausted all possible means, no natural persons are identified as beneficial owners, there shall be entered in the RBO the names and details of the natural person(s) who hold the position(s) of senior managing official(s) of the company\/industrial and provident society.

Our primary concern remains supporting those who will be directly impacted by the job losses. That is why every form of state assistance will be made available to the firm&rsquo;s employees.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst it does not change the fact that valuable jobs will be lost, it&rsquo;s important to note that the redundancies at the Novartis firms will take place over the next three years: 60 in 2020, 80 in 2021 and 180 in 2022. That does at least provide time in which intensive efforts will be made to offset some of these future job losses through the creation of new employment opportunities in the Ringaskiddy and Carrigaline areas. It is also the case that the employees affected have highly sought-after skills and experience in the competitive pharmaceutical industry. Given the industry&rsquo;s significant presence in Ireland, and its particular footprint in the wider Cork area, we can be hopeful that many of those who will be made redundant should be able to quickly find similar high-quality jobs in the same industry.<\/p>  <p>  As regards State engagement with Novartis itself, IDA Ireland has a close working relationship with the firm, as it does with the vast majority of its client companies. I understand that officials from the Agency had several meetings this year, both in Cork and abroad, with Novartis management. The IDA was therefore both aware that the company was examining the efficiency of its global manufacturing network and that its facility in Ringaskiddy was operating below capacity. Accordingly, the Agency engaged with Novartis to support and safeguard its future presence here, in a similar way to how it regularly works with its clients all over Ireland to help grow their business and employment numbers in the country.  <\/p>  <p>  However, whilst there was an awareness of under-capacity at the facility in Ringaskiddy, the first the IDA learnt of the company&rsquo;s intention to make any employees redundant was on 22 October. Once that information was provided by the company to the IDA that evening, the Agency relayed it to myself and my Department through an early warning report. We unfortunately did not have any other prior notice of potential job losses at the company. <\/p>  <p>  I subsequently spoke directly with the company&rsquo;s management. I made it clear that the Irish Government very much regretted its decision. IDA officials also held separate meetings with Novartis since the announcement, with both its management in Ringaskiddy and in Basel, Switzerland. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said, our focus now is supporting the impacted employees and their families. Key State supports include the Intreo service, operated by the Department of Employment Affairs Social Protection. That will help advise employees on entitlements and protections, as well as on re-training and education options. The IDA will be working hard, with both its existing clients in the area but also with prospective investors, to create new jobs in the area.<\/p>  <p>  While it is difficult to be positive so soon after an announcement of redundancies, the reality is that Cork &ndash; including the strong biopharmaceutical industry there &ndash; has performed strongly in foreign direct investment terms in recent years. Nearly 15,000 net new jobs have been created by IDA clients there over the last nine years. That trend looks set to continue and therefore provides grounds for optimism that new jobs can soon be created to replace those that will be unfortunately lost at Novartis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":992,"content":"<p>Question No. 382 answered with Question No. 375.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":993,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS04300"},{"type":"question","counter":994,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[44587\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the actions that she and the IDA are taking to safeguard FDI jobs here and to combat the decline of Ireland in global competitiveness following recent multinational jobs losses in counties Clare and Cork.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":995,"content":"<p>The recent job losses announced in Counties and Cork are very disappointing.  However, these announcements are not a reflection of the strength or competitiveness of our economy. It is important to recognise that the overall trend of employment and investment continues to be very positive &ndash; in Clare, in Cork, in Munster and in Ireland as a whole &ndash; and there have been a number of significant investments in 2019 across all regions. In fact, there are now over 230,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies &ndash; the highest-ever figure &ndash; and last year alone IDA Ireland won 265 projects, compared with 237 in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Retaining and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) remains fundamentally important to our economic model. That is why IDA Ireland continues to work closely with international clients, from a range of sectors, to attract job-rich investment from overseas firms, often in the face of increasing international competition for high-value investment projects.<\/p>  <p>  In doing so, the IDA has targeted both new-name investors and increased investment from companies already located here. The Agency has also restructured its global footprint in response to Brexit and other global challenges. This expansion of the IDA&rsquo;s presence overseas has allowed IDA&rsquo;s staff to secure new investment opportunities from non-traditional target markets and to further diversify our sources of investment. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is as competitive as possible. We are conscious of the areas in which we need to improve, including increasing the availability of certain labour market skills and investing further in infrastructure through Project Ireland 2040. We have also introduced Future Jobs Ireland, a cross-government initiative with a strong focus on improving productivity. One of the key features of Future Jobs is developing an awareness of the importance of lifelong learning and continuous training and upskilling. That means when economic patterns shift, businesses and workers alike are better able to adapt and evolve.  <\/p>  <p>  Our efforts to win more FDI will be helped by our continued status as an attractive destination with a proven track record as a successful home for overseas firms. Of course, Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union ensures that companies considering investment here will gain barrier-free access to the EU market. When taken together with other strengths, such as our pro-enterprise environment and our highly skilled dynamic workforce, I am confident that Ireland will continue to be an attractive destination for FDI in the years ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":996,"content":"<p>Question No. 384 answered with Question No. 378.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector","counter":997,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS04700"},{"type":"question","counter":998,"qnumday":385,"qnumall":"[44669\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500076#WRS04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if in her capacity as chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, she consulted with the membership of the forum in relation to the impact the &euro;175 retail export scheme threshold will have on the Irish retail sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":999,"content":"<p>As the largest private sector employer in the country that supports jobs in every city, town and village in the country I understand the importance of the retail sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum (RCF), which I chair, was established in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum enables key issues affecting the retail sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support sustainable jobs growth in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit has been a standing item on the agenda for the Retail Consultation Forum (RCF) since 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports include preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTrade Ireland.

This is addressed under Pillar 4 of the Government's Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. <\/p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which can offer benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key deliverables under Pillar 4 with the objective of fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. These include deliverables such as holding a national consultation on flexible working options, the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options, and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave. <\/p>  <p>  A further deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider related policies abroad, such as the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo; in France, in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working.<\/p>  <p>  This research will include desk research, a national employee survey, and key stakeholder engagement. In order to aid this engagement, I held a Remote Working Stakeholder Forum in Cavan Digital Hub on July 18th. The results arising from this event will be included in the final research.<\/p>  <p>  The research will be completed in Q4 of this year and will be published shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500077#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":1016,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500077#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1017,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[44926\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500077#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the support avenues available to a start-up business that will be located in rural County Westmeath and will immediately create five to ten permanent positions.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1018,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector.

EU rules and regulations, which are encapsulated in the National Public Procurement Policy Framework.

Each business unit is responsible for its own procurement of goods and services. A significant proportion of the Department&rsquo;s procurement is undertaken via centralised framework arrangements put in place by the OGP.  <\/p>  <p>  Procurement also features prominently as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s (C&amp;AG) annual audit of my Department&rsquo;s Vote. In addition, the Department&rsquo;s own Internal Audit Unit, also periodically conduct procurement audits, the most recent one being completed this summer.   <\/p>  <p>  In any given year there will always be certain circumstances where a full procurement process cannot be conducted. Typically, such instances are where:   <\/p>  <p>  - The provision of the required service can only be sourced from a sole supplier e.g. ICT software licenses and\/or support;<\/p>  <p>  - Specialist expertise is needed e.g. certain legal or translation services;<\/p>  <p>  - A timing issue arises as the Department or its Offices await new OGP framework agreement(s) to be finalised for certain goods or services. In such cases, the Department or its Offices, typically have no option but to undertake a short-term extension to an existing contract until the OGP framework is in place.   <\/p>  <p>  All such instances are brought to the attention of the C&amp;AG in line with Department of Finance Circular 40\/2002 and as part of the Department&rsquo;s annual Appropriation Account. This process involves signoff by the Principal Officer responsible for the Procurement Co-Ordination Unit and also the Secretary General in her role as Accounting Officer. The 2017 and 2018 Appropriation Accounts have been certified by the C&amp;AG. Preparations for the 2019 Appropriation Account have recently commenced. <\/p>  <p>   The C&amp;AG noted that in 2017 there were 8 instances of short-term contract extensions where it was not possible to undertake a full procurement process.  The related in-year expenditure totalled &euro;365,000. The services contracted for included cleaning, offsite file storage, office stationery, translation costs, specialist consultancy and legal expertise. In addition, services were provided by six sole suppliers covering ICT licenses and support, telephony services and specialist publications. The related in-year expenditure to sole suppliers totalled &euro;661,000. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018 there were four instances of short-term contract extensions where it was not possible to conduct a full procurement process and these involved in-year expenditure of &euro;310,00.

Cervical screening aims to prevent cervical cancer through the early detection and treatment of pre-cancerous changes on the cervix. Earlier detection can often increase treatment options, as well as reduce the invasiveness of that treatment. It is estimated that regular cervical screening can prevent 75% (or 3 out of 4) of cervical cancer cases. Since 2008, 1,200 invasive cancers have been detected by CervicalCheck. More than 50,000 women with high grade abnormalities (CIN 2 &amp;amp; 3) have been diagnosed and treated, considerably reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer. CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland - these dropped from around 14 per 100,000 in the period 2009-2011 to 10 per 100,000 in the period 2013-2015.  Cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer, and some women will still develop cervical cancer despite regular screening.<\/p><p>Also, to clarify the Deputy's reference to failings in the cervical cancer screening programme, it should be noted that the Report of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, conducted by Dr Gabriel Scally, is unequivocal in stating that the widespread non-disclosure of the results of historical screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families concerned. It caused significant distress and additional suffering to those affected.  However, Dr Scally was clear in his Final Report, published September 2018, that the Inquiry was satisfied with the quality management processes in the labs contracted by CervicalCheck. <\/p><p>His report presented no evidence that either the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected in a cervical screening programme.  He confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.<\/p><p>The SCA has provided me with the information set out below in relation to the Deputy's question. This information is correct as at 30 October 2019.<\/p><p><b>Response from State Claims Agency:<\/b><\/p><p>The information contained within this report has been extracted from the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and is as at 30th October 2019.<\/p><p><b>1.

The implementation of genomic medicine in routine clinical care &ndash; often referred to as &lsquo;personalised&rsquo;, &lsquo;precision&rsquo; or &lsquo;stratified&rsquo; medicine &ndash; requires careful and comprehensive planning due to a range of scientific and social challenges. These include issues such as test reliability and validity, cost-effectiveness, health system and workforce readiness, and regulatory and ethical concerns. The application of genomic medicine is a relatively new and cutting-edge field; there are already some therapies in place, and considerable research being undertaken globally, to fully explore its potential applications. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is well placed for use of genomic medicine; with a relatively homogenous population, this provides opportunities to combine genetic information and health data. Ireland has a strong tradition of investing in genetic and genomic research through the Health Research Board, the Higher Education Authority and Science Foundation Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Donnai and Newman Report commissioned by the HSE, recommended improvements in the governance, management and future development of genetic services. The 2016 Smith Report (Report of the National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network Strategy Group) reviewed the Donnai and Newman Report and made recommendations for the next steps. On foot of these, in 2018 Acute Operations received new service development funding to begin the process of establishing a National Genetics and Genomics Medicine Network (NGGMN); to bring together all parties within the field of genomic medicine for multi-disciplinary working in a national clinical and research centre. The NGGMN will build the effective governance arrangements that recognises the interdependence between corporate, financial and clinical governance across the service and integrate them to deliver high quality, safe and reliable healthcare.  Development of this NGGMN will be a joint initiative between Acute Operations and the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer and the recruitment process for a clinical lead is at an advanced stage. <\/p>  <p>  As genomics is a new area of medicine, it is not possible to calculate how many patients might benefit, however it is likely that the specialisms of cancer, and rare diseases will be the among the first fields to benefit from advancements in genomics medicine. However, the demand for genetic assessment and testing is growing rapidly, due primarily to an increased awareness among the public and among health care professionals.  <\/p>  <p>  Many rare diseases are genetic in origin and, as such, effective genetic services can have an important role to play in relation to diagnosis and possible treatment. The medical genetics service in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin provides services for patients and families affected by, or at risk of, a genetic disorder.  It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, provided additional resources last year to support the hospital&rsquo;s Department of Clinical Genetics.  Investments in staff and equipment to further develop the service is continuing.<\/p>  <p>  The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 highlighted the growing role of cancer genetics in cancer prevention and cancer care. The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme is working closely with clinical genetics and cancer genetics services in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and St James&rsquo;s Hospital to develop the services to meet the growing need.  Under the strategy, investments have been made in genetic counsellor, consultant and support positions, as well as cancer genetic testing.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the significant opportunities and benefits afforded by genetic and genomic research, and in this regard, there are currently discussions underway with my officials. A key objective is to ensure that Ireland develops a comprehensive national policy\/strategy, in consultation with stakeholders, which ensures that we both respond to these opportunities and overcome the not insignificant challenges of implementing a genomic medicine programme in a health service delivery context.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the provision of training for genetic services, as this is a service matter and I have asked the HSE to consider and respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500078#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1086,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500078#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1087,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[44187\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500078#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for a heart bypass operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1088,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced.

In return for cooperation with a range of service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) over the next four years.  This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme.<\/p>  <p>  There will be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>   In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>   During the 2019\/20 school year, girls attending secondary school can still join the HPV girls only programme with appointments offered in HSE mop up clinics.  It must be noted that vaccinated women and girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>  <p>   As you are aware, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:  <\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection; <\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPVvaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500082#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":1299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500082#WRY00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1300,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[44465\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500082#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will direct the HSE to carry out the tests and investigations necessary before the end of January 2020 in the case of a person (details supplied) in view of the fact that this will be necessary if a school is to make an application for a special needs assistant in February 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1301,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Meetings took place in February, May and September of this year. Quarterly meetings with this important stakeholder will continue, to take place to ensure that their input and the voice of the patient is represented. The Department of Health also meets regularly with the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the National Rare Disease Office to monitor progress.<\/p>  <p>  Many rare diseases are genetic in origin and, as such, effective genetic services can have an important role to play in relation to diagnosis and possible treatment. The medical genetics service in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin provides services for patients and families affected by, or at risk of, a genetic disorder.  It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, provided additional resources last year to support the hospital&rsquo;s Department of Clinical Genetics.  An external multi professional team, led by an experienced NHS UK Health Manager, has been assisting in the improvement of the service.  Investments in staff and equipment to further develop the service is continuing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, and the 10-year strategy for transforming healthcare in Ireland, Sl&aacute;intecare, acknowledges the fundamental importance of research in delivering high quality and informed services based on robust data and rigorous research. Clinical trials, in particular, are at the heart of improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. International evidence clearly shows that standards of care are higher in research-active healthcare organisations, and this results in greater access to innovative treatments and improved outcomes for patients. In addition, this improves the recruitment and retention of high calibre staff into the health service and attracts industrial collaboration and jobs. For this reason, the Department of Health, via the Health Research Board, has invested over &euro;150m in clinical research infrastructure and supports over the last decade. This has resulted in the establishment of state-of-the-art clinical research facilities on the campuses of hospitals, clinical trials networks to support the conduct of multi-centre trials, a Trials Methodology Research Network (HRB-TMRN) to support the development of methodological skills in trials and intervention research and Clinical Research Coordination Ireland (HRB-CRCI) to act as a one-stop-shop for all those interested in the conduct of multi-site clinical trials in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  As a further sign of his commitment to clinical research and his ambition to increase the trial footprint in Ireland, the Minister recently secured government approval to become a member of the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN). By managing and supporting trials across borders, connecting networks, and advising and implementing policy, it advances knowledge flow, competitiveness and integration in European clinical research. As a member, Ireland&rsquo;s clinical trial researchers will now have access to a wider patient base and diversity, expertise from across Europe and potential cost savings through resource sharing with other member states. Membership of ECRIN will also increase the ability of people in Ireland to be part of research on rare conditions and to benefit from breakthroughs as ECRIN represents a population of 300 million, giving access to much larger trials than could be delivered in Ireland alone. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently over 330 clinical investigators in Ireland leading and undertaking trials across the clinical trials infrastructure mentioned above. To ensure that we are pro-actively and constantly developing the future cadre of clinician and non-clinician clinical research investigators, the HRB has an expansive portfolio of early-, mid- and senior career investigator awards and fellowships. The HRB has also introduced a dedicated funding stream in recent years to fund clinical trials and intervention studies.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, one of the most long-standing barriers to the conduct of seamless and efficient clinical trials in Ireland is our current system of Research Ethics approval. In July this year, the Minister secured approval for a National Research Ethics Committee Bill. The establishment of a National Office for Research Ethics Committees, and the urgent establishment of a National Research Ethics Committee in the area of Clinical Trials (of Medicinal Products), will deliver an effective and coherent national model which will benefit those conducting and participating in trials.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is aware of the significant opportunities and benefits afforded by genetic and genomic research. The key objective for the Department, and the Minister, is to ensure that Ireland develops a comprehensive national policy\/strategy which ensures that we both respond to these opportunities and overcome the not insignificant challenges of implementing a genomic medicine programme in a health service delivery context. <\/p>  <p>  The ultimate goal is for genomic medicine to benefit individuals, the healthcare system and society. In 2016 Professor Owen Smith authored the &lsquo;Report of the National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network Strategy Group&rsquo;. On foot of the recommendations outlined in this report, in 2018 the HSE received new service development funding to begin the process of establishing a National Genetics and Genomics Medicine Network. The aim of this Network, once established, is that it would build the effective governance arrangements that recognises the interdependence between corporate, financial and clinical governance across the service and integrate them to deliver high quality, safe and reliable healthcare. Discussions are at an advanced stage to initiate the recruitment of a National Director of this Network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500083#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Quality","counter":1369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500083#WRZ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1370,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[44546\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500083#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the health consequences arising from the delay in implementing a nationwide smoky coal ban; when he last raised the issue directly with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment; when he is scheduled to meet the Minister or his officials to discuss the issue; if his attention has been drawn to the recent report by the EPA on air quality here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1371,"content":"<p>Air Quality is an important environmental determinant of health.

The Air Quality Index for Health (AQIH) was the measure used for ambient air quality (Available URL:<i>)<\/i>.  The preliminary findings from this work have highlighted that the ambient air quality in Dublin is predominantly good (i.e. Good: 96%; Fair: 3%; Poor: 1%; and Very poor: &amp;lt; 1%).

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the primary childhood immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against disease.  Measles is an acute and serious infection caused by the measles virus and is highly infectious.  It is a notifiable disease (under Infectious Disease legislation) and all cases are reported to Departments of Public Health within the HSE.  Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended by NIAC &ndash; one dose at 12 months of age and a second booster dose when your child is 4\/5 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that vaccine hesitancy is not unique to Ireland.

In this regard, I launched the Vaccine Alliance in September.  Its aim is to increase the uptake of childhood vaccines and reduce vaccine hesitancy.

In 2019 almost &euro;30 million extra was added to the budget, with a target of delivering 18.26 million hours to over 53,000 people. This represented about 800,000 more hours of support than the 2018 target.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.<\/p>  <p>  To achieve a balanced budget in 2019 the HSE must ensure that the cost of the home support hours being provided does not exceed the available budget. This is in line with normal prudent management of the budget.  It is not correct to say that there is an embargo on home support hours.  The allocation of new hours continues to be based on clients&rsquo; needs and the resources available. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, an additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens. <\/p>  <p>  We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million in 2020. In 2020 the HSE will deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.  <\/p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens. <\/p>  <p>  The core principles of Healthy Ireland, Positive Ageing, prevention and early intervention will underpin this approach.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to recruitment, I am advised by the HSE that while there is no national recruitment embargo or moratorium, there is a priority requirement for all HSE services to maintain, or get to, an affordable staffing level that is sustainable in 2019 and 2020, while also prioritising the delivery of safe services.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this, the HSE have introduced control measures relating to staffing and recruitment to ensure that they live within the available resources provided to them.  This does mean that in some Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations non-critical replacement posts will be paused, however, the HSE report that there is on-going capacity for replacement of critical clinical posts within frontline services throughout this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500088#WREE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Provision","counter":1701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500088#WREE05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1702,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[44993\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500088#WREE06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a student (details supplied) in County Clare will receive an appointment for orthodontic treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1703,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500088#WREE06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":1705,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500089#WRFF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1706,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[44994\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500089#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when general practitioner services will be reinstated to full service at a centre (details supplied).","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1707,"content":"<p>As this question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for it to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500089#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":1708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500089#WRFF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1709,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[45002\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500089#WRFF00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has sought an allocation within budget 2020 in order to address the crisis in Traveller mental health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1710,"content":"<p>Budget 2020 announced &euro;39 million additional funding for mental health services bringing its budget to &euro;1.026 billion in 2020.

The couple involved have requested a review of their case.  <\/p>  <p>  My overriding concern as Minister for Health is for the couple involved and ensuring that questions regarding this incident are appropriately answered. As such, I support an independent and external review into this case. I have been advised that the National Maternity Hospital has commissioned such a review.

It will also allow for any learning that may emerge to be disseminated throughout the health system. I can assure the Deputy and the House that any recommendations made by the review panel will be actioned by my Department, as well as the HSE in order to ensure that a similar incident does not occur again. My Department has also sought assurances from the National Maternity Hospital with regard to the safety and operation of the termination service, and it in turn has confirmed its compliance with the relevant legislation. <\/p>  <p>  I have also met with the family to hear directly of their experiences.

In 2019 almost &euro;30 million extra was added to the budget, with a target of delivering 18.26 million hours to over 53,000 people. This represented about 800,000 more hours of support than the 2018 target.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.<\/p>  <p>  To achieve a balanced budget in 2019 the HSE must ensure that the cost of the home support hours being provided does not exceed the available budget. This is in line with normal prudent management of the budget.  It is not correct to say that there is an embargo on home support hours.  The allocation of new hours continues to be based on clients&rsquo; needs and the resources available.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, an additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million in 2020. In 2020 the HSE will deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.  <\/p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The core principles of Healthy Ireland, Positive Ageing, prevention and early intervention will underpin this approach.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to recruitment, I am advised by the HSE that while there is no national recruitment embargo or moratorium, there is a priority requirement for all HSE services to maintain, or get to, an affordable staffing level that is sustainable in 2019 and 2020, while also prioritising the delivery of safe services.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this, the HSE have introduced control measures relating to staffing and recruitment to ensure that they live within the available resources provided to them.  This does mean that in some Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations non-critical replacement posts will be paused, however, the HSE report that there is on-going capacity for replacement of critical clinical posts within frontline services throughout this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":1831,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1832,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[45287\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons with type 1 diabetes that had their diabetes care at University Hospital Waterford sourced to other hospitals in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1833,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1834,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1835,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[45288\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the protocols in place when moving paediatric diabetes patients to adult diabetes services at University Hospital Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1836,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1837,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1838,"qnumday":677,"qnumall":"[45296\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500091#WRHH03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an appointment for scans at Beaumont Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1839,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Quality service provision is expensive and it is fair and equitable that all those in receipt of publicly funded residential care make appropriate payment toward the maintenance and accommodation costs associated with providing such services, if they can afford to do so.  Funding derived from maintenance and accommodation contributions will continue to be directly applied by the HSE towards the provision of health services.&rdquo;<\/i> <\/blockquote>  <p>Residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions apply to all forms of residential support services, other than acute in-patient services and nursing home services provided to those supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal).  In line with the system of charges it replaced, residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions: <\/p><p>- apply to the maintenance and accommodation elements only of services which are provided by the HSE or by agencies funded to provide services on behalf of the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.<\/p><p>- become payable when a person has already received at least 30 days of residential support services during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Accordingly, each episode of rehabilitative care might not necessarily result in a contribution requirement. <\/p><p>The Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016 (as amended) provide for the rates of income-based contributions which are payable towards accommodation and maintenance costs.In accommodation such as a community hospital where full-time nursing and\/or medical care is provided, the current contribution rates payable are subject to a maximum of &euro;25.57 daily (&euro;179 per week) for a person whose income is &euro;223 per week or more.<\/p><p>Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions provisions.  In all cases, the contribution rates are based on sliding scales, with proportionally lower contribution rates applying to those on lower incomes. Additionally, section 67D of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a contribution where appropriate, in order to: <\/p><p>- avoid undue financial hardship on the part of the service user and\/or on the part of the service user&rsquo;s dependants  <i>,<\/i><\/p><p>- advance a service user&rsquo;s identified needs (e.g. care plan objectives), or<\/p><p>- take account of separate contributions (if any) made by a service user towards his or her maintenance or accommodation costs.<\/p><p>To assist in the fair application of the framework, the HSE has published, and periodically updated, national guidelines for the correct determination of the contributions and comprehensive waiver guidelines (approved by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform) on the individual circumstances where such contributions may need to be reduced or waived.  The guidelines specify that service providers must have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable contribution may be reduced or waived where appropriate, taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings, including reasonable regular financial commitments, with a view to ensuring there is no unfair burden on the service user or on his or her dependants.  <\/p><p>The features of the residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions framework ensure that it is reasonable and fair and that each service user's contributions are based on what he or she can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances.  <\/p><p>The HSE publishes detailed supporting documentation in relation to residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions on its website at  www.hse.ie\/longstaycontributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500092#WRJJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Policy","counter":1880,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500092#WRJJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1881,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[45350\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500092#WRJJ01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his position regarding the widespread failure to implement full travel time for healthcare support assistants further to the confirmation of this legal entitlement by the HSE in August 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1882,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500092#WRJJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1883,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500092#WRJJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1884,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[45354\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500092#WRJJ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical procedure will take place for a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1885,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of the market volatility and uncertainty.  Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of almost &euro;78 million.     <\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. <\/p>  <p>  This year, I introduced the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million scheme which will provide suckler farmers with valuable data on the weaning efficiency of their animals. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for beef farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, Knowledge Transfer Groups and the ANC scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The total budget for the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme was increased again this year to &euro;250 million. Further to changes in EU Regulations, payments under the ANC scheme will now be delivered in two instalments, with 85% advance payments issuing from mid-September and a 15% balancing payment issuing from early December.    <\/p>  <p>  Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>  <p>  In recognising the major challenges faced by the farming sector and the important role that various schemes operated by my Department play in underpinning the viability of many farms, I secured agreement from the European Commission that will allow for a higher rate of advance payments under the 2019 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and a number of Rural Development Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is a constant and central component of the strategic development of the industry, as evidenced by its placement at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development.

This site is adjacent to a SAC and the choice of species was of the utmost importance, as it would feed into the Appropriate Assessment Screening.  The applicant was contacted in November 2018, requesting a decision on the species.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2019, correspondence from the Registered Forester noted that the applicant wished to continue with the species chosen.  In March 2019, the applicant and Registered Forester were asked to resubmit information in view of the surrounding SAC.

This is as a result of significant State investment. We now have a new challenge, to meet 8,000 hectares of new planting each year as set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am very aware that this is in the face of declining planting rates and that this year has been disappointing in terms of hectares planted.<\/p>  <p>  However, I believe that we can, through a concerted and collaborative effort from government, the private sector, public bodies and local communities, reverse this trend and meet the Climate Action targets so essential to delivering on our national climate change objectives. <\/p>  <p>  Support for afforestation from Government is delivered through the generous grants and premiums available, across 12 different planting categories which offer real options to suit every landowner.  Farmers can continue with livestock farming, while supplementing their income by planting trees, and we intend communicating this message widely. To this end, we are funding 15 promotion projects countrywide this year and next in the amount of &euro;830,000 and Teagasc is actively promoting forestry through a substantial programme of educational and forestry events.<\/p>  <p>  Communities can and have become involved through the NeighbourWood Scheme, funded by my Department, which supports the development of accessible woodlands for public use and enjoyment.<\/p>  <p>  The Woodland Environmental Fund allows business to discharge their corporate responsibility and to support the national effort by paying a supplementary &euro;1,000 a hectare to landowners for the planting of native woodlands.  I am delighted that An Post  is supporting this initiative through the  establishment of a new native woodland in County Galway, and  I know that other organisations have expressed interest in encouraging native woodland planting by means of the Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Public bodies have a role to play too.  In this regard, I very much welcome the recent announcement by Coillte and Bord na Mona of their plans to plant 4 million native trees on 1,500 hectares over the next three years.  I will be encouraging others to follow suit.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the afforestation scheme, I acknowledge that changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP) has resulted in delays to many files.  These  are beyond my Department&rsquo;s control as we are obliged to implement changes to AAP that were required following important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee and others.  All forestry licences issued by the Department undergo a legal consent process. Since 2017, all licence afforestation and forest road applications received have been subject to a statutory public notification system and all afforestation, forest roads and felling decisions  issued are subject to a statutory appeal system operated by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC). <\/p>  <p>  Most appeals have been in connection with our Appropriate Assessment (AA) procedure. The Habitat Directive (Article 6.3) requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, either individually or in-combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment of its implications for that Natura site. In this regard, the introduction of the 15 km assessment buffer around potential forestry sites is necessary and is an industry norm.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, we are amending the AA procedure in order to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involves the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  Last week, the Department advertised for additional ecologists and we also have access to external ecological support, which will be supplemented in due course.  Inspectors have already undergone training and will receive appropriate support in delivering these new procedures; they are not on a work to rule. A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that this has led to a temporary disruption in issuing afforestation licences, we know that the sector has approximately 3,200 hectares of approvals issued this year which are shovel-ready and yet to be planted.  <\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the concerns of the sector in relation to the AA process. My officials are in regular communication with stakeholders and they have been fully apprised of the issues involved and of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to address them.  They have also been advised of steps they can take to ensure that applications received are completed to an acceptable standard and to take account of any issues relating to sensitive habitats.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, for my part, I have commissioned a consultant to review my Department's processes and procedures on forestry applications and approvals similar to an exercise undertaken in Scotland.  I expect to receive this report by the end of November and that it will provide an opportunity to make our processes more effective and efficient going forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500098#WRPP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts Data","counter":2153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500098#WRPP01600"},{"type":"question","counter":2154,"qnumday":813,"qnumall":"[45056\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500098#WRPP01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the details of contracts of &euro;25,000 or more that have been awarded by his Department or bodies under his aegis that were found to be non-compliant with procurement guidelines in 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2155,"content":"<p>In line with the requirements of Department of Finance Circular 40\/2002, each year my Department carries out an assessment of contracts with a value above &euro;25,000 that were awarded in the preceding year without a competitive process, and submits a report to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) by 31 March.

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The method of selecting cases for inspection is set down in EU regulations and is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process with cases being selected on a risk and random basis.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be in respect of eligible beneficiaries under the various schemes. Therefore, the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, i.e. 15th May, is an on-going process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is fulfilled.. <\/p>  <p>  This year, late applications were accepted up to 9th June, with a deduction. Furthermore, amendments to applications were accepted up to 9th June, and, allowing for the Preliminary Checks process whereby applicants could amend their application further up to 19th June as a result of issues notified to them by my Department, the final details of the land to be subject to the inspection process cannot be fully established until these periods have elapsed.    <\/p>  <p>  The process of a Remote Sensing inspection involves a comprehensive review of the satellite imagery received at two stages during the year, and also the assessment of additional imagery, where required, to ensure that the actual claimed area in the application corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that the crop types are as claimed and that ineligible land or features are not included for payment purposes. The governing regulations further prescribe that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground. <\/p>  <p>  Some 6,840 applicants have been selected for a Remote Sensing inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. As of 4th November, my Department had received inspection results in respect of 83% of these cases for final processing. Of these cases, over 95% have been finalised and advanced to payment stage processing, which ensures that any non-inspection related scheme criteria have been met. For example, an applicant under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme must meet scheme specific criteria relating to stocking density and stock retention periods before payment can issue.<\/p>  <p>  Where an over-declaration in area, at scheme level, is identified as part of the inspection process, officials in my Department contact the applicant concerned giving them the opportunity to accept the inspection findings or to submit comments for examination. Currently, 2% of cases for which inspection results have been received are at this stage of the process and will be finalised when the applicant contacts my Department. The remaining cases are subject to final processing. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to finalise the outcome of Remote Sensing inspections on a daily basis to ensure that ANC and BPS payments due are issued as quickly as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500098#WRPP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Costs","counter":2168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500098#WRPP03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2169,"qnumday":818,"qnumall":"[45349\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500098#WRPP03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department has studied the average price of rent paid per hectare in County Galway; if so, the average price; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2170,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Annual Review and Outlook for Agriculture, Food and the Marine 2019&rdquo; provides up to date information and statistical analysis on a wide variety of topics impacting the agri-food sector.

It was designated as a project of common interest in 2013 and again in 2015, and 2017. It has been supported by Ireland since 2013 as it would enhance Ireland&rsquo;s energy security by increasing import route diversity. This project is one of a number of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects included in the 4th EU PCI list. <\/p>  <p>  However, while Ireland continued to support the inclusion of Shannon LNG on the 4th EU PCI list, I have made it clear that the Government will not consider any application for EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding for any LNG project until an energy and sustainability security of supply review has been completed and considered by the Government and the D&aacute;il, and only if the projects in question are consistent with national and EU climate policy objectives. <\/p>  <p>  The energy sustainability and security review will consider how and from where fossil fuels are sourced during a transition to a carbon neutral economy. It will also consider the role that battery storage, pumped storage, hydrogen and CCS can play. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, at the meeting of 4 October 2019 which considered the 4th PCI list, Ireland enquired from the EU Commission whether the implications of importing LNG to the European Union, from conventional and unconventional fracked sources, have been examined in terms of a sustainable, secure and competitive European energy policy. The Commission advised that it had launched a study on methane emissions and agreed with the need to link gas imports to the objective of a climate neutral economy. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the process of PCI selection, it is organised by the European Commission in accordance with the requirements of EU Regulation 347\/2013 which covers PCIs. This involves an evaluation process of projects put forward by project promoters. The process also involves the project promoters, regulators, Member States and other stakeholders participating in regional groups to discuss the projects. <\/p>  <p>  The draft PCI list, which was agreed by Member States and the Commission at a meeting of 4 October 2019, has now been adopted by delegated act by the European Commission, and forwarded by the Commission to the European Council and Parliament for their consideration.<\/p>  <p>  My Department did not seek external advice on the inclusion of the Shannon LNG project on the 4th   list of Projects of Common Interest; the project has been included on each of the previous PCI lists from 2013 to date.

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The initial Warmer Homes Scheme budget allocation for 2019 was &euro;24 million. However, following a mid-year capital review conducted by my Department and SEAI, the budget has been increased to &euro;39.8 million for 2019. The budget for 2020 will be &euro;52.8 million - a record level of funding for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding. The rules of the Scheme stipulate that repeat upgrade visits are not provided. This rule is in place to ensure that the available Exchequer funding provides upgrades to as many eligible homes as possible and to prioritise eligible homes that have never had any work completed under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the measures available under the scheme were expanded. Previously, those homes which were not suitable for cavity wall insulation could not get their walls insulated under the scheme. Since the expansion of measures, the scheme can now, in certain circumstances, provide internal or external wall insulation. This is permitting the upgrade of a wider range of property types (such as homes with solid walls) and also increases the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve.

In light of this consultation there are currently no plans to change the criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would in fact put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500102#WRTT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","counter":2357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500102#WRTT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2358,"qnumday":895,"qnumall":"[44544\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500102#WRTT01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the budgetary steps that have been taken to support the tourism sector specifically in the midlands and western region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2359,"content":"<p>Tourism has received an allocation of &euro;186 million in Budget 2020, up 10% on the 2019 allocation.

The IMMAC is the funding programme under which an extensive range of infrastructure improvements are carried out which will deliver improved journey speeds and increased reliability for passengers across the country. I have no doubt the Deputy welcomes the fact that I will shortly be seeking Government&rsquo;s approval to enter into a new 5 year IMMAC which will provide over &euro;1billion to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and allow it maintain, renew and improve rail infrastructure. This level of funding represents an approximate 40% increase in the amount of taxpayer funding as compared to the five years between 2014 and 2018 and the fact the network is now funded at a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; level is hugely significant.<\/p><p>However, <i>Project Ireland 2040 <\/i>provides additional funding for the rail network above and beyond this significant contribution under the IMMAC. <\/p><p>In the summer Government approved a new National Train Control Centre which will completely modernise and improve the management of the network and services across the country. Construction will start next year and its completion will support the expanded services planned under the DART Expansion Programme which will roughly double the capacity of the network in the Greater Dublin Area, an area which handles approximately 70% of passenger journeys in any given year. Other projects underway include the City-Centre Re-signalling project, while construction will start next year on a new station in Pelletstown. <\/p><p>The Deputy will also acknowledge that funding under the PSO programme increased by approximately 6% between 2016 and 2018 which has supported increased services such as the 10-minute DART or greater utilisation of the Phoenix Park tunnel on the Kildare Line in recent years. In order to support further passenger growth Government has very recently approved the purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars and I expect those to start entering service in late 2021.<\/p><p>Separately to the above, the future potential for rail is also being examined at a metropolitan level through the development by the National Transport Authority of metropolitan area transport strategies for all cities, which will assist with the Department&rsquo;s approach toward the mid-term review of the current Project Ireland 2040 funding profiles envisaged in 2022, while an independent review of a potential extension of the Western Rail Corridor is expected to be submitted to the Department shortly. My Department also plans to conduct an evaluation in 2020 of higher speeds on the network in line with the commitment given in <i>Project Ireland 2040<\/i>.<\/p><p>As the Deputy can see, there is a significant investment programme underway in relation to rail and I expect this to continue in the years ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500102#WRTT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems","counter":2384,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500102#WRTT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2385,"qnumday":904,"qnumall":"[44416\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500102#WRTT04200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the camera infrastructure in place and operational at a location (details supplied) in Cork city; if there is a live feed from the cameras available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist it in its work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2386,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

I have no function in setting the level of airport charge.<\/p>  <p>  This independent regulation is intended to serve as a proxy for competition and to require the regulated entity (daa) to do things both in terms of pricing and quality of service provision at Dublin Airport that it would almost certainly not choose to do given a free hand. The overriding strategic objective is to ensure that current and future airport customers are presented with choice, value and quality services which also meet the highest international safety and security standards.<\/p>  <p>  In the Final Determination on the maximum level of airport charges at Dublin Airport,for the period 2020 to 2024 recently announced by CAR, the average price for the period 2020 &ndash; 2024 will be &euro;7.87.  This represents an 11% reduction in the base-level 2019 price cap of &euro;8.81 and was made following an extended period of stakeholder consultation.  The reasons underpinning this Final Determination have been set out in some detail by CAR in the published document. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that CAR has acknowledged the need for Dublin Airport to grow and that capital investment is required in both existing and new capacity generating infrastructure which are key pieces of national infrastructure. The price set by CAR makes provision for all capital projects proposed by the daa &ndash; up to &euro;2.3bn of capital investment in the period. The implementation of this investment programme will result in an airport capable of serving 40m passengers per year. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the airports outside Dublin there are always competitive challenges to be faced not least because of the overlap in catchment areas with Dublin Airport and\/or each other.  Indeed it is for this reason that only Dublin Airport is considered to have market power that necessitates regulatory intervention to protect the interests of consumers. There is clearly a market to be served by the regional airports generally and I am confident that they will continue to successfully exploit the opportunities and grow services.  With the exception of Waterford Airport which has not had scheduled services for some years, both the State-owned and other regional airports have all increased passenger traffic over recent years.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500103#WRUU06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","counter":2463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500104#WRVV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2464,"qnumday":931,"qnumall":"[44892\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500104#WRVV00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is considering proposals to allow limousines used by private hire companies to use bus lanes in the same manner as regular taxis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2465,"content":"<p>I am not currently considering proposals to allow limousines used by private hire companies to use bus lanes.  Bus lanes were created - at some expense to the public - to provide on-street priority for bus-based public transport.

This will achieve the twin goals of reducing congestion and reducing pollution.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to buses, bus lanes may also be used by cyclists who, as vulnerable road users, are safer in bus lanes than in general traffic.  The lanes may also, of course, be used by the emergency services. <\/p>  <p>  After the lanes were originally introduced it was decided to allow taxis to use them.  This was a concession based on the fact that taxis are a form of public transport available for on-street hire, like buses, unlike private hire limousines. <\/p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes.

My predecessors and I have always rejected these requests. Any addition to the categories of vehicle permitted to use the lanes would inevitably reduce their efficiency in performing the original purpose of prioritising bus-based public transport.

In Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report (2017\/2018), the staff turnover rate stood at 24.7% which, despite a 3% improvement on the previous year, was unsustainably high. However, data from previous years suggests that only half of those contained in the 24.7% figure have left the sector, with the other half joining other services. <\/p><p>Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce. The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare is now &euro;12.55 (as of May 2019), which represents a 3% increase on last year. <\/p><p>As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.<\/p><p>Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p><p>My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5 <\/i>the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families<i>.<\/i><i>First 5<\/i>recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;. <\/p><p>In particular, <i>First 5<\/i>commits to a Workforce Development Plan to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector. The Workforce Development Plan, work on which began recently, will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. <\/p><p>Preparation of the Workforce Development Plan will involve close collaboration between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills, and an extensive consultation process. To help ensure a strong consultation process, a Stakeholder Group comprising representatives from across the sector has been formed and will work alongside the Steering Group.<\/p><p>Delivering on a further commitment in <i>First 5, <\/i>I have also recently appointed an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care systems, funding and quality, economics, and policy experts from a number of Government Departments. <\/p><p>In Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the sustainability fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum. The fund will assist high quality services which are experiencing financial difficulties to transition themselves to a sustainable footing, and will also assist with needs arising in the event that the Labour Court introduces a Sectoral Employment Order, which I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue.

Officials in my Department are also working with Pobal to ensure that outstanding applications are processed as fast as possible and to remedy the causes of the delays.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, officials in my Department are in the process of finalising a Focused Policy Assessment of the ECCE Higher Capitation payments, which includes analysis of administrative procedures used in the processing of applications. It is hoped that this report, once finalised, will inform decisions on how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Higher Capitation payments.<\/p>  <p>  While I must stress that the delays in the payments are not acceptable, it is important to note that part of the reason for the delays is the large and rising volume of applications, linked to the rising number of graduates working in the sector, which is a reflection of the success of the Higher Capitation payments in supporting the professionalization of the early learning and care workforce. The proportion of ECCE services receiving Higher Capitation payments rose from 20% of services in the 2012-13 programme year to 53% of services in 2018-19. The number of applications has increased significantly in recent years, from 1,562 in 2015-16 to 2,785 in 2018-19. At the same time the proportion of applications approved rose from 83% to 97%. The number of applications approved therefore more than doubled in this 3-year period, from 1,301 in 2015-16 to 2,693 in 2018-19.<\/p>  <p>  So far (as of 4th November) in the 2019-20 programme year, Pobal have received 2,299 applications, of which 790 have been approved and 2 declined. Of the applications that have not yet been approved or declined, Pobal is actively engaging with a large number of services in relation to their applications. The number of applications is expected to continue rising over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  A significant administrative reform took place in mid-2018, with the transfer of administration of the Higher Capitation from my Department to Pobal, thus completing the transitioning of administration of the ECCE programme to Pobal, and enabling early learning and care providers to conduct all business relating to the ECCE programme with one agent.  <\/p>  <p>  On 19th August 2019, Pobal issued an announcement to services through the PIP system informing them of the Higher Capitation application timelines for the 2019-20 programme year. Regrettably these timelines resulted in a start date which was later than had been indicated the previous year and was due to a combination of resourcing issues and a delay in closing off the 2018\/2019 programme year. I understand the frustration the timelines and delays have caused.<\/p>  <p>  Pobal officials began processing applications for the programme year 2019\/2020 in October 2019, in line with the announced schedule. Pobal is currently processing a large volume of applications, and is working to approve applications and release funding as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Considering the significant pressure on services, my Department has made the decision that early learning and care providers whose applications have not yet been processed and who were also in receipt of the first preliminary payment on 23rd August 2019, would receive an additional preliminary payment on 1st November 2019. This payment was for a four-week period that will take early learning and care providers to 20th October 2019. The payment was based on a child&rsquo;s Full Time Equivalent (FTE) numbers for the week ending 18th November 2019 using the max FTE cap for services which were approved for Higher Capitation last year.<\/p>  <p>  A further preliminary payment will be made on 8th November 2019 for any early learning and care service providers whose application has still not been processed at that stage. This payment will be for a four week period that will take early learning and care service providers to the 22nd November 2019. Early learning and care service providers who had not previously been approved for the Higher Capitation rate but have submitted an application for the 2019\/2020 programme year, that has not been processed, received a preliminary payment on 29th October 2019. This payment was for an eight week period. An additional preliminary payment will also be made to these services on 8th November and this payment will be for a four week period.<\/p>  <p>  For any Higher Capitation application or payment queries, service providers are recommended to contact highercap@pobal.ie who are best placed to advise on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500106#WRXX05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":2623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500107#WRYY00300"},{"type":"question","counter":2624,"qnumday":992,"qnumall":"[44651\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500107#WRYY00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) regarding children that were harmed by HSE orthodontic services in the Dublin mid-Leinster region over a period of time; if she will request Tusla to engage with the HSE to immediately publish the report; if she will examine the matters contained in the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2625,"content":"<p>I wish to state that I have not had sight of the report to which the Deputy refers. <\/p><p>Orthodontic services are a matter for the HSE, which falls under the policy remit of my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500107#WRYY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Resource Centres","counter":2626,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500107#WRYY00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2627,"qnumday":993,"qnumall":"[44698\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500107#WRYY00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if correspondence from a person (details supplied) will be reviewed; if a 5% increase in family resource centre core funding will be granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2628,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, on 23 April 2019, I made an announcement that the additional &euro;1.5m in funding for Family Resource Centres (FRCs) was to be used this year as follows:<\/p><p><font color=\"#001A26\">- to increase core funding to each of the 110 FRCs which existed pre-2018 by 5%,<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#001A26\">- to employ an additional 17 Family Support Workers - one FRC in each of the 17 Tusla geographical areas is to be allocated funding to employ a Family Support Worker,<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#001A26\">- to fund the Family Resource Centre Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Promotion Programme.<\/font><\/p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency administers the Family Resource Centre Programme.<\/p><p>I understand that Tusla issued the promised 5% funding increase to FRCs on 11 October, 2019, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy.

Tusla is the independent statutory regulator of early learning and care and school age childcare services in Ireland. In performing its regulatory function, its actions include responding to breaches of regulations while respecting fair procedures and natural justice.  <\/p>  <p>  The suitability and safety of premises is a key concern in the assessment of quality provision for children in early learning and care settings. Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children. In August 2019, Tusla issued guidance for the registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration and change in circumstances process, which is available for download on the Tusla website. As stated in this guidance, the guidance reflects the following definition of a competent person for the purposes of a fire risk assessment: &ldquo;A person is deemed to be a competent person where, having regard to the task he or she is required to perform and taking account of the size and\/or complexity of the building or works, the person possesses sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work to be undertaken&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The guidance specifies that competent persons for the purpose of fire safety assessments are: <\/p>  <p>  (a) Architects that are on the register maintained by the RIAI under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007; or<\/p>  <p>  (b) Building Surveyors that are on the register maintained by the SCSI under Part 5 of the Building Control Act 2007; or <\/p>  <p>  (c) Chartered Engineers on the register maintained by Engineers Ireland under section 7 of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.<\/p>  <p>  In developing this guidance Tusla worked in collaboration with the Association of Chief Fire Officers in Ireland and all of the definitions and content contained therein were approved prior to publication as relevant and up to date. These definitions are reviewed on an on-going basis by Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate, in liaison with the fire representative body, and subject to amendment, in line with statutory requirements, should it be considered appropriate to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to fire safety audits, fire safety legislation and compliance with it comes under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  It should be noted that only one allowance is paid per household.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;188 million in 2019.   <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the MABS report addressing energy poverty among travellers living in mobile homes and trailers and I have asked officials in my Department to examine the recommendations in the report in relation to the fuel allowance scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household payment and can be paid when the residence is on an approved site (publically or privately owned) with planning permission for the caravan \/ mobile home.  However, where someone lives in a residence which is without planning permission such as in the case where an additional mobile home or caravan is placed on a bay designed for single use, these 'additional' places of residence are not currently legally distinct households which impacts on their eligibility for Fuel Allowance. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, I increased the Fuel Allowance payment by &euro;2 to &euro;24.50 per week.  This is an increase of just under 9% and will increase the annual Fuel Allowance rate from &euro;630 to &euro;686, i.e., a &euro;56 yearly increase.  This increase follows on from a number of other improvements and increases made to the Fuel Allowance scheme in recent Budgets including an increase from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week and the number of weeks the fuel allowance is paid for increasing from 26 to 27 and then to 28.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it is important to note that, while the Fuel Allowance increase will come into effect from the 6th January 2020, the carbon tax increase will not take effect until May 2020 for home heating fuels, giving such households additional headroom for its introduction. <\/p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance is intended to address income deficiency, not energy poverty.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, has the role of reducing energy poverty by implementing measures (administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)) to improve the energy efficiencies of Irish homes.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These income supports include the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant and the Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested  social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention. <\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.  In doing this it also contributes to recognising the valuable role of carers and helping to maintain people with caring needs in their own homes \/ communities.<\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  At the end of December 2018, there were 79,914 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that by automatically granting the allowance to all carers by removing the means test, such a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost up to an additional &euro;1.2 billion per annum.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department offers further supports to carers which are not means tested:-<\/p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child, aged under 16 with a severe disability who requires ongoing (continual or continuous) care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required (in excess of that required) by a child of the same age.  The child is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.  There are no PRSI conditions and it is not means tested.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month. <\/p>  <p>  - The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is an annual payment of &euro;1,700 a year for each care recipient paid in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test. <\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the eligibility for Carer's Allowance would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500109#WRAAA05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":2781,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500109#WRAAA05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2782,"qnumday":1049,"qnumall":"[44609\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500109#WRAAA05400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if new interim arrangements in regard to the State pension (contributory) for post-2012 pensioners that allow for extended homecaring credits and aggregated contributions will apply to all pensioners (details supplied); if legislation is needed in this regard; if so, when the legislation will be introduced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2783,"content":"<p>Initially, it should be noted that central policy relating to public service pensions rests with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These income supports include the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  At the end of December 2018, there were 35,542 people in receipt of a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  This is an increase of almost 43% since 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system, one of which is the general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  People qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment for which they are eligible.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  In 2007 a new half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was introduced for certain people with another social welfare entitlement.  This had been a particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they became carers.  The issue was highlighted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs in its Report on the Positions of Full-time Carers (2003).  In order to address these concerns, reforms in this area were provided for in Budget 2007.  Under the new arrangements, people in receipt of certain social welfare payments other than Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit who are providing full-time care and attention can retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which is equivalent to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  Therefore a person who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment, such as State-Pension (contributory), can transfer to that payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.

The Deputy will also be aware that the principal function of the Low Pay Commission is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation regarding the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence-based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  In developing its recommendation this year, the Low Pay Commission assessed various economic indicators such as changes in earnings, exchange rates, employment, unemployment, productivity, international minimum wage comparisons, the need for job creation and the likely impact of the National Minimum Wage changes on levels of employment, cost of living, and national competitiveness.  <\/p>  <p>  Numerous economic commentators, both in Ireland and overseas, have highlighted that any form of Brexit has the potential to impact negatively on the Irish economy.  Accordingly, although the Low Pay Commission recommended an increase in the national minimum wage of 30c to &euro;10.10, it did so on the assumption of an orderly Brexit, and acknowledged that the Government might wish to reserve its position in the event of a disorderly Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Government accepted the recommendation of the Commission in its entirety but decided to defer a decision on when the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation will commence until the nature of the Brexit becomes clearer.<\/p>  <p>  I intend, therefore, to make provision in the Social Welfare Budget Bill to allow me to give effect to the National Minimum Wage in respect of 2020, in line with the Commission's proposals, once the situation in respect of Brexit is clarified. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  <\/p>  <p>  As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500110#WRBBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology","counter":2809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500110#WRBBB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2810,"qnumday":1058,"qnumall":"[44710\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500110#WRBBB02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of computers in her Department that still use an operating system (details supplied) in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2811,"content":"<p>My Department utilises a wide variety of computer operating systems and associated services across its extensive ICT desktop and server environments.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.<\/p>  <p>  The interim TCA was introduced to deal with pensioners subjected to new pension ratebands introduced in September 2012 which resulted in a number of such pensioners receiving lower pension payments than pensioners prior to then.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  The allowance is increasing by &euro;2 to &euro;24.50 from January 2020 following changes announced in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  A person in receipt of a Social Security Payment from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement (of which there is an Irish equivalent payment) is eligible to apply for the fuel allowance payment on the same basis as Irish State pension recipients.  As with all other recipients of the fuel allowance, the person must satisfy a means test as well as all other qualifying conditions.  If a person is in receipt of a foreign pension other that a qualifying foreign pension as outlined above, then they will not be entitled to the fuel allowance payment.<\/p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase is a &euro;9 increase in the weekly rate of payment of certain Irish social protection payments awarded where the recipient is living alone.  These payments include State pensions, disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement and blind pension.  It is not a stand-alone payment. This payment is rising by &euro;5 to &euro;14 from January 2020 following changes announced in the budget. <\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of a State pension or other equivalent payments from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement are not currently entitled to receive the Irish living alone increase to that payment, as the respective rates of those payments to people living alone or with other people are set by national legislation in those countries.  There are no circumstances where the living alone increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The household benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 448,000 customers. <\/p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments. <\/p>  <p>  Pensioners aged between 66 and 70, who are in receipt of an equivalent social security pension from a country covered by EU Regulations or from a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement, are eligible to apply for the HHB package and would be eligible for the scheme, once he or she satisfied the relevant household conditions and the means test. <\/p>  <p>  For the household benefits package, pensioners aged 70 or over who are legally resident in Ireland are entitled to the package without being in receipt of any qualifying social welfare payment.  The package is not means-tested; however, as it a household benefit, only one person per household is eligible for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies these matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500111#WRCCC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":2900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500111#WRCCC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":2901,"qnumday":1090,"qnumall":"[45114\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500111#WRCCC05800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she is satisfied that the tender process for the public services card adhered to public procurement guidelines insofar as a company (details supplied) appears to have been the sole bidder for the second generation card contract; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2902,"content":"<p>I am satisfied that my Department has fully complied with its legal obligations under EU law and Irish law with regard to the tender process for the implementation, production, personalisation and distribution of the Public Services Card (PSC).<\/p><p>The request for tender was an open procurement which was advertised on eTenders, which is the Irish Government's electronic tendering platform administered by the Office of Government Procurement. <\/p><p>The tender process was open from 16th February 2018 to 19th of March 2018.

All tenants of houses included in the scheme who meet the eligibility criteria can apply to purchase their house, provided they are not disqualified from doing so under the provisions of the legislation.  Reasons for disqualification include rent arrears, participation in a previous tenant purchase scheme or engagement in anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Regulations governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.

The most recent amendments to the provisions were incorporated in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 with a view to further strengthening and streamlining the taking-in-charge process. <\/p>  <p>  Under section 180(1) of the Act as now constituted, where a planning authority considers that a development has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the planning permission granted, it shall, where requested by the developer or a majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 (the Roads Act) not later than 6 months after being so requested. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to developments that have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced by the planning authority within 4 years of the expiry of the planning permission relating to a development, section 180 (2)(a) of the Act now provides that the planning authority shall, where requested by the majority of owners of the houses involved, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent amendments further provide under section 180(2A) of the Act that where enforcement proceedings have not been commenced by a planning authority within 4 years of the expiration of the planning permission concerned or the planning authority considers that enforcement proceedings will not result in the satisfactory completion of the development by the developer, the planning authority may in its absolute discretion, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission concerned and where requested by a majority of the owners of the houses in question, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act. Where this approach is adopted, the authority may apply the security or bond given as part of the planning application for the satisfactory completion of the development. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 180(2A) now provides that the initiation of the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act shall not preclude the planning authority concerned from pursuing a developer for any costs incurred by that authority in respect of works undertaken on a development to enable it to be taken in charge by that authority.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the most recent amendments of the section 180 provisions were supplemented by amendments to sections 34 and 35 of the Act. In this connection, section 34 - which relates to applications for planning permission - has been strengthened to provide that planning authorities shall, in the assessment and determination of planning applications, have specific regard to previous developments by a developer which have not been satisfactorily completed as well as any previous convictions against the developer for non-compliance with the Planning Act, the Building Control Act 2007 and the Fire Services Act 1981.<\/p>  <p>  Section 35 of the Act - which relates to refusal of planning permissions for past failures - has been strengthened to empower the refusal of planning permission in situations where a developer has previously left an estate unfinished under one company name and then re-applies for permission for a new development under a different company name. <\/p>  <p>  All of these changes were specifically aimed at strengthening the taking-in-charge processes and better ensuring the satisfactory completion of housing developments, and were somewhat informed by a Private Members Bill entitled the Planning and Development (Transparency and Consumer Confidence) Bill 2013 tabled by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to make further amendments to the section 180 taking-in-charge provisions of the Act at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500114#WRFFF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Funding","counter":3059,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500114#WRFFF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":3060,"qnumday":1144,"qnumall":"[44788\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500114#WRFFF03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of new grants forthcoming towards water wells and rural water supplies; and when a new grant for such supplies will be available to applicants.","asker":"1250","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3061,"content":"<p>On 8 February this year, I announced details of the measures being funded through my Department under the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021. <\/p><p>Local authorities were subsequently invited to submit their bids for the funding of schemes or projects in their functional areas.

All planning authorities were required to develop or update, as appropriate, their policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 on the basis of the framework set out in Circular PD 1\/08.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure which can include stand-alone treatment plants. Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes.  <\/p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established consisting of representatives from this Department, Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess submissions and focus on finding solutions through collaboration between government, local authorities, Irish Water, and the EPA. <\/p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link:  www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in streamlining approaches to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water.

The multi-annual programme was initiated through the invitation of project bids from local authorities in July of this year, followed by their evaluation by an Expert Panel, set up by my Department, to independently evaluate the bid projects and make recommendations to my Department on suitable projects to be approved for funding.

Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively.

While the priority is to support families to secure a home, the Government is also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is available until a home can be provided.  In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the National Implementation Plan for Housing First is being implemented to address the needs of those individuals sleeping rough or long term users of emergency accommodation. Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies. The Plan contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of 663 tenancies to be delivered by 2021. The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering permanent solutions as new homes are delivered and house building is increasing at a significant rate.

Commercial rates, at approximately &euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly a third of local government current (revenue) income.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the critical importance of commercial rates, I prioritised the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 and it was enacted earlier this year. The Act modernises the rates system for both ratepayers and local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are required by legislation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates. <\/p>  <p>  The independent Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. Revaluation results in a redistribution of the commercial rates liability between ratepayers. While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the commercial rates collected. <\/p>  <p>  After a revaluation of a local authority area the Minister is required to make a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) to ensure that the overall rates collected in that area for the following year, does not increase beyond normal inflation and buoyancy to take account of new valuations.  RLOs have been made for each of the 16 local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and will be made in the coming weeks in respect of the eight local authorities where revaluations concluded this year. <\/p>  <p>  The final tranche of revaluations should be completed by 2021. At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. In terms of revaluations to date, I understand that the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 will further facilitate such flexible approaches, provided ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the Act also provides for rates alleviation schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and\/or local policy objectives, including for example, the implementation of the Government's Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recently wrote to all local authorities highlighting the new alleviation provisions, contained in the 2019 Act, indicating that the work in respect of commencing Section 15, is underway. Local authorities were further advised that if they plan to implement an alleviation scheme in 2020, they should make a provision in their budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500115#WRGGG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Usage","counter":3102,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500115#WRGGG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":3103,"qnumday":1162,"qnumall":"[41974\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500115#WRGGG02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will consider extending the slurry spreading deadline in counties Cavan and Monaghan as a special case due to flooding; if he has had discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3104,"content":"<p>The European Union (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2017, as amended, give legal effect in Ireland to the Nitrates Directive and to our Nitrates Action Programme.

The Act provides for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations. <\/p><p>In relation to products, Part D of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations. Technical Guidance Document (TGD) D provides guidance on means of demonstrating products are fit for purpose, this includes products which bear a CE Marking in accordance with the provisions of the Construction Products Regulation (). <\/p><p>Under the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product (which is covered by harmonised European standards or European Technical Assessments) on the EU market, to make a Declaration of Performance and affix the CE mark. In broad terms, this means that manufacturers are required to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products. For many construction products, the application of the CE mark will require the involvement of a third party (known as a &lsquo;notified body&rsquo;) to undertake certain tasks as specified in the harmonised European standard.  These tasks may include activities such as initial type-testing of products, inspection of factory production control and surveillance of factory production control.  <\/p><p>In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations, which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.<\/p><p>Currently, there are a number of harmonised European standards, and accompanying Standard Recommendations, in place in respect of insulation products, aggregates, as well as for precast concrete products and masonry products which may require aggregates for their manufacture. <\/p><p>In the first instance, it is a matter for owners, designers and builders, with responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulation, to specify the particular project specific performance requirements of products in the context of the conditions in which they are to be used.  In addition, during construction such steps as are necessary should be taken to ensure that the products provided meet these specifications and are suitable for the purpose for which they are intended. Guidance is provided in relation to this in the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, which is available at the following link: <\/p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. Building control authorities are also designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR. Similarly, market surveillance authorities are provided with wide-ranging powers to ensure that construction products placed on the market comply with the requirements set out in the CPR. These include the issuing of a notice to require corrective actions and in the event of a serious risk being identified, powers that would lead to prohibiting or restricting a construction product from being made available on the market. Issues that arise in relation to products and materials, have been and continue to be dealt with by the relevant local authorities using the powers above, this has been the case in particular in relation to product such as aggregates, concrete blocks and insulation. <\/p><p>The National Building Control Office (NBCO), within Dublin City Council, provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities.

In addition,  20% or &euro;109.3m of LPT is supporting Housing and Roads services in 2019, supplementing the considerable exchequer funding also provided for these important services. Apart from these specific self-funding allocations, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities including how to spend its LPT allocation. <\/p><p>In 2020, I expect that LPT allocations will increase to &euro;516.8m. The increase is accounted for, in the most part, by the decisions of 19 local authorities to increase their LPT rates above the basic rate for 2020.  When a local authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards (by up to 15%), it retains 100% of the resultant additional income collected in the local authority area. Likewise, when the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the income that would have been collected. The 19 local authorities that voted to increase their LPT above the basic rate are expected to gain &euro;19.7m in additional LPT income for their own use in 2020.

It also served as an opportunity to encourage the pool of qualified and experienced Irish Planners working in London to consider return to Ireland.<\/p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, including the National Planning Framework, the Government identified the achievement of compact growth as a key mechanism to support the future sustainable development of our cities and towns, addressing issues such as regional development, urban sprawl, long-distance commuting, housing supply and climate action.<\/p><p>The densification of settlements is an important part of achieving compact growth, and events such as that in London, provide an opportunity to discuss and debate the issues.  <\/p><p>Last year, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), my Department published updated apartment planning guidelines and new building height guidelines in order to encourage compact, sustainable growth in our urban areas and to further support the delivery of apartment development.<\/p><p>The updated <i>Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities<\/i>respond to changing housing need and a more dynamic urban employment market, including an aging, more diverse and internationally mobile population.  <\/p><p>The updated guidelines also set out policy in relation to a range of apartment types needed to meet the accommodation needs of a variety of household types and sizes.  This includes the introduction of the possibility of a &lsquo;Shared Accommodation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Co-Living&rsquo; format.  <\/p><p>This format, which is only one element of the guidelines, is a particular form of development that may be appropriate where responding to an identified urban housing need at particular locations.  However, co-living is not envisaged as an alternative or replacement to the more conventional apartment development.<\/p><p>While the apartment guidelines overall are designed to underpin compact growth objectives, the co-living format is intended to meet a very specific need.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, the apartment guidelines stipulate that planning authorities strike a balance between the need to provide a particular format of accommodation to respond to a specific housing need in an urban location and the overall requirement to provide quality urban apartment development as a viable long term housing option.  This is, of course, in the overall context of a range of urban and rural housing formats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Expenditure","counter":3139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":3140,"qnumday":1174,"qnumall":"[45294\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount paid by Irish Water in respect of commercial rates in 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3141,"content":"<p>Section 12 of the Water Services Act 2014 provided that the property of the public water system was not rateable.

However, the recent review of these arrangements  highlights that while they have generally been a success in providing a fast-track development consent process for developers of large-scale housing developments, the number of SHD permissions that have commenced development is less than might have been expected for the benefits being provided. <\/p>  <p>  The Review Group noted that, of the 49 SHD permissions granted between January 2018 and 30 June 2019, only 18 (37%) had been activated in some way, either through enabling works or commencement of housing construction. While the majority of the SHD permissions granted are less than one year old, and this could be a relevant consideration regarding the current low activation rate, the Review Group recommended that the Department should continue to monitor the rate of activation of SHD permissions for a further period and if the activation rate does not increase, to circa 80%, consideration could be given to the introduction of a policy measure such as a &ldquo;use-it-or-lose-it&rdquo; provision to incentivise the commencement of works.<\/p>  <p>  I have noted the finding of the Review Group regarding the lower than anticipated activation rates on foot of SHD permissions granted to date. Given the benefits for developers with regard to time savings and consistency in decision making, and taking into account the significant public resources invested in the SHD arrangements, I consider it appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission, in order to ensure the objectives of the SHD arrangements are more clearly met. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the relatively lower than expected activation rate of SHD permissions to date, and with a view to reducing the scope for the potential hoarding of sites with SHD permissions for the purpose of increasing site values, and notwithstanding the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendation to continue monitoring the activation rate for a further period, I consider that it would be timely to introduce a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; measure now. Arising from the introduction of such measure, developers in receipt of an SHD planning permission will be required to commence a certain level of development works within 18 months of the grant of permission, otherwise the permission will lapse. The necessary legislation to bring this into effect will be urgently progressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Data","counter":3170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH03600"},{"type":"question","counter":3171,"qnumday":1185,"qnumall":"[45472\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which he can authorise construction starts on various local authority housing sites nationally, with particular reference to the need for a major surge in such development in view of the increased level of demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3172,"qnumday":1189,"qnumall":"[45476\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of directly built new local authority houses allocated by the local authority to persons on the housing waiting list by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3173,"qnumday":1192,"qnumall":"[45479\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of local authorities that have sought funding from his Department for the purpose of building or purchasing local authority houses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3174,"qnumday":1195,"qnumall":"[45482\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500116#WRHHH04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he has sought or received from each local authority an up-to-date position in regard to the start-up of developments on various local authority sites nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3175,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1185, 1189, 1192 and 1195 together.<\/p><p>The delivery of new social housing is a priority for the Government as can be seen in the targeted delivery this year, of 10,000 new social homes through build, acquisition and lease, under Rebuilding Ireland.

In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation.  <\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland is delivering significant results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.
