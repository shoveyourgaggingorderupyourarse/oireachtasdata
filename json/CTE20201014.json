This is a later dated 8 October on the issue of bogus self-employment.  The previous committee considered correspondence regarding the matter raised and decided not to take the matter further in light of the fact that various State organisations have already dealt with it.  The correspondent was advised of these outcomes.  We agreed last week that we would include the issue of bogus self-employment on our work programme as part of our engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We advised the correspondent accordingly.  We have set out this course of action, but I do not think we should rule out inviting the correspondent to appear before the committee to deal with that issue again.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The witness has previously been before the Committee of Public Accounts and seems to have imparted a lot of information regarding alleged bogus self-employment.

The programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030.  That equates to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  The 2050 target is to be set in law by the Bill, which is a priority on the Government's legislative programme.  The Bill will update the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Act 2015 and is informed by the 2018 Citizens' Assembly report, the 2019 Oireachtas joint committee report on climate action, the 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government.  The Bill provides for a significantly strengthened statutory framework for governance of the climate challenge.<br\/><br\/>I will now highlight five key elements of the Bill: the national 2050 climate objective, climate action plans and strategies, carbon budgets, changes to the role and composition of the climate change advisory council and stronger Oireachtas oversight of climate policy.  The Bill puts into law a national 2050 climate objective for the State to pursue the transition to a climate-resilient and carbon-neutral economy by 2050.  A climate-neutral economy means a sustainable economy where greenhouse gas emissions are balanced or exceeded by the removal of greenhouse gases.<br\/><br\/>To enable the State to pursue the 2050 objective, the Bill provides for the making of new plans and strategies.  The national mitigation plan will be replaced by the preparation of a series of annually updated climate action plans and a series of national long-term climate action strategies.  Starting in 2021, the climate action plan will be updated annually and will provide a roadmap of actions, including sectoral actions, aligned to the period of the approved carbon budgets.  The 2021 plan will set out how we will achieve 7% emissions reduction per annum over the decade to 2030, allowing for the fact that it is not yet possible to identify all the emerging technologies, changing scientific consensus or policies, to meet the full ambition as recognised in the programme for Government.<br\/><br\/>The national long-term climate action strategy will be prepared every ten years, with an option to update it every five years if necessary, and will specify the manner in which it is proposed to achieve the 2050 objective, including an assessment of potential opportunities in relevant sectors.  In this section, all local authorities will be required to prepare a local authority climate action plan, covering both climate mitigation and climate adaptation.<br\/><br\/>The third issue I wish to highlight is carbon budgets, which will be proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council, finalised by the Minister and approved by the Government.  Each budget will set out the total amount of greenhouse gases allowed in the State within a period of five years.  The budgets will include all greenhouse gases and cover all sectors of the economy.  Carbon budgets will be made for three sequential five-year budget periods.  The grouping of the three will be called the carbon budget programme.  Each five-year budget will include sectoral decarbonisation target ranges for each sector.<br\/><br\/>As already mentioned, the Climate Change Advisory Council will have a new function to propose carbon budgets.  The future composition of the council will also change.  It will have three <i>ex officio<\/i>members, namely: the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; the director of Teagasc; and the director of Met &Eacute;ireann.  Future appointments to the council will be made having regard to the range of qualifications, experience and competence set out in the Bill; and to ensure gender balance.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas will have a new role in the development and adoption of carbon budgets, and oversight of the Government's climate performance, including against carbon budgets and sectoral decarbonisation target ranges.  All relevant Ministers will be required to give account annually to an Oireachtas joint committee, and the reporting will be informed by the Climate Change Advisory Council's annual review report; the Environmental Protection Agency's annual greenhouse gas emissions inventories and projections reports; and progress reports on the climate action plan.  Following the report by Ministers, the committee may make a series of recommendations, to which the relevant Minister will have to respond within three months.  I am happy to expand on any of these or any other elements of the Bill, and to take whatever questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carroll.

What happens if a local authority does not provide a climate action plan for what it will do in its authority area?  What happens if the plan it provides is substandard?  The level of ability varies between local authorities so who will check that plan to make sure it is up to a proper standard?

When the Bill is enacted, that will be a statutory requirement.  Over recent years, local authorities have already shown themselves to be willing and capable of producing climate adaptation plans which look at the impacts of climate change that are already locked in and at how to respond to them.  The Bill is expanding this requirement to include mitigation measures to deliver a reduction of greenhouse gases in addition to the adaptation planning authorities are already carrying out.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the standard and supports, different local authorities are resourced in different ways to take on this work, but over recent years we have developed climate action regional offices, CAROs.

I have a couple of questions.  I am a little concerned at the way in which it is proposed to deal with consultation in the legislation.  I know there is considerable interest in involvement with the consultative process.  If it is not included in this legislation, are there plans for a more comprehensive climate dialogue?  It is necessary to involve people in discussing the legislation as we move through the budgets and climate plans but we should also note that, without dialogue, people will not buy in in the way that is required for the necessary changes to be undertaken.<\/p> <p>  To move to my second question, has there been progress on the size or range of the sectoral decarbonisation targets?  If the range is made too large, one takes away some of the drive to change.  If it is made too narrow, it becomes excessively restrictive and there is a degree of uncertainty.  The committee will want to see the target range being as narrow as is reasonable. <\/p> <p>  What happens if there is a shortfall in respect of the climate budgets?  I note that, in the legislation, a shortfall of 1% can be carried on into the next period, but I am unclear on the compliance mechanisms that will apply where budget targets are missed.  There has been some commentary on this issue.  One wonders whether Departments would face budgetary restrictions.  Apart from the Oireachtas making an adverse report, how can pressure be put on sectors to comply?<\/p> <p>  On cross-government oversight, with the climate action plan, as with the Action Plan for Jobs, one of the strengths has been the role of the Department of the Taoiseach in oversight.  This is not referenced in the legislation but it seems to me that, if carbon budgetary targets are to be taken seriously, central oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach will be required.  Will that continue in the implementation of carbon budgeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#B00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I will deal with each of those questions in turn.  The first question the Deputy asked was on consultation.  The importance of consulting and bringing people with us is fully recognised.  The legislation provides that the Minister may consult as appropriate in bringing forward plans and strategies and the intention is to do so.  With particular regard to local authorities, which are probably the structures closest to local communities, section 12(5) of the Bill provides that local authorities will need to publish draft local authority climate action plans, publish a notice on the Internet and invite members of the public and any interested parties to make submissions in writing with regard to the proposed plan.  That puts a very specific onus on local authorities to consult at the local level.<\/p> <p>  More generally, there are plans for a wider climate dialogue.  Three pillars to this were identified.  One related to the capacity of government, the Civil Service and the public service to communicate consistent messages to the public.  The second related to periodically convening all key stakeholders at a national level to inform the making of policy.  The third and probably most important pillar related to local engagement geared towards activation, that is to say, engaging with people at a local level.  As a structure, the local authorities will obviously have a key role in that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was on progress on the size of the decarbonisation ranges.  That work will progress over the coming period in the context of the preparation of the carbon budgets and the next iteration of the climate action plan.  I fully accept the Deputy's point that if the ranges are too broad, they may facilitate lesser ambition and if they are too narrow, they may be overly prescriptive.  That is something through which we will have to work.  Ranges will have to be managed so that the sum of the sectoral efforts will allow us to reach the target required to remain within the carbon ceiling for the particular budgetary period.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the banking and borrowing provisions, which was the third issue the Deputy raised, we followed the approach taken in the UK.  They allow for the amount by which a sector came in under a ceiling in a given budgetary period to be carried forward to the next period.  This was considered a prudent approach which could incentivise early action.  A much more conservative approach was taken with regard to borrowing.  If a sector exceeds its carbon ceiling in a given budgetary period, the amount it can bring forward or borrow from a future budgetary period to compensate is limited to 1% of the budget for the period from which it is borrowed.  That was the approach taken in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The last issue the Deputy raised was the issue of compliance mechanisms where budgetary targets are missed.  Primary accountability under the Bill is to the Oireachtas, whose role is to make reports and recommendations.  The Minister is also required to respond and to take corrective action.<\/p><p>In addition, at an EU level, if we exceed our EU carbon ceilings or fail to hit our targets again, we will be exposed to purchasing compliance.  Administrative arrangements could be made to distribute that purchasing cost across the relevant sectors that are not hitting their targets.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned cross-Government oversight and the delivery board.  The intention is that the delivery board will continue to be co-chaired by the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Environment, Climate and Communications, and the quarterly reporting will continue against the actions set out in the climate action plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>For members who have just joined us, I ask them to indicate their intent to speak through the Chair and I will fit them in.

There has been quite a lot of criticism of the language of the Bill, as it is frequently very vague.  There are many questions as to why that is.  For example, it uses the phrase \"have regard to\" 11 times and \"may\" 43 times.  In comparison, the Bills that have been issued in New Zealand and Scotland use much more determined language.  Instead of using words like \"pursue\", they use \"achieve\".  Is the reason for this vague language to allow loopholes for the Government in case it is legally challenged in the future if it fails to deliver on the emissions cuts?<\/p> <p>  My second question is about just transition.  Mr. Carroll spoke about bringing people along but there is no mention of just transition in the Bill.  From my understanding, in order to achieve a reduction in emissions one has to bring people along through just transition because climate change is also very much a matter of social justice rather than just science.  We need to bring people, like the Bord na M&oacute;na workers and those who need retrofitting of their homes, with us.  Why is the question of just transition deliberately left out of the Bill?  Is it just an error?<\/p> <p>  There is a provision for gender balance and so on on the Climate Change Advisory Council but there is no provision for representatives of campaigns, of which there are many, around biodiversity, ecology and climate change, representatives of trade unions or workers who may be affected by the changes that this Bill will hopefully bring in.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the programme for Government refers to a 7% reduction in emissions each year to 2030.  Can Mr. Carroll explain the difference, if there is any, between this and the Bill's reference to carbon neutrality by 2050?  Does this mean the actual cuts in emissions will be balanced or accounted for in some way with sinks, credits for the future or the removal of gases via future technology which we do not have?  Science is very dubious about the carbon capturing technology that is vaguely referred to in the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#C00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was on whether the language in the Bill was designed to create loopholes.  The answer to that is &quot;No&quot;.  It was not.  One of the issues that has been mentioned is linking the 2050 target to the climate action plans and carbon budgets.  That is quite clearly done in terms of the 2050 climate objective.  The Bill reads: &quot;The State shall pursue the transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy by the end of the year 2050.&quot;  The word &quot;pursue&quot; means to follow, chase, continue or proceed to achieve that target by 2050.  Section 3(2) clearly links the achievement of that target to the preparation of climate action plans and long-term strategies.  It states that for the purpose of enabling the State to pursue the national 2050 objective, the Minister will make climate action plans and national long-term climate action strategies and in doing so, under section 3(3)(<i>r<\/i>), the Minister is required to take account of the carbon budget programme.  There is quite a tight linking of the target with the making of plans and strategies and the creation of a carbon budget.  I do not see loopholes there.<br\/><br\/>As regards just transition, section 3(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Bill highlights climate justice as one of the things that has to be taken into account by the Climate Change Advisory Council and Ministers.  The committee must consider it in advising on carbon budgets and the Government more generally must do so in adopting carbon budgets and preparing climate action plans and long-term strategies.  Climate justice very much incorporates a just transition nationally and quite a bit of policy has been brought forward already by the Government to address this in a relatively short period of time.  Some of those pieces, such as the appointment of the just transition commissioner, have already been mentioned.  Decisions have already been made about &euro;20 million for energy efficiency retrofitting in the midlands and &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside the Bord na M&oacute;na estate.  A dedicated just transition fund will make &euro;11 million available to fund innovative projects in the midlands and &euro;15 million has been committed as part of the July stimulus to retrofit 33,000 ha of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands, which will act as a carbon sink.  A feasibility study is about to be started on establishing a green energy hub using existing infrastructure in west Offaly and Lough Ree power stations.  There is quite a bit of activity already under way regarding just transition,<br\/><br\/>The Deputy mentioned gender balance and the provisions around gender balance are strengthened in the Bill.  As regards the other considerations she listed, there is a long list of characteristics, competencies and expertise that are required from potential members of the Climate Change Advisory Council, including climate science, transport, energy and policy, and behavioural and communications science.  Experience of biodiversity and ecosystems services, to which the Deputy made particular reference, are included in that list.  Economics, finance, political sociology and ethics in relation to climate are also considered, as well as the importance of gender balance.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised the relationship between the 7% per annum on average reduction over the decade, the 55% reduction at EU level and the 2050 target.  Basically, the 7% per annum over the decade equates to the 55% the EU is proposing for 2030.  It is consistent with achieving carbon or climate neutrality by 2050, which is the objective set out in the Bill.  It will involve sinks as well as technologies to reduce our production of greenhouse gases.  As regards concerns, one has to account for the fact that the period out to 2050 is a 30-year period.  There is a degree of uncertainty around how science and technology will develop over that time.  There is a lot of research going on in the area of climate mitigation.<\/p><p>Obviously, nature-based solutions, such as carbon sinks and rewetting peatlands, will have a huge role to play in balancing certain greenhouse gases.  In addition, one would expect scientific progress over the three decades, which will bring forward further solutions that we do not yet have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>That is a form of wishful thinking.

It is welcome to see progress on this important Bill, for which we have awaited for a long time.  I see the committee's role as one of making the Bill as strong as possible.<\/p> <p>  I view the Bill with completely sceptical eyes because I want to make it very robust to ensure it will not only withstand this term of Government but will also reach forward and be used well into the future.  I look at it as if it has been implemented by a Minister who is a complete climate denier.  I want it to be very strong legislation.  There are a few areas where the Bill needs to be strengthened.  My colleague mentioned the language used, which I believe is very loose.  It will be difficult to hold anyone to account for certain aspects of the Bill.  The 2015 Act used language such as \"to pursue, and achieve, the transition\" to a low carbon economy, whereas this Bill refers to pursuing that.  That is very much a weakening of the language.  There are also issues with the Paris Agreement in that the Bill must only have regard to the agreement.  There are areas in the Bill where we need to strengthen the language to ensure we have accountability going forward.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the absence of interim targets.  How we get to 2050 is very important.  There needs to be an obligation to have interim targets, stick to them and, where necessary, correct course if the Government is failing to meet them.  That is not provided for and it is definitely a weakness in the Bill.  There also needs to be a binding duty to meet the interim targets.<\/p> <p>  There is a big gap in the Bill when it comes to the just transition.  Mr. Carroll indicated that climate justice covers the just transition but traditionally climate justice has a more global understanding.  It is important to include climate justice in the Bill as well as the voices of the people who will be most impacted by the legislation.  We must ensure their voices are heard in the development and implementation of the Bill and the policies that will support it.  It is important that we bring people along with us as it is the only way we will achieve any climate measures. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Carroll stated the Bill would ensure gender equality and gender balance on the advisory council.  That is not the case as the text provides that the \"best endeavours\" must be used.  Again, that is loose language which will not achieve what we hope to achieve.<\/p> <p>  While the Bill includes a long list of areas of expertise, members of the advisory committee must have knowledge of only one of these areas.  Theoretically, therefore, we could have an advisory committee full of economists or engineers.  We need to ensure there is a spread of expertise. <\/p> <p>  I would like to see a reflection of nature-based solutions in the Bill.  Nature-based solutions and the biodiversity crisis are two heads of the same coin.  While I welcome the amendment to the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, I would also like to see that reflected in the primary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#D00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I responded to earlier comments on language.  I think the language is strong in the Bill and clearly links the target to climate action plans, strategies and carbon budgets.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the long-term strategy in particular, the Bill refers to a strategy \"to specify the manner in which it is proposed to achieve the national 2050 climate objective.\"  That is fully consistent with the 2015 Act and it is something the Supreme Court, in its recent decision, dwelt on, including what it means.  The requirement to specify remains in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  In terms of interim targets, a few issues can be mentioned.  First, the programme for Government contains a commitment to 7% reductions per annum, on average, over the decade.  Second, once we have in place carbon budgets and sectoral decarbonisation ranges, we have a very tight structure of interim targets over five-year periods with specific sectoral requirements also delineated in terms of the quantum of reduction that will be expected across sectors.<\/p> <p>  On the just transition, I refer again to my earlier response that climate justice has been included as something that is required for consideration.  I take the Deputy's point that climate justice has three dimensions, namely, a global piece, an intertemporal piece and a national piece, as I think it is commonly understood.  The national piece really speaks to just transition and Government policy is quite active in this area, as I outlined.<\/p> <p>  I also agree that it is very important that the voices of the people impacted by the transition to climate neutrality are heard, and those of wider society.  The provision that the Minister may consult, the particular requirements around consultation at local level and the separate development of a national dialogue on climate will all facilitate the hearing of those voices and ensure that people have an input into the making of policy.  <\/p> <p>  On the climate change advisory council, the long list of potential expertise and competencies was included with the intention of creating a wider mix of skills on the council.  It is envisaged that the list would be understood and implemented in that way. <\/p> <p>  The provisions on gender equality are stronger than those in the 2015 Act.  I do not have the exact reference in the Act but nature-based solutions are explicitly called out.

Previous speakers raised the very important issue that just transition is not named in the heads of the Bill.  I suggest that a new paragraph (z) be added to section 3 after paragraph (y).  That would be a natural place to insert a paragraph on just transition as there seems to be a gap there.  Just transition is not the same as climate justice.  Both terms need definition because they are not abstract concepts.  Just transition, for example, has been defined by the International Labour Organization, ILO, as reflected in the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The Bill refers to the Minister and Government having regard to certain factors.  More important, however, there seems to be a walking back from concrete, solid commitments Ireland has already made.  Why is there not an interim target in the Bill?  Mr. Carroll stated the intention was to achieve a 7% reduction in emissions every year and reach a certain reduction by 2030.  Why is this not provided for in the Bill?  Why should we, as legislators, not want to see it in the Bill?  We would then have a bird in the hand rather than relying on what future birds there might be and what future bushes might remain.  Interim targets have to be dealt with in the Bill.  Why is there not a separate section on this?<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of clarity.  Subsection (4) of the new section 3 states: \"For the purposes of performing their functions under sections 6B and 6D the Minister and the Government shall have regard to the matters specified at paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (3).\"  It does not state that the Minister will not have regard to all the other caveats and issues.  Is Mr. Carroll suggesting that in the case of sections 6B and 6D, the Minister will only have regard to the factors specified in paragraphs (a) to (d), the greenhouse gas emissions inventory and others?<\/p> <p>  Why are we speaking about article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCC?  What about the other articles?  Has it been decided not to worry about them?  Where is article 4, for example, which commits to having the highest possible ambition in achieving the goals?  That is a real concern.  We signed up to the UNFCC.<\/p> <p>  What of the mitigation or adaptation commitments and the European Union targets?  We speak of them as obligations.  If they are obligations, why are they not in the Bill?  I seek the rationale for not putting a strong 2030 target in the Bill?  It seems to be legislatively poor and inconsistent with the agreements we have made and other obligations we have signed up to.  Another problem arising from the absence of a 2030 target is that the sustainable development goals, which are part of Agenda 2030, have vanished and are not in the Bill.  There is a provision for sustainable development but nothing about the sustainable development goals, which are a concrete set of specifically relevant measures.  The goals on climate but also on sustainable cities would surely be relevant to the Bill and the roadmaps being drawn up.  Those are 2030 targets.  Is the Department's focus on one date, 2050, the reason it has left out the sustainable development goals and related targets and commitments?<\/p> <p>  I have other concerns on which I will not have time to dwell.  Value for money is not defined.  We know there is significant movement in this area.  Even in procurement, we now use terms such as the \"most economically advantageous\", \"price-quality ratio\" and so on.  \"Value for money\" is an outdated term that is not usually used.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly concerned by the line, \"the policy of the Government on climate change\".  This is placed on a par with what we signed up to at the UN and EU.  If the policy of a future government on climate change is that it is not especially worried about it, will that cancel out everything?  We pass legislation all the time in these Houses and it is not usual practice to have a get-out-clause for any future government, one that provides for action unless of course the particular Minister does not really want to act.  That is an extraordinarily unusual legislative measure.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned also about the inclusion of the phrase \"carbon leakage\".  This goes against clear language requirements.  A definition must be included.  This is not a commonly used phrase and I suggest it is intentionally confusing.  If I asked any member of the public what carbon leakage means, no one would say it means we have to compete with people or we will lose business.  That is not what people would think it meant.  They would think it means emissions.  We need to have clear language.  If the Department wants to include the word \"competition\", it should do so and we will try to take it out.  If it want to talk about non-territorial emissions, let us put that in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  All of my questions are on the legislative aspects of the Bill.  I am extremely concerned by the suggestion that in the wonderful scenario where emissions in a previous budget period fall below the target, that is, we reduce emissions by more than the set target, we will carry them over and use them in the next five years.  How is that compatible with the highest possible ambition and the principles of climate justice?  When drafting this Bill we need to remember that not only can we not negotiate with the coronavirus, we cannot negotiate with climate.  There cannot use Christmas and birthday logic or a promise to pay on Tuesday.  We need to nail this down.<\/p> <p>  People have said there is no clear accountability in this Bill.  I am not interested in looking back in 2050 and asking which of the in-between Ministers was responsible or whether the advisory committee was responsible.  As legislators, we are responsible for the legislation.  That is what we need to answer for.  I would like us to know that the legislation is succeeding by 2030.  Perhaps Mr. Carroll will address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#E00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I remind all members that their five-minute slot is for questions and answers.

The Senator mentioned that on the long list of factors to be taken into account was Government policy on climate change.  Government policy on climate change currently is to have a 7% average reduction per annum over the decade.  That part of the Bill actually hardwires a link between Government policy - the 7% annual reduction - and what is required to be taken into account in the Bill in terms of bringing forward plans and strategies in carbon budgets.<\/p> <p>  On article 2, it was highlighted as being the overarching objective.  I accept, however, that there are other objectives in there.  It was highlighted as being the overarching piece in that particular UN document.  With regard to why the EU targets are not included, our legal advice is very clear that where an existing legal obligation has been imposed under EU law, it is not appropriate to further put the same obligation into national law.  EU obligations rest on us as the EU requirement, and it is not appropriate to put it then as a further national legal obligation.<\/p> <p>  Sustainable development was put into the Bill.

That piece is important.<\/p><p>In terms of taking account of Government policy, I think I have mentioned that already.  That means the 7% per annum, on average over the decade, has to be taken into account.  It is there in the Bill as one of the factors to be considered.  On page 28, I think the Senator was concerned about the question of banking in the case of overachievement in the first five-year carbon budget.  There is an option to do that; it is not a requirement.  It is consistent with approaches in other jurisdictions and it can be regarded as a motivation to early climate action.  Finally, in terms of the clear lines of accountability, the Minister and Government are accountable to the Oireachtas in respect of the carbon budgets and how emissions progress, and whether they are sticking to the carbon budgets.

I have a technical question, however before I ask it.  I wish to ask Mr. Carroll what his view is on the comment that this Bill represents a weakening in comparison with the 2015 legisation.  Purely factually, looking at the terminology in 2015 in comparison with this Bill, we are talking about net-zero emissions, and there is no numerical figure in the 2015 legislation.  I do not believe I have heard any of the advocacy groups say that there is a weakening in comparison to 2015; the reverse is the case, if anything.  However, there is a point on which I would like clarity, and that is the direct comparison between the Scottish legislation and the legislation we have before us here.  If we look at section A1 in the Scottish legislation, it states: \"Scottish Ministers must ensure that the net Scottish emissions account for the net-zero emissions target year is at least 100% lower than the baseline\". This is in comparison with the legislation before us, which as Mr. Carroll is aware, states: \"The State shall pursue the transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy\".  I am wondering, from a technical perspective, rather than the ins and outs of which is correct, what would it take for us, not just to amend that particular section, but what else in the Bill would need to change in order to give effect to the strengthening of that language?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#F00800","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator that the Bill is not weakened relative to the 2015 legislation, and in fact it is strengthened.

In my opening statement, I talked about what climate neutrality means, in particular in relation to greenhouse gases, where greenhouse gas emissions are balanced or exceeded by the removal of greenhouse gases in 2050.  I think that is a very strong statement of where we need to be.  It is not just balanced, it is balanced or exceeded.

It is also acknowledged that on the Climate Change Advisory Council that there is scope to have representatives with expertise in biodiversity and nature-based solutions.  I am wondering is there a reason we are steering away from the different methodologies?  When Mr. Carroll referred to the Act in his response to Deputy Whitmore, was he referring to the 2015 Act, when he said that nature-based solutions were included and mentioned?  If that is not the case, is there scope, under section 3, for the inclusion of some text referring to and acknowledging the importance of biodiversity and nature-based solutions?  In the direction that we take in reducing our carbon emissions, battling climate change and stemming the devastation to biodiversity and wildlife nationally and worldwide, it is important that we acknowledge it in some form within the Bill.<\/p><p>That is my question.

Let us compare it to the likes of NPHET where one has very great expertise in public health.  It provides the advice and then the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas decide to balance that out with other concerns, whereas this body seems to contain a balance of views within it.  Is there a hierarchy for the climate scientists, who are the experts, and can we choose to look at their advice?  I wonder how the balance is going to be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Equally, I have concerns about how we will do the auditing of the reductions in emissions versus how much will be reliant on sequestration and technologies, including bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, BECCS.  How will we do the accounting process given that much of the technology is uncertain?<\/p> <p>  I have concerns also on why the Bill relies heavily on the UK Climate Change Act 2008, given that the ground has moved extensively since then.  Why did we not take more from our neighbours in Scotland or even from the New Zealand Act?  The Department chose to take the 1% borrowing, which is very much part of the UK Climate Change Act, but it did not choose to add all of the references to accountability and the objects of duty that come with the borrowing from that Act.

Mr. Carroll's previous comment was that all of the accountability is to the Oireachtas, which is fair to a point.

One of the enduring calls from many who are committed to climate action is to see embedded in legislation targets and carbon budgets.  This has been the defect in our approach to tackling climate change for many years and it has allowed issues such as climate to be overlooked by successive policy makers.  Does Mr. Carroll agree this is path-breaking legislation?  While there can be improvement in some of the wording as we proceed on Committee Stage it would be a mistake for the committee to regard this as in some way diluting commitments.  This creates a vehicle to drive change in the area.  This message should come out of the committee hearings as well as the undoubted scope for improvement in some of the drafting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#J00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>There are questions and comments from a number of members and I invite Mr. Carroll to deal with them now as best he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#J00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I will start with Deputy Bruton's question and comment because they speak to some of the other points raised.  I agree with Deputy Bruton's views, in particular regarding some of the concerns raised about 7% per annum on average being in a programme for government and how locked-in this ambition is.  Deputy Bruton is absolutely correct when he says that when we have our first two carbon budgets of the series of three they will cover the period from 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030 and they will have to lock in the ambition in the programme for government.  There is no provision to change these budgets, except in very exceptional circumstances where there has been a change in the climate science that warrants such a change or if we have new binding international or EU targets.  Absolutely the carbon budgets will lock in the ambition in a very hard way.<\/p> <p>  I will not go back to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who was the first in and asked about the distinctive characteristics of biogenic methane.  It is produced through biological processes from waste or animals and it has some distinct characteristics.  Its life in the atmosphere is estimated to be 12 years, compared to carbon or CO2, which lasts from a century to a millennium in the atmosphere.  Its global warming potential is higher than that of carbon.  It is approximately 28 times higher.  The other piece about biogenic methane, and it is consistent with the UN thinking, is that while we have technological solutions to get our carbon emissions to zero by 2050 there will be residual biogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions.  What we are aiming for is that they will be balanced by the creation of sinks and nature-based solutions and other ways of removing them from the atmosphere.<\/p> <p>  The next set of comments related to climate scientists-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>My question was not to ask Mr. Carroll for the distinction between CO2 and biogenic methane.

They come through the budgets which can be revised in the exceptional circumstance of there being some sort of new obligation that requires them to be possibly further tightened.  On that balance between having something very locked down and sufficient flexibility, if one puts a particular target for 2030 into primary legislation now but science dictates that, through our international obligations, it has to be a more stringent target in the coming years of the decade, one will obviously have to amend the primary legislation to reflect that.  There is already a mechanism through the carbon budgets to ensure that one can reflect any further or heightened ambition that may come down the line through a revision of those carbon budgets, if there are new obligations or changes in climate science.

We chose it because what we will need to manage this crisis is solidarity, a willingness to compromise, pragmatism and co-operation.  The guiding principles of our programme and Presidency are that we really try to permanently overcome the Covid-19 pandemic and have an economic recovery.  We want a stronger and more innovative Europe; a fair and sustainable Europe; and a Europe of security and common values, which is also a strong Europe in the world.<\/p> <p>   Our foreign Minister said, at the start of the Presidency, that we want to be a driving force and a facilitator in building bridges to jointly make progress in this endeavour.  We know that the German Presidency faces very high expectations.  We are ambitious.  We want to work in unity and solidarity in the remaining months as we did since July.  At the same time we must remain realistic about what we can achieve in the remaining six months of this Presidency.  We are focusing on nine priorities but due to time constraints concerning opening statements I will briefly talk about a few of them. <\/p> <p>  Overcoming the pandemic is central and managing the economic recovery takes centre stage.  Agreeing on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the next generation EU, that is the recovery fund, is very important for us.  The German Chancellor, Mrs. Merkel, has often said that extraordinary situations needs extraordinary measures.  We want to make sure that this happens and that the money can flow by 2021 so we are working very hard to reach an agreement with the European Parliament.  So far, about seven meetings at political level have taken place.  Our aim is to finalise the procedures as soon as possible.  Also, we want to improve co-ordination within the EU and I am sure that the members have seen the recent developments there.  <\/p> <p>  The next big issue, which is very important to Ireland, is concluding the negotiations on a future relationship with the United Kingdom.  Yesterday, the Chancellor spoke at the EU Committee of the Regions where she again stressed the agreement is in everyone's interest, that the EU remains united in the fight for that agreement but that we also have to be prepared for a no-deal outcome.<\/p><p>She stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe want an agreement: from the Irish point of view in particular it is extremely important. We won't let Ireland down but will continue to stick together in these negotiations.  But we have to bear in mind the realities because an agreement has to be in the interests of both sides, in the British interest and in the interest of the EU's 27 member states. <\/blockquote><p>Our Minister for Foreign Affairs most recently warned against a failure of the negotiations calling a no-deal outcome completely irresponsible and underlining that we want a close and ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom.  Yesterday, Michel Barnier briefed the General Affairs Council on that and he will brief the European Council tomorrow and the day after.  Unity remains important to us and we will keep negotiating.  As members may know, Ursula von der Leyen will speak to Boris Johnson by telephone this afternoon.  We will keep the process going but significant difficulties remain.  Talks are at a critical stage, as our Minister of State for Europe also underlined.  I will happy to discuss that in greater detail later. <br\/><br\/>I will briefly touch on a few more issues that are priorities for the German Presidency.  On migration and asylum policy, yesterday the Chancellor said that we want to move forward.  She spoke of our &quot;humanitarian duty&quot; with regard to what happened in the Moria camp.  She believes it is a burden on Europe that agreement has not yet been reached and stated the Commission's proposal was well worthy of discussion.  A compromise is needed, she said, and each member state will have to contribute to a fair solution.  The debate has started between the member states based on the Commission proposal for a new pact on migration and asylum.  We hope we can make progress and agree on that. <br\/><br\/>The next very important issue to Germany is the rule of law.  We believe Europe should be at the forefront on climate protection and digitisation.  Germany supports the aim of a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.  We want to work on producing climate legislation within a year.  Other topics are digitisation, Europe's role in the world and the relationship with Africa, which will also be discussed at the European Council this week.<br\/><br\/>For us, it is very important that citizens are on board.  That is why we pay great attention to having a conference on the future of Europe.  We would love to see that conference kick-started during our Presidency but we will have to see whether the pandemic will allow us to do so.  As the Chancellor said, this is an excellent opportunity to talk to our citizens about what they wish to happen in the future and how we can reach that aim.  We would like it to be a wide-ranging debate on our joint future in Europe.  With that, I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

During the previous D&aacute;il, we had very close relations with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  The committee's Portuguese counterparts paid a visit, as did the Portuguese minister of state with responsibility for European affairs.  A visit to Lisbon by members of this committee was on the horizon at the beginning of this year but, unfortunately, it had to be postponed due to Covid.  I hope it will take place very soon.<\/p> <p>  Relations between Portugal and Ireland are excellent and we are trying to give them more content.  We are on the same side and share the same position in like-minded groups on lots of topics which tells us that there is a wide scope for co-operation in the future.  The first meetings between the two committees on European affairs showed that both sides are interested in dialogue.<\/p><p>That will allow an exchange of views and, more than that, of experience, and the opportunity for each side to present to the other one the specificities that exist on each side.<\/p><p> We hope that there will be an agreement with the UK.  Like Germany and Ireland, we are very committed to finding a balanced agreement with the UK.  I remind the committee that we are the oldest standing alliance between the UK and another country.  The Anglo-Portuguese alliance dates from the 14th century.  That is something that has lasted but has had its ups and downs.  The United Kingdom is one of our major investors and we have a large community of British people living in Portugal, so it is in our interest to have a close relationship and partnership, but as my German colleague said, in the end there must be a fair agreement and the Irish question must not be sacrificed on the altar of an agreement.  Since the very beginning, we shared the Irish concerns and that will continue.<\/p><p> Regarding the Presidency, I will be brief because now the system is that we have a trio of Presidencies.  Slovenia, Portugal and Germany established a working programme for 18 months.  It will be the second half of this year and the two semesters of next year.  We identified a set of priorities which mirror a common vision for Europe.  As usual, this programme is a general framework, a document that is established in broad lines and is being adapted, but there is more consensus than usual currently.  I know that today my Minister will meet with his counterparts in the Portuguese Parliament to brief them on the progress that is being made and how that reflects on our Presidency.  There is very intense dialogue between our government, our Minister for European affairs and our foreign Minister regarding the programme for the Presidency we are preparing, but now we have more question marks.  We have a programme but we have a lot of question marks and, as usual, we are waiting to see what happens in the Presidency and after December.  I am ready to come next year - I hope it will be on a more sound ground - to tell the committee what our semester will look like.<\/p><p> The stage belongs completely to Germany now and Portugal is strongly supporting it because its success is our success and, as members can see, our priorities are very similar.  They are in line and complete each other.  Given that, I can state that the future Portuguese Presidency of the EU has established as the main priority for its semester to reinforce the resilience of Europe and to restore our citizens' confidence in the European social model, based on the promotion of a Union that is solidly anchored on shared values of solidarity, convergence and cohesion.  Our action plan is structured around several pillars: a Europe of resilience and solidarity that is prepared to face future crises and the reinforcement of investment and the economic recovery will be at the core of our action.<\/p><p>The German Presidency is developing excellent work on this, and preparing the instruments.  Afterwards, we will deal with implementation and ensure that all of the innovative instruments that are needed for a successful European recovery and the reinforcement of European resilience are urgently implemented.  We will be preparing conditions to promote all the initiatives aimed at mitigating the crisis impacts and to ensure a successful development of the plans for economic recovery, to promote growth and employment and to anchor the recovery on the European climate pact and digital transition.<\/p><p> The reinforcement of European solidarity and European shared values will be another requirement to ensure balanced European construction.  We are talking about the reinforcement of democracy and the rule of law, the promotion of human rights and fundamental liberties and the improvement of the European response to emergency situations such as the ones we are facing.<\/p><p> Social Europe will be one of our main priorities.  The development of a stronger social Europe in our economic recovery trajectory will be at the heart of the future programme of the Portuguese Presidency, which believes that in a difficult environment such as the one caused by the pandemic, it is more important than ever to reinforce the European social model as the motor for growth and to ensure that social rights are perceived by citizens as a palpable reality, a benefit deriving from Europe.  We are always talking about the fact that Europe must reach out to its citizens.  If they have palpable proof that it acts positively in their everyday life that will help to solidify our common project.  It will entail several actions on a wide range of issues, ranging from mechanisms for the mitigation of unemployment impacts on professional formation and learning, and responding to the social impacts resulting from energy and digital transition because this crisis came at a moment when we were already seeing that the whole world was in a phase of transition and that we needed to ensure that all citizens are on board.  That is even more so the case since the crisis.  The situation has become more complex and we must look into it.  There are also demographic challenges.  A very important point that is complementary with the others is the fight against poverty and social exclusion given that now, in this transition phase, the risk of that happening has increased.<\/p><p> A green Europe and the pursuit of economic recovery on a sustainable basis is our second priority.  We have our green transition.  The other day, President von der Leyen had very nice words for the changes we made.  We were very committed to decarbonise our economy and to develop renewables and clean energy and we are quite advanced in that regard.  We are to the forefront in Europe and that is one area in our bilateral relations where we have lots of scope for talk and co-operation.  We need to improve our capability to adapt to the effects of climate change and promote the benefits of being carbon free and having a resilient economic model.  Other measures in that regard include the promotion of the European climate pact, the adaptation to climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, the improvement of forests, water and waste management, to conclude CAP reform, and to promote innovation and digitalisation in the rural world, as well as the sustainable management of natural resources.<\/p><p>This work has been started by the German Presidency and we will follow this work to which we will make our input and contribution.<\/p><p> For a country such as Portugal, which faces the sea, the committee will not be surprised to learn that the development of the blue economy is also a matter we hold close to our heart.  This year, we were supposed to welcome the United Nations Ocean Conference but it had to be postponed.  We hope it can take place next year and that not only will it be a major political event but it will also gather the environmental organisations that are active on the oceans as well as businesses at the side events.<\/p><p> I mentioned already a digital Europe because it is everywhere and will be important internally and externally.  It will also be an important part of our partnership with Africa because we have to enable African countries to manage their own development if we are creating a partnership.  I will provide more detail on that later if members want.<\/p><p> On a global Europe, our vision is similar to the one my German colleague expressed.  Africa is important.  We are committed to creating a true partnership.  A summit was due to take place on this but we do not know now when it will take place.  Otherwise, we hope it can be done during Portugal's Presidency of the EU.  It was established that we would have a business and technological forum so that we can put those worlds in contact with each other and that directly forms co-operation in a sense.  The meeting with India will also be important.  There is supposed to be a meeting between the Indian Prime Minister and the European Council, which we hope will take place.  There are lots of other events and international meetings that now have a big question mark over them.<\/p><p> I mention the political neighbourhood, the eastern partnership and the relationship with Asia, mainly China.  This will be important, as will the relationship with Latin America, where we have a historical presence and of which we have knowledge.  We are keen to bring the two continents closer.  We also want to ensure we have a voice in international forums, namely, human rights forums and other forums that are close to the core of our values.  That is where we can defend and promote those values and our economic interests.  The World Trade Organization is one such forum..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

There is an awful lot to cover and I have a million questions.  Thankfully, Senator Chambers has asked a few of those questions so I will not repeat her excellent points.<\/p> <p>  Both of our guests mentioned Europe's place in the world.  Mr. de Almeida e Sousa mentioned the eastern partnership but I want to ask about a country that is a bit closer, which is also to the east.  I would appreciate the witnesses' opinions on the situation in Belarus and on the possibility of new sanctions being introduced at this week's European Council meeting.  Even though it was an achievement to agree sanctions on Belarus at the last European Council meeting, I was massively disappointed at the fact that they were relatively narrow and that President Lukashenko was left off them.  I know the German Foreign Minister, in particular, has been outspoken on this but I would like to get Ms Potzel's insight into what we might be able to expect in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the future of Europe, which Senator Chambers mentioned, I would appreciate it if the witnesses could flesh out what preparations, if any, have been undertaken in their countries at a Government and parliamentary level to feed into a confidence in the future of Europe as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue that dominates many minds in this country and across the water when we go away from the pandemic and the budget, namely Brexit.  I am aware that it is not necessarily the biggest issue in other European countries.  We had the fuss over the UK's Internal Market Bill being released at a late hour and it dominated British headlines.  It was the third item on the Irish news but I do not know if it even registered in the news in Portugal or Germany.  Other colleagues I speak to in member states across the EU have all moved on.  Brexit happened on 31 January.  It is difficult for a country such as this, which is so close to the UK and with a shared land border with the UK, to simply move on.  I would appreciate hearing what the impressions of Brexit are in Portugal and Germany.  Where do the witnesses see the potential of the future relationship between the EU and Britain?  I know this issue was touched on earlier and it is vital that we have some form of a future relationship, even if a deal looks less likely at this stage.  In that context, when we talk about recovery and the pandemic, what consideration can the MFF make to the impact that Brexit will have, how it can compound the economic impact of the pandemic and where that might affect the European recovery fund and the approach to Ireland, in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#K00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I will start by picking up on Senator Chambers's question on migration.  For a number of reasons, including the refugee crisis we faced in 2015, that is a major topic for us.  We need to stand together in solidarity to alleviate the burden on the front-line countries and we need to find a sustainable European refugee and migration policy.  A restart is needed and that restart must be based on solidarity and on a shared responsibility, both in the internal and external dimensions.  Internally, we are aiming for a common European asylum system, whichensures responsibility sharing and efficiency; curbs secondary migration; lives up to humanitarian standards and fundamental European values; and as I said, truly alleviates the burden on the front-line member states.  We want to progress on those issues.<\/p><p>The debate has started between the member states based on the Commission proposal for a new pact on migration and asylum, and we feel that it is a very good basis.  As the committee will know, it is based on strengthening the externality mentioned, effective protection of the external borders and a fair sharing of the burden through a system of very effective solidarity.  As for the externality mentioned, we feel that European migration policy should strengthen co-operation and equal partnership with countries of origin and transit.  We need to work even more closely with them and that it is part of the European Commission's proposal.  It is a topic that we feel strongly about and we really hope we can push this process forward because it is a contentious issue that we need to overcome in unity and solidarity with one another.  That is very important to us.<\/p><p> On the future of Europe, like many member states, we believe that European citizens, very rightly, want to have a more vocal say.  We need to embrace that willingness to talk about the issues that are important to all of us and to our citizens.  Hopefully, we will see the start of this soon.  Most of the organisational issues, as I understand, have been cleared, although there is still an issue with the various chairpersons.  Other than that, many of the basic factors have been settled and we would like to go ahead with it.<\/p><p> As for concrete measures in Germany, I would like to revert to the committee in writing because there are a number of issues.  We have some experience with civil society dialogue formats.  We have been, and remain, very impressed with the Irish model of the citizens' assembly, so that is definitely something we will incorporate in our ideas.  We also have a cultural programme attached to our Presidency, known as Earth Speaker, which is meant to bring in young people's ideas about the future of Europe.  It is a cultural, online format where young people can express what they want from a future Europe.  It is apparently very successful.  I hope many young Irish girls and boys will join in and bring their views to the table.  It is a first, very important step to bring in young people.<\/p><p> On Europe's place in the world, I am not quite sure I completely got what the Senator was aiming at . We are very happy that we have now agreed with our European partners on the sanctions that were mentioned and that Lukashenko is now on the list.  We will follow the situation very closely and react accordingly to make very clear that we have a united stance on those issues.  In any event, the most important thing is that we work on a joint position and that there will not be deviation among member states . My Portuguese colleague, H.E. Mr. de Almeida e Sousa , mentioned a couple of other issues.<\/p><p> China, of course, is very high on the agenda and we want to broaden the consensus on a more united stance towards it too.  On 14 September, President Michel, the President of the Commission, Ms von der Leyen, and our Chancellor, spoke to President Xi in an informal video conference.  We are hoping for progress on the investment agreement side and we hope it will be possible for the EU-China leaders' meeting to take place in 2021.<\/p><p>The European Council, on 16 November, will again talk about EU-China relations, which will be an important occasion to again show that unified view.  More closely, at the moment we are very worried about the situation in the eastern Mediterranean.  Our foreign Minister was in Cyprus and Greece yesterday.  We are trying to keep a dialogue going because we feel it is of absolute importance to achieve de-escalation.  It is a very worrying situation that we hope to solve rapidly.<\/p><p> Another issue close to our hearts, and regionally close, is that we are seeking to finalise negotiation frameworks and hold a first succession conference with, hopefully, North Macedonia and, if the necessary conditions are fulfilled, also with Albania.  That is something we would like to see, and while I am not going to talk about Africa again, I would be very happy to go into more detail on that matter.<\/p><p> I turn to the view on Brexit in Germany and I am sure H.E. Mr. de Almeida e Sousa will talk about the view in Portugal.  We have said from the start, and it is a commonly shared feeling, that we greatly regret that the British are leaving.  We feel that very deeply and whole-heartedly.  We are losing a good friend, an extremely important political partner and an economic partner.  There is no doubt about that.  Obviously, Ireland&rsquo;s economic relations with the UK are closer than ours but there is no doubt it is a very important economic partner for us . That is why we need and want a close agreement and partnership with the UK.  We do not want to lose it as a friend; we want to work closely with it on political issues and do not want to lose it as an economic partner.  As we have said, however, we need to prepare for all outcomes and, unfortunately, that seems to be becoming even more urgent.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that people in Germany know about the Irish issue.  There is a great deal of information about it and, whenever anything to do with it happens, one can be sure it will be in the main newspapers.  It is a number one topic in the newspapers' online forums.  The UK Internal Market Bill, which was mentioned earlier, was front-page news because people realise how important it is.  We have said time and again that it would be very detrimental to bilateral trust and that we hope the UK will take the Bill off the table or adjust it such that it will not violate the withdrawal agreement nor break international law.  The matter is talked about a great deal back home and it is very topical in all the news there.  It has not been forgotten, although it comes with the notion that we have to look to the future and to move on.  We have to be prepared and I think we have done a good job of preparing ourselves for, as we always say, all possible outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It not only encompasses the economy.  The economy influences everything, but the countries that have a coastline must adapt.  Our oceans are changing, resources are changing and we must explore sustainability.  There must be a debate as to how we will do that, and to ensure that we preserve our fishing industry and the livelihood of fishermen.  Developments in the area of aquaculture will have an impact here and new technologies can be used to explore and define more precisely our capacities.  <\/p><p> We will also need to explore our continental shelves in a reasonable way.  The Irish, French and Spanish continental shelves are in a continuous line and the exploration of them was something we were trying to develop before Covid.  There is considerable scope for co-operation on security because it is a large area and also in the area of the reasonable and controlled access to resources. The use of wave energy is also being developed.<\/p><p> The blue economy is reality would have been part of the UN conference on oceans.  The UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, is a former Portuguese Prime Minister, and someone who was very active in the area of marine policy during his premiership.  It is sometimes forgotten, but there is a European strategy for the sea, which is being implemented without visibility.  We should try to highlight this and show that work is being done.  Developments are being made, but we should do more.  Ireland and Portugal, as coastal countries, have a special responsibility and interest in developing the blue economy.<\/p><p> The sea represents transport, fisheries and the economy.  There are many issues currently being debated such as those concerning the environment and plastic in our oceans and there is a lot of scope for us to highlight issues.  The blue economy would be a good topic for Ireland to raise at the meeting in Lisbon.<\/p><p> Regarding Belarus, I have nothing to add to the comments made by H.E. Ms Potzel.  <\/p><p> On the question raised regarding the future of Europe and the preparations made, like Germany, Portugal followed the Irish model on the debate with the citizens.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee, visited Lisbon and participated in an event.  She attended the Portuguese Parliament to discuss and present, and I was impressed by what I saw.  I suggested that the Irish model should be followed and it was.  At the conference on the future of Europe, we need to reach out, and we should ask what we can do with what we have.  We saw with the last referendum that people are growing a little tired of the rules always changing.  We have a framework and we should work on it.  If we need to change it in the future, we can, but for the time being, we should have a debate that is faithful to the objective, to reflect on our policies and gauge the feelings of the member states on what they would like Europe to be.<\/p><p>If we develop the policies as we are doing now, and that have been identified by everyone, we will reach out to our citizens, which is one of the main priorities of our Presidency.<\/p><p> Regarding Brexit, I will tell the Senator how present the issue is in Portugal.  Not a day goes by without a report on this issue.  Sometimes I have to move faster than journalists because they can report on issues quicker than I can and they do not have the same things to do that I have.  However, it is very much a current issue and it is something that people feel.  It is not a foreign problem for them.  For example, if one goes to Portugal and speaks to those working in business, rather than those in parliament, it is clear that they are very aware of the issue, and their solidarity with Ireland has not failed since the beginning of the process.  Irish and Portuguese people share similarities and are close, even if the Irish are more fair in their colouring.  The Irish and Portuguese are also similar in how they react to things, which some may find surprising.  There is also a European and Atlantic solidarity.  Brexit is, therefore, current in Portugal.  As H.E. Ms Potzel stated, we want to maintain a close relationship with the UK because it will solve many problems, but we also want a balanced one which will preserve the integrity of the Internal Market, which Ireland and the whole of Europe needs.  We are prepared to come to a solution, and a solution will be reached, but it is too early to say what form that solution will take, because what happens from week to week in London varies.  We hope the situation stabilises.  Following that, we must find concrete solutions to ensure the provisions and objectives of the protocol are applied and remain intact.  These are concerns that Ireland and the other EU member states share.<\/p><p> I reassure the Senator that Portugal has not forgotten about Brexit, and it remains a major topic.  I am always reporting on the issue.  Even when Michel Barnier sneezes, I have to report on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I express gratitude for the strong expression of solidarity with Ireland in relation to the unique difficulties that Brexit poses for us.  We recognise that there are still pressure points to come, so that solidarity is not a past issue.  We all hope that an agreement will be reached, but in the event that there is no agreement, the protocol is a settled matter and not one to be undermined.  If we repeat that message, it increases the prospect of a deal being reached.<\/p> <p>  I have read the Presidency programmes.  Presidency programmes are quite like programmes for Government in that they are extraordinarily ambitious for being programmes of just a six-month duration, but I suppose one needs a continuum.  I will ask three questions, even though, like Deputy Richmond, I could ask 1,000 questions on what H.E. Ms Potzel has said and on the programme itself.<\/p> <p>  Everything in the German Presidency programme has been overshadowed by the Covid pandemic.  I will not say it has been undermined because that is not the case, but it has been impacted by the pandemic.<\/p><p>The pandemic itself has impacted on European citizens' view of Europe.  I believe it is fair comment to say there was a certain lack of solidarity at the beginning of the pandemic.  All the cohesion of Europe seemed to be undermined in a rush to nationalism and protectionism in respect of our borders, medicine supply and acute hospital systems.  That needs to be repaired.  I am keen to hear from the ambassadors whether they believe the multi-annual financial framework of funding, the expression of solidarity and the future sharing of vaccines and medicines will rebuild that eroded sense of solidarity from the beginning of the pandemic.<\/p><p> My second question is a Brexit-related topic.  It relates to the ambition within the German Presidency for a strengthening and integration of capital markets in Europe.  Obviously, the removal of the City of London from the EU sphere will have an impact on financial services generally.  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on the developed model of how the integrated and strengthened capital markets within a European Union without the City of London is envisaged.<\/p><p> My third question relates to growing nationalism in the European Union.  It is an issue we discussed briefly in the preparation of our work programme.  The German and Portuguese commentaries both underscored the importance of strengthening fundamental European social values.  These are clearly being undermined in several European countries where the rule of law, having an independent judiciary, freedom of the press and individual human rights, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, LGBT, rights, have been significantly assaulted.  I am keen to hear the uptake of the ambassadors and, rather than simply the rhetoric of saying this is a bad thing, how it will be fundamentally addressed.  If the values of Europe are fundamentally undermined, then the European project itself is fundamentally undermined.  Is there a place in the next phase of European Union development for countries that do not subscribe to those fundamental values?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#O00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassadors.  I will not repeat some of the comments that have been made but I echo most of them, especially the comments around Brexit.  The position that has been adopted in terms of support for the Irish protocol is much appreciated.  I know we are facing a highly challenging period now.  I believe Boris Johnson has set tomorrow as the deadline.  While I do not believe that is realistic, certainly time is of the essence at this point.  The support is noted and welcome.<\/p> <p>  I want to home in on some areas around the humanitarian crisis and the migration issue.  The fire in Lesbos at Moria probably catapulted the issue to centre stage again.  There are concerns that this ultimately exposed the complete failure of Europe to address one of the major humanitarian duties facing us, as it has been described, by allowing the situation to get to that point.  I believe there has been failure by many countries.  I am keen to get a viewpoint on the responses of different countries to living up to obligations and commitments made in previous agreements, like the agreement in 2015, for example.  Only last week I cited our response in this State, especially in dealing with unaccompanied minors.  There was an agreement here to accept 35 unaccompanied minors in 2015.  To date, I understand we have only taken in nine.  I am keen to get a viewpoint on that.  Are countries living up to their commitments and obligations?  What hopes are there for a new migration agreement if previous ones have not been adhered to and if previous obligations have not been lived up to?<\/p><p>On the issue of Palestine, over the summer there was a lot of concern around the threats and moves to annex large parts of the West Bank.  Eleven EU foreign affairs ministers wrote to Europe to ask for guidance as to what measures could be taken if Israel annexed large sections of the area.  I understood they considered different measures, such as potential embargoes, trade etc.  I acknowledge that annexation <i>per se<\/i>has fallen off the agenda.  It is not receiving the same media spotlight as was the case during the summer.  That is not to say that annexation is not happening on a daily basis.  The two-state solution and a viable Palestinian state are being dismantled on a daily basis.  It is simply not being spoken about.  The D&aacute;il voted overwhelmingly a number of years ago to officially recognise the state of Palestine.  It is an issue that has been debated at European level over a number of years.  Is it now time, at European level, to recognise the state of Palestine officially?  What measures are being or will be looked at if the hopes, dreams and aspirations of people living in the state are ultimately destroyed with the annexation of up to 30% of the West Bank? <br\/><br\/> I wish to touch on the right to determination.  In October 2017, the Catalan people voted overwhelmingly to express their right to self-determination and to live in an independent Catalan state.  Since that time, parliamentarians have been imprisoned.  Recently, the Catalan President was banned from public office.  As was said, it is ultimately an attempt to destroy the Government of Catalonia.  Very little has been said about it at a European level.  The silence of the Government regarding this attack on the democratic process has been deafening.  What approach will be taken to the continued blatant disregard for the express views of the majority of the Catalan people in terms of self-determination?  What measures will be taken by the outgoing German Presidency and incoming Portuguese Presidency?<br\/><br\/>It was stated that the escalating situation in the eastern Mediterranean is deeply concerning.  Some measures have been taken to bring all parties around the table.  I note that Turkey has sent a research ship back into the waters that are of grave concern.  That may show that that side is not being serious about negotiations and coming to some sort of solution.  Greece has expressed particular concerns and vetoed a position on Belarus.  That was quite concerning.  I welcome the measures that have been adopted by Europe in terms of Belarus but similar actions and measures are not being taken in respect of other countries.  Over many years Turkey has been involved in the unlawful occupation of northern Cyprus.<\/p><p>This issue has not been dealt with by Europe.  Now we see a concerning situation in the eastern Mediterranean that has massive implications for Europe, not only in terms of destabilisation but the risk of potential conflict.  What measures are being looked at?  I know the primary objective is to get everyone around the table but that is difficult when some of the people who should be around the table are ratcheting up tensions by sending out ships.  Will the ambassador give a viewpoint on the eastern Mediterranean because it is an issue, unfortunately, that will continue to escalate until all partners get around the table?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#P00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I am happy to see Deputy Howlin in good health.  Regarding his questions, it is true that in the beginning the response given to the pandemic was very national in the sense that governments had to show their citizens that they were acting.  However, President von der Leyen has said from the very beginning the EU was working on it without visibility.  On many issues, one of the problems for the EU is that its work is not acknowledged or known but it is done.  That is one of the European problems and it is a problem of perception.  The EU has worked like a hut or covering and it has been very important on co-ordination as a result.  It has created the forum where we can exchange information.  It provided some alternatives and solutions for dealing with different aspects of the pandemic.  Now people acknowledge there is a role for the European Commission but it started before it was known.  I sat in Brussels for many years and I knew that sometimes outside the Council, we are keen to show there is a victory and we are successful when, in fact, often there is compromise so it is success for everyone and not only one member state.  Sometimes it is a problem of presentation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding future treatments and vaccines, this is a global pandemic which will have a global solution.  This will not be only inside the EU or the US.  Today we heard from several laboratories that are exploring.  They say it will be for the benefit of all humanity.  The treatment will be worldwide.  It is global because if we solve a problem on one side but not the other, it will come back.  We need a global approach and it will come.<\/p> <p>  On nationalism in the EU, it is true that we have it in several countries.  In Portugal, for example, we do not have it.  It is not known but we have an unsolved problem with Spain regarding a small corner.  The problem is still open but we do not discuss it.<\/p><p>We have a very pragmatic view that we will solve it.  This dates from the 18th century so it is has been a long time.<\/p><p> We do not have nationalism but there is an increase.  We were saying earlier that if people have a perception of the benefits of the European Union, Europe will answer to them.  That will be the best solution to fighting nationalism.  Every member state must apply the rule of law and the rules of democracy.  We have to find balanced solutions to ensure that it will do so.  I agree it is a big problem but the more successfully the European Union works, the less probability of this surge of nationalism being successful and it will diminish.<\/p><p> Regarding the protocol, it was signed by all member states so it is international law.  It was ratified so it is untouchable.  If there is no Brexit deal, we have to find solutions to ensure that what we intend to protect with the protocol will work.  In terms of how we will do that, let us take one worry at a time.<\/p><p> Regarding Israel, I served as ambassador to Israel before coming to Ireland.  One of the lessons I learned is that it is a country where nothing is obvious.  I was still in Israel when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, came to visit.  He had a very good approach regarding Israel.  Ireland, with the positions it has taken, is listened to carefully now.  The problem with the Middle East is that there are different narratives.  They fight for the same land, which is not very large.  Some kind of solution will come.  When one travels around Israel, and the officials with me may not see it, one will see that there is a consciousness that a two-state solution will come about.  It will be needed.  It is not forgotten.  I know that the values and principles of the EU are presented every day.  We have taken several measures and they made the Israeli Government reconsider some of its decisions and the statements.  It is a region where, in the end, the victory comes from the one who speaks louder but what is behind it can sometimes be completely different.  I can share with the members my experience in Israel.  The position of the EU has not changed.  It is two states for two peoples living in peace and security.  That is the position also of several countries around it.  I know it is difficult but as was said, it is full of ups and downs.<\/p><p> Regarding Catalonia, it is a Spanish internal problem.  There are constitutional mechanisms to solve it.  We hope they will be acting on those and the European Union can follow on that point.  However, it is up to the Spanish regions to resolve the issue of how they can be together.  If they decided to split, which I hope will never be the case, that will be a decision made by all of them.  The problem must be treated within the constitutional framework of Spain.<\/p><p>The problem regarding the eastern Mediterranean is serious.  Germany has an important role as mediator and the mediation is more or less working.  It is an unsolved problem, of course, that the European Union is in solidarity with the member states involved but also has a responsibility to help in some way to find a solution which cannot be imposed; it must be decided by all of them.  <\/p><p> These are problematic areas where one cannot impose a solution from the outside.  It does not work like that.  Where needed, one's role will be more efficient if one intervenes as mediator, adviser and encourager.  However, if one tries to impose on some of the Catalan cases, I know it will be counterproductive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"H.E. Mr. Miguel de Almeida e Sousa","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>That was so comprehensive that I will pick up on, perhaps, one or two things and keep it short.  Mr. de Almeida e Sousa described the impact and lack of solidarity, as the Deputy described it, within the EU regarding the pandemic.  It would be wonderful if we could change that narrative a little bit in the sense that we might be able to look at what has been achieved since.  There is no doubt mistakes were made at the beginning and that we could have done better.  On the other hand, this thing came of the blue and we did not have a blueprint in the drawers of how to go about it.  Since health policy is still a national competency, everybody was focusing on an immediate response.  As Mr. de Almeida e Sousa said and as everybody agrees, mistakes were made in that process.<br\/><br\/>We can, however, be proud of the solidarity that has been shown within the EU.  I think of the hundreds of thousands of stranded tourists we brought back together.  Everybody helped one another.  German and Portuguese tourists were on Irish planes and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We brought back Irish and Portuguese people as well.  That was helpful.  I do not want to brag about what we did but I know what Germany did.  It was appreciated that we took in patients from Italy and France when their ICUs were overloaded.  We will now hopefully get the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and recovery fund going.  We are taking that much money into our hands to help and deviate from or overcome the economic and social impacts of the pandemic.  It is also worthwhile looking at the positives achieved in that process.<br\/><br\/>I wish also to say a few words on the concern about growing nationalism in the EU, which we all agree we need to look into.  We are doing so and, as Mr. de Almeida e Sousa said, we need to talk with citizens in our societies about the importance of the values of the European Union which we all agree upon.  We need to do that.  I will allude to the fact we celebrated 30 years of German reunification on 3 October.  I was born in East Germany and I know what it feels like not to have the freedoms we all enjoy in Europe, that is, the freedoms of expression, movement and assembly and the freedom to design and pursue one's life in a space of freedom and liberty.<\/p><p>We need to talk about this more in our societies.  We must also keep reaching out to what are known as the \"bubbles\" on social media to try to break those bubbles and reach out to people who are not of the same view.  We need to keep that dialogue going to make people aware of the wonderful treasure that we have in our open, liberal and democratic societies.  That is extremely important.  There are reasons or roots for nationalism which are very different in every country and it is important for countries to look at that themselves, I suppose.  We do have ways and means, such as the Article 7 procedures against Hungary and Poland that are going on and will go on and, also, in the European context, to deal with certain aspects of the rule of law and to defend the rule of law in our member states.<\/p><p> On Palestine, we have and will continue to strongly advocate a two-state solution for Palestine and Israel.  We are in very close contact with our Israeli friends, but also with our Palestinian friends.  There is a huge amount of economic support for Palestine.  We have a close relationship to both Israeli and Palestine and with reference to the annexation plans, we have been very clear and very outspoken to our Israeli friends that we feel that that is a step in the wrong direction and that we still advocate a two-state solution.  We are very clear on that, including as a member of the EU.  Our foreign minister had a very good exchange with the Israeli foreign minister at one of the last meetings of the Council.  I cannot recall at which council but the latter attended for a lunch and the ministers had a very good exchange on all these matters.  <\/p><p> On the eastern Mediterranean, we are very much in solidarity with our Cypriot friends and our Greek friends.  We tried to reach out to Turkey and we will keep trying.  We have said that back and forth from the Turkish side in terms of agreeing to talk and then sending in another ship is not helpful.  We have said that is definitely not helping the dialogue.  We will sit together in the EU.  We have told our friends from Cyprus that we will sit together and figure out what other signals we can send to the Turkish Government to make it even more aware of where we stand on this.  We will not give up on that - definitely not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#T00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I will make two points.  The first is related to the agreement yesterday by the Council to a traffic light system to co-ordinate travel restrictions across Europe, putting in place a common mapping system to define areas at different levels of risk.  Is there broad support for this in Portugal and Germany?  Do the ambassadors think we are a little behind when it comes to Covid-19 pre-flight testing?  Is it something the Presidency may be thinking of rolling out?  We need to get our countries up and running again economically and we are going to be living with Covid for some time.  Should pre-flight testing be part of our agenda in Europe going forward?<\/p> <p>  My next point is in regard to the future of Europe, putting the citizen at the centre of that and building alliances.<\/p><p>Our guest witnesses' countries have very ambitious Presidency programmes.  How ambitious are their countries in respect of putting their citizens first?  At present, in Ireland we offer free travel to our citizens over the age of 65.  I note that this is also done in Belgium and Hungary.  Would it not be wonderful if we could build alliances to offer free travel or discounted travel to all of our elderly citizens within our European states?  Many people today when going abroad when over the age of 70 cannot even hire a car in some of these European countries because of their age.  Perhaps that might be an ambitious programme for our guests to take back as part of their Presidency of the European Council in the future.  That would be one way to put the citizens first.  Those are the two points I wished to make to our guest and I thank them for coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#U00300","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>We have had a wide-ranging discussion here this morning and have covered all of the major topics.<\/p><p>I refer to an editorial in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>dated 2 June 2020 relating to Chancellor Merkel, which stated, &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s longest-serving leader faces an Olympian test of her eye for detail, her nose for negotiation and her ear for compromise.&rdquo;  The article refers to Chancellor Merkel as &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s safest pair of hands&rdquo;.  We are fortunate to have Chancellor Merkel in the Presidency at this particularly challenging time for Europe and I refer especially to the Covid-19 problem.  Our witnesses have outlined the major concerns and issues in respect of the current Presidency and the incoming Presidency.<\/p><p>We had an unprecedented budget for unprecedented times yesterday here.  The multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the associated recovery fund are also unprecedented.  It should not be lost on anybody that Europe will borrow money to get us out of this serious economic situation.  I am hoping that by the time Portugal takes over, some of these issues will be off the agenda, that the recovery fund will be up and running and we will have an agreement or no agreement with the United Kingdom.  One way or another, Brexit is coming to a conclusion and like the other speakers, I thank both of our guests&rsquo; countries for the solidarity they have shown to the Irish situation arising from Brexit.  <\/p><p>On migration and refugee policy generally and the Commission proposal, migration is a big issue in several European states and we have referred to the rise of nationalism and of populism.  I hope the ambassador from Portugal does not mind if I ask the German ambassador a specific question.  On the domestic opinion on migration in Germany, the ambassador spoke of the need for solidarity on a European level and the need to share the burden.  Would that be a widely held view among the citizens of Germany?  Is it a general humanitarian concern or an economic concern?  We all remember the pictures on our television screens of Germany opening up its borders and the queues of refugees arriving in.  That really made an impression and brought home the whole migration situation to all of us.  I am interested to know what the domestic opinion is on this issue and why that decision was taken?  Is there a strong humanitarian concern in Germany among its citizens?  <\/p><p>Otherwise, I wish both of our guests well in their endeavours.  We had a long discussion on the rule of law and on the conference on the future of Europe.  The Irish model in the first phases of that went very well and the Irish citizens were significantly engaged with that process.  I recall that the then Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, spearheaded that process.  <\/p><p>I ask that my one specific question be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#V00300","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank both Ambassador Potzel and Ambassador de Almeida e Sousa and I also apologise now for my pronunciations.<\/p><p>An awful lot has been dealt with.  I also thank our guests for their solidarity on Brexit.  They may not feel inclined to answer the following question but I am going to ask it anyway.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to the committee last week and expressed his view that Britain needs a deal as badly as anyone else and, to a degree, we need to concentrate on ensuring a deal that will protect Europe and Ireland, and gives Britain what it needs.  That said, we must allow for a worst-case scenario.  The Internal Market Bill is now in place and we must consider the possibility of other legislation and the circumventing of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  I welcome the fact that our guests have said that they will stand with Ireland.  Could I ask for some detail on that, as far as our guests can go?  There is a need for an almost hermetical seal around the Single Market and customs union.  What happens in a doomsday Brexit situation?<\/p><p> I welcome what has been said about the improving pandemic response.  There has been mention of the traffic light system and I would also throw the testing scenario into that.  Our considerations are the future as regards the health response, which is changing all the time, and the recovery fund and what we do about that.  There has perhaps been too much of an emphasis on loans versus grants.  Down the line, we must look at something that will be more of a Marshall Plan-type scenario.  How would our guests foresee that happening?<\/p><p> Mention was made earlier about the future of Europe.  There are difficulties surrounding the multi-annual financial framework.  Our guests have spoken about moving in the direction of a social Europe.  The pandemic has taught us of the necessity of public service and governmental intervention.  Europe has been very good but, to a degree, there has been an overemphasis in latter years on private enterprise and the free flow of capital, although I do not wish to take away from those things.  We need protection for people and some of that is about the ability at European or governmental level to bring in necessary protections.  We have had to ride roughshod over certain rules at domestic and European levels to do what was necessary to respond to the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#V00500","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank the committee members for their questions.  I was asked about the broad support for the traffic light system.  It is very much in the interests of our citizens that they have clarity on how, where and when they can travel.  Much of the insecurity that we observe arises from changing targets and it is important that we have an agreement.  There is broad support within the population in Germany.  I do not have poll numbers to reflect that but I think there is broad support for this clarity that gives people something to work with.  We get asked what is going on every day at the embassy.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  I will send back the recommendation on free travel for senior citizens.  There are obviously discount measures in all countries but I will definitely send back the Senator's suggestion.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Haughey for his warm words about Chancellor Merkel.  He asked about migration and the domestic opinion in Germany.  One has to say that it is a mixed picture.  At the beginning, the Chancellor decided to keep the borders open and it is important to stress that.<\/p><p>A lot of people say the Chancellor opened the borders but she really kept them open.  She would have had to make a decision to close them but she left them open and that was definitely a humanitarian decision.  People on many points of the political spectrum supported that decision but in the aftermath we have seen that the influx of almost 1 million refugees also led to a strengthening of right-leaning parties in Germany too.  Overall however, five years on from the decision and the 2015 refugee crisis, the feeling in Germany is that it worked out well and that integration of foreigners and refugees - which we still have to improve - worked well.  I think it is reported in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that for the first time ever, the population of Germany is shrinking and we realise we do actually need immigration as a country.<br\/><br\/>As such, it is a mixed picture.  Some people would not be very much in agreement with the way the German Government handled it and they are worried about certain aspects of it but if one looks at opinion polls, the majority of people would say we did well and that we also profit from immigration.  Obviously, however, in view of the migration policy and asylum policy we are trying to put in place in European countries, we have to make efforts to deal with illegal immigration and to look into how to react to people who do not have a reason for getting asylum, for instance.  We definitely need to look at these issues.  All in all, however, I think the opinion is, as I said, pretty positive on that back home.<br\/><br\/>In a quick word on Brexit, we keep saying we expect the British Government to fully respect the obligations in the withdrawal agreement and we will keep saying that.  Obviously the protection of the Single Market is paramount and Ireland has said that time and again as well.  I think we are all in the same boat on this.  The Chancellor has also said more than once that it is not an Irish problem but a European one.As such we will keep telling the Brits to stick to the withdrawal agreement and of course the Northern Ireland protocol.  If we do not succeed in getting a deal and it ends up in a no-deal scenario, we will still keep pushing them to implement what they have signed up for.  That is as much as I can say on that at the moment.<br\/><br\/>On protection of citizens, if I got that question correctly, looking at the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and especially the recovery fund, I think most of the targets there are aimed at helping our citizens to get through this pandemic and to overcome the repercussions due to the pandemic.  While it might not always be spelled out, it is definitely there.  In addition, one of our priorities that I have not mentioned yet was a social Europe and the protection of our citizens, our youngsters and youth, which is very important.  We feel that also requires a strong, co-ordinated European response but that is definitely also something we want.  We want to strengthen the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, for instance, within the EU framework for national minimum wages or minimum security schemes.  We intend to evaluate the proposal for a European unemployment reinsurance scheme.  It was announced by the European Commission and is very important to us.<\/p><p>We are also committed to strengthening the Youth Guarantee and tackling youth unemployment.

This is very important as we try to pave a way forward.<\/p> <p>  We are also conscious of the multi-annual financial framework and the funding for it from 2021 to 2027.  Whatever work comes out of digitisation there are also questions within it on how we engage with citizens.  Physical interaction varies between limited and non-existent.  How do we put the European citizen at the centre of these deliberations and conversations?  Senator Keogan used a practical example.  We still have opportunities to do this.  While people cannot meet and limited interaction is the conversation of the day, with digitisation people can still communicate.<\/p><p>The witnesses have emphasised a stronger and more innovative Europe.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the principle of subsidiarity, which has been flying around Europe for a number of decades, we are in that space now.  We can work according to the principle of subsidiarity in that we can hear the voices of people in very rural and marginalised, peripheral areas because of digital opportunities but we need to back up our capacity and build resilience.  All of us in this room have examples from our constituencies and countries of communities that are considering more innovative approaches.  In my parish, Carrigart, we are building a digital hub.  Towns such as Rathmullan in my county are looking at smart villages.  There is an example of funding for smart villages throughout Europe but I believe we can build on the capacity a little more.  I will have information on that.  I do not require a response today but I can forward the information.<br\/><br\/>An old Irish saying I came across in Connemara a couple of years ago is, &quot;Castar na daoine ar a ch&eacute;ile ach n&iacute; chastar na cnoic n&aacute; na sl&eacute;ibhte.&quot;  &quot;The people meet but the hills and the mountains do not.&quot;  At present, we face an unbelievable dilemma: not alone do the hills and mountains not meet but the people do not meet either.  Therefore, we have to work so much harder at connecting people.  It is a matter of building resilience and connections.  Ambassador Potzel, <i>danke<\/i>.

Ciara Mellett is the new head of Healthy Ireland, which is a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Caroline Pigott is our head of resources in the Sl&aacute;intecare office and Grainne Healy is our head of citizen engagement.  If the members have any particular questions on those areas they can address them to those colleagues.<\/p> <p>  As most of the members know, the Sl&aacute;intecare report emanated from the all-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It is a ten-year healthcare reform.  We translated that into an implementation strategy, an action plan and, this year, a joint action programme.  We are taking a programmatic approach to the implementation of this vast and exciting programme.<\/p> <p>  The key principles are delivering the right care in the right place at the right time and given by the right team; promoting health and well-being and preventing illness; bringing the majority of care into the community; creating an integrated system of care that is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay; and moving from long waiting times to a timely service, with accountability and performance at the heart of it.  Fundamentally, it is about trying to deliver a health service that has the capability and capacity to manage changing needs.  This will be done through a population-based planning approach with clear pathways between GPs, community and social care services and hospitals and empowerment of front-line staff, with one budget per region.  It was a decision by Government last year that we would be moving to this regional implementation.  Fundamentally, it is about many parts of the system working together in terms of community healthcare workers, occupational health, dental services, GPs etc. and all of the HSE colleagues across the system.<\/p> <p>  We are in year two of implementation.  Our job in the implementation office, which is based in the Department of Health, is to ensure that all parts of the system are following the strategy, to work collaboratively and to report on progress.  This year, it is also about learning the lessons from Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  I will not go through them but we have a variety of implementation work streams.  It is a vast programme with many moving cogs that all need to work together, and there is a strategy behind that.  Fundamental to it, and it was very much addressed in the budget, is the capacity and access programme, which is about making sure we have enough access so that people can hit the Sl&aacute;intecare target waiting times for inpatient, outpatient, diagnostics, emergency department, ED, and community care and that we have enough human and infrastructural capacity after reforms in line with the health capacity review.  These are divided into three big pillars.  One is about healthy living, which is our Healthy Ireland programme.  Another is about enhanced community care, which I will talk about, and the other is about hospital productivity improvements.<\/p> <p>  Regarding progress to date on healthy living, we have our Healthy Ireland strategy, which rolls out the obesity policy, physical health and sexual health strategies and a focus on prevention and citizen engagement.  We have many initiatives with partners across the country to roll that out, including with Healthy Cities and Counties, the Healthy Ireland charter network, the warmth and well-being scheme and the Making Every Contact Count initiative through GPs.  <\/p> <p>  Interestingly, in the budget for next year we have a new area-based health and well-being initiative in disadvantaged areas with a ring-fenced additional &euro;20 million for Healthy Ireland this year, which we very much welcome.<\/p> <p>  In terms of enhanced community care, the focus is on rolling out community healthcare networks with a basis of population for 50,000 in a group.  There will be 96 of those across the country,with chronic disease and older persons specialist hubs, integrated care, GPs, community and hospitals.  This will be enabled through healthcare pathways, and I would be very interested in elaborating on that if we get the opportunity to do so.  The approach is to help these mini-communities of approximately 50,000 across the country.<\/p><p>The impact of this community care initiative will be to move patients with ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions from hospitals into the community.  The funding in yesterday's budget and through last year is very welcome and will mean these 96 area-based services can be rolled out and we can start to give the care in the community that is absolutely needed.  The provision will be based around the older persons and chronic disease service model, moving between the hospital, community and GPs and making sure we can treat people and keep them living well at home as long as possible.<\/p><p> Throughout this year we have had some very interesting innovation funds, with 122 different projects all around the country represented by the little red dots members can see on the screen.  These projects are about encouraging innovation, shifting care to the community and scaling and sharing examples of best practice and processes for chronic disease management.  There are some lovely examples of this happening throughout the country and fantastic learnings coming through from these projects, which will be scaled into next year.  I have set out the details of the different projects in my opening statement but I will not go through them now.  Fundamentally, they are about providing services for people and making sure they get the right care in the right place.<\/p><p> In terms of hospital productivity, we are looking at streamlining ways of working.  There have been great innovations such as the ambulance service's hear and treat initiative, pathways to treat people outside of hospital, virtual clinics and trauma centres and hospital avoidance measures.  An example is the virtual clinics for heart failure which have moved outpatient department treatment into the community.  This has meant fewer people going to hospital, with 90% of treatment now being delivered in the community.  We are making great progress on our elective hospitals development project and hope to have a business case ready before the end of the year.  The oversight group is being chaired by Professor Frank Keane.<\/p><p> Regarding the implementation status, we have had, through 2020, a quarter of the funding needed for community services.  That allocation is massively augmented in the budget for 2021.  Our e-health priorities are agreed and capital funded, we have a business case for elective hospitals and there are innovative care re-design initiatives addressing waiting lists.  We were very pleased that the programme for Government reaffirmed the commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare and we are very grateful for the support of this committee in keeping an all-party focus on its implementation.<\/p><p> I do not have time to go through the many learnings from Covid.  Many things were fast-tracked during the pandemic, particularly e-health and new ways of working.  People showed they could adapt and were up for a change and looking for new ways of doing things.  We see this in the use of e-health video consultations, the deployment of the individual health identifier, the attend anywhere booking system and Healthlink, which gathers information back to GPs.  We have a superb programme of e-health initiatives which is now fully funded in the budget and we will be able to implement it with speed over the next two years.  Huge progress was made on the individual health identifier initiative this year.  Everybody in the country now has an identifier and we are moving towards a shared care record in the coming years.<\/p><p> Our priorities for 2020 to 2023 are, first, to keep people well at home or near home, out of hospital and living independent lives.  That will be worked on through a series of initiatives which I do not have time to go through today but are based around health pathways, enhanced community funding, scaling integration funds and implementing related projects.  Our second priority is to achieve the waiting list targets through implementing the capacity and access programme, devising a multi-annual waiting list plan and commissioning the ambulatory elective centres.  The third priority is around standing back and looking at things from the perspective of a citizen care master plan, working towards universal eligibility and multi-annual funding.<\/p><p> The budget has provided a huge investment in Sl&aacute;intecare, amounting to approximately &euro;1.34 billion.  It will provide permanent funding for initiatives that have sometimes only had part-time funding.  It is a really welcome initiative.  The challenges and implementation risks for our implementation office are around ensuring there is a co-ordination of effort moving in the direction in which Sl&aacute;intecare was set by the Oireachtas committee.  The recruitment at scale is going to be a big issue.  A huge investment in people is required in terms of getting the right personnel in place.  The ongoing Covid impact on non-Covid services is something we all must live with and adapt to over time.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss these matters with the committee.  I am very happy to continue the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#A01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Magahy.

In recent months, the HSE has focused on restoring those services as far as possible, which involves delivering care in very different ways and in different settings and maximising opportunities fro technology.<\/p> <p>  Many of the service changes made this year in the context of Covid-19 align fully with the vision and direction of travel set out in Sl&aacute;intecare but there remains much to do if we are to effect the complete transformation of healthcare services in Ireland that is required.  The OECD's recent country profile for 2019 noted that, in comparison with other countries, Ireland has made good progress on life expectancy but some members of our community still experience worse outcomes than others.  We consume too much alcohol and do not maintain healthy weights.  Access to services is an issue and we have a lower proportion per head of population of practising doctors than elsewhere.  We must seek to achieve better outcomes for everybody, recognising that where we are falling behind, we need to address that and focusing our efforts on reversing those trends and accelerating the digitisation of our health service.<\/p> <p>  A key principle of Sl&aacute;intecare, as Ms Magahy outlined, is the right of patients to timely access to all healthcare and social care services according to clinical need.  In addition to the recent impact of Covid-19, there were already increasing pressures for a number of years on our scheduled and unscheduled care services as a result of population growth, increasing instances of chronic disease and an aging population.  As well as needing the right people and the right infrastructure, including buildings, equipment and technology, to deliver the right services, we need to recalibrate and remodel how we deliver those services.  Consistent with Sl&aacute;intecare, we are seeking to shift the delivery of care from the hospital setting to community settings, with a greater emphasis on prevention and supporting the population to remain healthy and well.  Our aim is to sustainably address long waiting times for scheduled care services and in emergency departments, rather than just putting in short-term fixes, particularly for older people and those with more complex needs.  In that context, it is crucial that we reduce bed occupancy levels in hospitals and reduce our reliance on community residential models of care by expanding our primary and community care services.  We must enable our aging population to maintain their independence and live in the community by delivering care as close as possible to patients' homes.<\/p> <p>  While we anticipate that the continued management of Covid-19 and the restarting and delivery of core services will be a primary focus for us over the next 12 to 18 months, the wider transformation of services for the long term must occur in parallel in order to ensure we emerge stronger from the pandemic and build on the positive changes we have seen within the service in the past year.  The implementation of the recommendations of the 2018 health service capacity review has been agreed by both the Department and the HSE as a starting point for developing our capacity across community and acute services, while also reducing bed demand and improving the health of the population.  The capacity review identifies the need for significant increases in capacity across a range of community and acute services.  Consistent with that, we have made investments in a range of community and acute services, including additional home support hours and enhanced home support packages.  As Ms Magahy said, progress on the community health networks and community specialist teams will very much accelerate in the next year.  There will be a focus on ramping up the availability of diagnostics to GPs in the community and other settings and increasing the number of community, step-down and acute beds.  The very welcome investment in yesterday's budget for the health service will allow further significant increases in capacity during 2021.<\/p> <p>  Working closely with Ms Magahy and other departmental colleagues, the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare will continue to feature very prominently in the work of the HSE in all our planning processes and also in our operational decision making.  It is clear that we will be living with Covid-19 and its impacts for some time to come.  Our experience in recent months demonstrates that we are capable of driving positive change and innovating in response to unprecedented challenges.  We are living in extraordinary times where, despite the challenges the pandemic presents, there are nonetheless huge opportunities for us to make real changes happen for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

They have provided us with a lot of information on what is a very important area.<\/p><p>We had a presentation last week from mental health groups, specifically Mental Health Ireland and Jigsaw.  The representatives spoke about the percentage of the budget going to mental health and we also heard about the percentage going to GP and primary care services.  Everybody's percentage cannot increase because, otherwise, that for some area of the health sector would have to drop.  Where are we out of step, comparatively, with our EU counterparts in the context of health spending and how can it be reprofiled?<\/p><p> There was mention of community healthcare networks.  How do these compare with the primary care settings?  I presume they would be part of that.  We have seen the rolling out of many impressive buildings and there is always a question regarding buy-in from GPs.  We have the infrastructure in many parts but not the buy-in from GPs.<\/p><p> There are areas in my county and close to Galway city, for example, that would not be covered by Westdoc.  This can have an impact on recruitment of GPs.  The system could break down if the recruitment is not there.  If we are looking to invest, should we start by ensuring that there is adequate cover for Westdoc and other regional services?<\/p><p> I am interested in the issue of chronic illness.  Heart failure in a community setting is very often overlooked, especially in comparison with cancer, but it is responsible for one in every two hospital admissions relating to people over 65.  This is heart failure as opposed to heart attacks, although the difference may not be understood by everybody in the country.  Do community voluntary charity organisations feature to the fullest extent in all of this?  For example, Cro&iacute; in the west of Ireland undertakes really excellent work with people on a holistic approach to health.  Could more be done in this regard?<\/p><p> Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned the long waits for scheduled care services and accident and emergency departments.  We will speak at some stage about capital plans.  There are areas with new accident and emergency departments, such as Limerick and Kilkenny, while areas like Galway, based on the current timeline, could be four or five years waiting for a new accident and emergency department to open.  Will these infrastructural deficits have an impact on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Is the timeline too long and will this have an impact?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and will take his questions in order.  The reprofiling of health spending is very interesting.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has just finished a benchmarking exercise in respect of where Ireland sits in the international context.  It was quite difficult to do because we include disabilities, mental health and other definitions in our spending, whereas other jurisdictions do not.<\/p> <p>  I take the Senator's point on mental health and I am very happy to say we advanced significant funding to Jigsaw during the pandemic.  Jigsaw is represented on our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation advisory council.  We are very aware of the work it is doing.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about community healthcare networks and how they link with primary care settings.  The community healthcare networks are really interesting from a population planning perspective.  They will be able to predict the needs of a population of an average of 50,000 people and adjust the services needed for the population.  The primary care centre's role is critical in that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about GP buy-in.  We have a very engaged working arrangement with GPs and we meet every three weeks.  We have agreed a programme of work with them that also includes looking at future strategies for GPs, especially in the terms of the topics raised by the Senator, including recruitment in a rural setting.  That is a major issue for GPs.  We have also agreed to fund the benchmarking and monitoring of the chronic disease management that GPs will be doing.  They have kindly agreed to work in close partnership with us in healthcare pathways, which is a very interesting system.  I will ask Ms Mellett to elaborate on that if we have time.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about relief for GPs in the context of Westdoc.  We have a very interesting initiative happening this year with advance triage and this is being funded by the National Ambulance Service.  If people are anxious during the night they can phone up and be directed either to a service that is local or in a hospital, with the goal being to have this staffed by GPs.  We look forward to working with the ambulance service in rolling that out, as it is a very exciting initiative.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Cro&iacute;, which we have funded.  The work it has done on heart failure is one of the projects we have been delighted to fund.  The Senator is absolutely right that this is fantastic work.  It is something we will look at in terms of scaling.  The example I gave during the presentation was a remote heart failure clinic that is being run by Kilkenny and St. Vincent's hospitals.  There are slots available for GPs to phone in and get a senior consultant's advice on whether a patient is doing well.  It is a case of not bringing in people as an outpatient but having the expertise available on tap.  The new ways of working we have been able to explore during the year are exactly what the Senator inquired about.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Healy to speak about community and voluntary organisations, which are a key part of our engagement.  We have been very fortunate to have the support of the community and voluntary sector in the work we are advocating.  Is it possible for my colleagues to speak about health pathways and the community and voluntary piece?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Yes, although the difficulty is that we are working in slots of ten minutes.

These are a means of documenting the current approach to a particular condition, set of symptoms or patient cohort.  They are agreed by relevant health professionals and adopted to local circumstances.  The initial focus for implementation is around the interface across primary care, community care and social care with the acute sector.<\/p> <p>  With regard to benefits, this is really about building integration between primary care and secondary care.  It allows clinicians to drive service improvements.  In countries where a similar approach has been implemented, they have found that not only does it help to identify the current approach but it also helps to identify gaps where services could be improved so people can work together.  It allows a greater level of standardised care.  This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it is quite the opposite.  A minimum standard is agreed on the basis of the resources available in each region or area.  That results in a reduced variability of care, providing a better patient experience through more timely and consistent care.<\/p> <p>  The key purpose is to support GPs and others providing care in the community in order to provide more care away from the hospital setting.  It gives information to GPs in order to support them in making more decisions when the patient is sitting in front of them in the general practice.  I will not go into too much detail but I should say GPs are very strongly in favour of this approach and we are working with a broad range of stakeholders to try to implement this approach with our colleagues in the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Mellett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The involvement of the community team in the voluntary sector is very significant for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare right across the board.

Cro&iacute; was a good example.   We have also been working with local mental health services and vulnerable groups that have their own representation, such as LGBT Ireland which works with LGBT people and the needs they have.  Such organisations may offer care for older people or those with particular vulnerabilities.  Having partnerships between medical professionals and voluntary groups is very important.  It is particularly important to move towards the delivery of care as close to home as possible and in the community in order to reduce the footfall into acute settings.  We have found that many people prefer to be cared for at home or with their local community supporting them.  It is an important delivery.  Many of the 102 projects involve really interesting new pathways for care that are delivering the right care in the right place for those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I do not have much time, so I will be brief.  To build on what the previous speakers said around networks and so on, as well as to reassure members regarding general practitioner, GP, buy-in and so on, there were extensive discussions with GPs and other staff groups as part of the 2019 agreement to secure their buy-in through the relevant unions. The discussions involved taking that agreement forward and the development of the networks.  As my colleagues have stated, voluntary groups are an integral part of the local network arrangement.  The whole point of what we are trying to get towards with populations of 50,000 is that we can do things more locally and join things up in a much more straightforward manner than one can nationally or regionally.  This initiative is very positive in that space.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about infrastructure and whether it is limiting step in this context.  Obviously, there will always be more demands for capital and resources in general than there are resources available, but I assure members that we have robust prioritisation processes in place to ensure that all the capital resources we have are directed to maximum value, such as investing in additional equipment or new buildings or tidying up existing buildings and so on.  There is a process to address issues that arise.  The Senator mentioned the issue of front door capacity.  For a combination of reasons, that issue would receive a high rating in any prioritisation process.  It would be daft for us, given the budget outcome yesterday around some of the revenue funding and so on, to have everything lined up in terms of an ability to put additional capacity on the ground but then find that we did not have the kit for staff to use or a safe, modern and appropriate building for them to work in.  We work very hard to ensure the revenue and capital sides of the house are very closely aligned.  One of the reasons the service planning process we will conclude in the coming weeks is being taken forward in parallel with the capital planning process is to ensure the two join up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank Ms Magahy and Mr. Sullivan for their opening statements.

At this time, it is inevitable that there will be an impact in terms of the timeline for bringing in the Sl&aacute;intecare targets.

Regarding Sl&aacute;intecare and the organic nature of it - this question is for Ms Magahy - 50 or 60 years ago we had an institutional setting, particularly for matters such as mental health, if that is not a misnomer.  Then the emphasis was to move it - it continues to be to move it - into the community.  However, Deputies and Senators, as constituency representatives, have known that there was significant pressure on the provision of community care in the home and in other community settings.  What has been learned with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare?  For example, if this is not the only pandemic we ever experience in our lifetimes, what has the team learned about trying to deliver continuous care to people in their homes in a safe way?  How much is the inability to deliver it safely due to the provision of items such as adequate PPE?  Specifically, things like respite care would be a priority for a small number of parents in the constituency as they are under so much pressure.  The numbers relating to the provision of respite care are significantly reduced, which means the parents of adult children or children with special needs are the ones who have probably carried the greatest burden outside of front-line staff during the pandemic due to their inability to access this.  What stops them accessing it?  It seems that the provision of proper PPE would be one part of it.<\/p> <p>  There are two parts to that question.  It is my last question in this five minutes so the witnesses have time to respond to it.  What lessons have there been regarding the provision of community health, be it is people's homes or in other community settings?  What is stopping the provision of proper respite and other community care in facilities funded by the HSE but perhaps run by other organisations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#E01800","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I will start and then ask Dean Sullivan to contribute on operational questions.

When services were being delivered in a different way, such as physiotherapy, we have learned from some of our integration funds that people who were able to respond to a programme of activity online were helped by it, although it did not suit everybody.  As people began to learn to live with the disease, it became possible for people to visit other people in the home.  That does not counteract the social side and it does not counteract children missing going to school, meeting their comrades and the rhythm of every day.  If the thinking is that this will go on for much longer, the model of care for people with disabilities needs to be thought about.  This also applies to older people who would be used to going to day service settings, people with Alzheimer's disease and those caring for people with Alzheimer's disease, etc.  It is a significant burden for people who are caring for loved ones.

I think Deputy Durkan and I are the only two who were on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which addressed Sl&aacute;intecare.  I cast my mind back to those cross-party deliberations over an 11 month period with 14 Deputies.  The issue that came up most frequently during those deliberations was the fact that the organisation of the HSE is disjointed and incoherent.  At a time when we are supposed to have integrated care and integrated budgets, the HSE had seven hospital groups, nine community health organisations and God knows how many mental health teams and other structures.  There was no coherence whatsoever.  Members unanimously, as well as the vast majority of people who came in to give evidence, identified this as a key problem in how we deliver services.  There are hospitals doing one thing and community services doing another, and never the twain shall meet.<\/p> <p>  There was a strong recommendation from that committee that we needed to co-ordinate all of that and restructure it with a regional structure so that we would have a number of regional organisations, perhaps six, that would include hospitals, community and all other health and social care services.  There would be a single budget for each of those regions and a single management structure so that decisions could be taken on the spending of money in the best place.  If it was more economical and effective to spend money on community services rather than expensive hospital services, then that money could be redirected, and there would be coherence and value for money.  That was taken up, it was in the final report and it was accepted by Government, but I gather it has now been put on hold.  That is really disappointing because that was a key recommendation.  Unless we get that kind of coherence about the structure, the budget and the management accountability for the delivery of services and the spending of money on a regional basis, we are just going to continue with the HSE being amorphous, with nobody knowing who is in charge or where accountability lies.  Is it the case that that has been put on hold and, if so, why?  When are we likely to get back to implementing that key Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to elective hospitals and Ms Magahy has responded to this to some extent.  In the witnesses' consideration of that, are they considering the potential purchase of a private hospital, as happened in Edinburgh, to kickstart the shift to elective-only hospitals?  I know the witnesses are in touch with Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital.  There is plenty of space there and potential to develop it as an elective orthopaedic hospital.  Is that on the cards?<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the two key objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One was to shift activity away from hospitals to the community so there would be better health outcomes and value for money.  The other was to remove cost as an obstacle to people accessing care, because we are the only country in Europe where people have to pay the full amount to see a general practitioner, physiotherapist or such.  Is there any funding in yesterday's budget to remove cost?  It seems to have slipped down the agenda.  We have not heard anything about better, cheaper access to GP care, community care or medicines.  Can we expect anything out of the budget in that regard?  Affordability is an important element of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#F00500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was about the regions.

It is in the programme for Government.  The reality of what has happened is that we had a joint working group which Mr. Sullivan and I co-chaired.  We had worked out a high level programmatic approach for the implementation, which was concluded in February of this year, then Covid hit.  It was put on ice at that time and needs to be reconsidered in consultation with the HSE, its board and chief executive, and with the Department.  It is in the programme for Government and we consider it as a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  There was a Government decision on the geography of the regions and a commitment to come back with a business case that clearly outlines the rationale, costs and risks in ruling out these regions.

The more detailed announcement on the details of health spending was at noon today, so we are all missing that now.  Regarding GPs, there will be access to 136,000 additional diagnostic tests in 2021 and the medical card eligibility will be extended to those aged over 70 years, with 56,000 people benefiting from that measure.  From November 2020, there will be a reduction in prescription charges for those aged over 70 by 50 cent to &euro;1 per item, and by 50 cent to &euro;1.50 per item for those aged under 70.  That will benefit about 1.5 million people who have medical card eligibility.

We are not there fully, but we are getting there in respect of costs being removed as a barrier.  What is really important for the next stage, within the context of community healthcare networks, is that we will be able to plan and look at how people move between hospitals and the community.  The eligibility roadmap must be looked at in that context.  There are some oddities in that regard, for example, someone with a medical card will be entitled to services in primary care, whereas people without a medical card might be referred to an outpatient waiting list.  We need to streamline existing eligibility and ensure the kinks are ironed out of that system.

It is not always possible, therefore, to see what the total journey of care is for people who move between the settings.  There are, however, very robust systems within the HSE.  That is particularly the case regarding activity-based funding in the hospitals, but it is less robust in community settings at the moment.  That is something the e-health programme is designed to address in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#G02000","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Building on what Ms Magahy said, securing value for money with the significant resources given to the HSE each year is a key priority for the organisation.

One of the things that struck me from the briefing note was in respect of the national clinical lead for trauma services.  In 2019, work was done in that area and staff were appointed.  Particular work was done in Dublin hospitals regarding their submission to become trauma centres.  An implementation group was also set up to oversee that.  With the proviso that the ambulance service and how it operates is always a hot topic in Dublin, can the committee get a progress update on the work being done in Dublin hospitals?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that there is a huge amount of work involved in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is not only about the move to primary care but also the treatment of chronic illnesses in the long term for citizens.  The latter is a major concern and has a massive impact on people's quality of life.  An issue that has been raised with me by a few groups, and by the Asthma Society of Ireland in particular, is the creation of registers.  The Asthma Society of Ireland has reported that some of its members who attend medical services encounter difficulties in being recognised as having the condition they have.  This is also relevant in the context of people with diabetes and epilepsy.  There do not seem to be programmes for registers in Ireland, although they are quite prevalent in other EU countries, even those that operate under the constraints of GDPR, which I am sure is a concern when it comes to data collection.  I would like to understand if the creation of such registers has been considered.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we have talked about capital funding today.  This is a very important issue and I hope that the budget which has just been announced will help in that area.  We have talked a great deal about elective procedures and the possibility of accessing capacity in private hospitals.  My question concerns the community care side and relates to a much smaller-scale aspect of capital funding, particularly in the context of disadvantaged communities.  I refer to the Healthy Ireland programmes and those lifestyle and well-being benefit programmes that are listed in the briefing note.  I would like to understand what the decision-making process is regarding capital funding as it relates to those programmes.  Are we trying to find bricks-and-mortar facilities to house those important community programmes that relate to illness prevention and, if so, where are we with that work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#H00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Mr. Sullivan can perhaps answer the question relating to the work done in trauma because he has been very involved with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am happy to answer that.

That is good, because the work can now progress with some money behind it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the creation of registers.  I am pleased to say that one of the innovation projects that we have funded is to create a register for diabetes, which we have not had before.  It is being compiled at the moment.  In the context of registers for other conditions, it is interesting that the Deputy referenced the Asthma Society of Ireland because it is represented on the Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council.  In discussion with the Asthma Society of Ireland and others, it is recognised that sometimes people have many chronic illnesses.  For example, they may not just have asthma but also heart failure issues or diabetes.  I am told that the difficulty in creating individual registers is the issue of people being on multiple registers.  With the roll-out of the individual health identifier, however, that can be streamlined.  There will not be a need for individual registers for individual conditions; there will be an individual health identifier, so the condition can be linked to the person, which is better than just having a register.  With the agreement with the GPs and in the context of their management of chronic disease, which is paid for, we will be beginning the data collection process with them. The opportunity to roll out this chronic disease register is part of that work and has already been agreed.<\/p> <p>  The issue of Healthy Ireland is interesting because it is clearly operating, physically, through primary care centres through the Making Every Contact Count initiative.  However, it is also operating at a wider level through local authorities.  Almost every local authority now has a Healthy Ireland co-ordinator and plan.  As recently as yesterday we were talking with the local authorities about a resilience campaign relating to mental and physical health, which will be coming on stream before the end of the year.  In the context of the area-based disadvantage approach to Healthy Ireland whereby certain people are particularly disadvantaged, there is specific funding in place for a very exciting programme that can be implemented and rolled out next year.<\/p><p>There are now 135 primary care centres operational around the country.  Many of them are top of the range, new infrastructure and will house the more than 2,000 primary care staff who will be recruited next year.

In terms of prevention it is about keeping people well in the community through primary care centres and GPs and avoiding hospital through chronic disease management in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions in what is a very difficult time for everybody.

I acknowledge that the question is quite broad.  It is my understanding that Sl&aacute;intecare aims to achieve universal healthcare and to dismantle the two-tier healthcare system we have currently.

There is an absolute commitment to a universal health system and to separating public and private care.  The objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is to build and reinforce the public infrastructure, including staffing levels, and that is where the majority of today's funding is going.  Sl&aacute;intecare does not say, interestingly, that there should be no private care but that there should be a separation of public from private.  In looking at how that would take place, the de Buitl&eacute;ir report last year recommended a series of steps.  Critical to implementation is a new public-only consultant contract which will come into play from January next year.  In public hospitals consultants can only provide public care and no private work will be permitted.  That will separate the public and the private and make the differentiation between the systems much clearer.  If a patient is in the public system, he or she will get care in public hospitals by publicly funded staff.  That is a very important initiative.  There are 300 consultant posts funded at &euro;250,000 each in the budget that was announced yesterday and they will be rolling out next year.<\/p> <p>  There will always be some resistance to reform but what we have seen is that people are very willing to come on board with the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare.  They were obviously very well considered when they were written because they are things to which people can sign up and the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are understood by everybody.  The delivery of them will be nuanced, depending on people's perspective.  We have certainly found, and Covid has demonstrated in spades, that when people see the bigger picture and see where they fit within it, they are willing to go with it and are pleased to do so.  They like that leadership and vision.  I would say that has held and that the budget, to be honest, is a lever of change.

It is also very clear about the expectation of and need for universal access to healthcare that is free at the point of use.  It is also very clear about the direction of travel in terms of delivering care as close as possible to the patient's home and about trying to support people to live healthy lives at home as independently as possible.  There is nothing in there that any of us here or among the population at large could argue with but the challenge is giving life to that.  We have made reasonable progress over the first couple of years, as Ms Magahy has described, and I hope that progress really accelerates in the next 12 to 18 months.

I have one question with two parts.  Like Deputy Kenny's question, I am dealing with high-level or blue sky thinking.  Obviously Covid-19 has had an impact on every part of our lives but particularly in the health sector.  The witnesses have already alluded to this but how will the Covid-19 crisis affect the Sl&aacute;intecare plan?  Ms Magahy said that she wants to see this done in a couple of years but we do not have an endpoint for the realisation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  When the National Health Service was set up, people in Britain were told it would be done by a certain date and that was the end of it.  When one does not have an endpoint, it is a little bit easier to extend and move things around.  What impact will Covid-19 have on our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plans?  Is that a bit like asking how long is a piece of string?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in two issues in particular, one of which is weariness among those working in the sector and the other is change management.  A key element of this is buy-in from those who are going to be rolling it out.  Weariness and burnout are pervasive and get into people's core.  This is an issue for healthcare workers most of the time but Covid-19 has exacerbated it.  Is the office engaging in strategic planning on how to deal with weariness and burnout in the sector?  If the people rolling out the programme are not able to do it because they are exhausted, that will knock Sl&aacute;intecare on the head.  Is there long-term planning around the knock-on effects of Covid-19?  Those effects will be society wide and include issues with people's physical and mental health, undiagnosed illnesses as well as delayed diagnoses.  We have a shocked system and a shocked population.  We do not yet know what the long-term implications will be but we know that people are missing out on diagnoses and so forth.<\/p><p>How does Ms Magahy see that impacting upon those timelines?

The Senator is correct, in that even when Sl&aacute;intecare is done, it will require continuous improvement on an ongoing basis because nothing is ever finished.  If we can manage to put in place the structures, systems, staffing, training and e-health, then the architecture of Sl&aacute;intecare will be complete and it can continue iterating and improving thereafter.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct to say that there must be burnout in the system after Covid-19.  It has been an incredible onslaught for people working in the system, both those working on the front line and those managing the pandemic.  Colleagues in the HSE and the Department have been at the forefront of this in recent months and have been working unbelievable hours to try to deal with something they had not expected and do not fully understand, as nobody does.  They have shown incredible resilience in doing so.  I must say that people need hope that a better system is coming, that it is funded, that there is a plan for it and that they can see that things will get better.  An indication of the need to fund that is that there is money in the budget for well-being for staff, and a particular programme of activity will be implemented in this area by the HSE.  Therefore, there is recognition that there is an issue in terms of burnout and people being worried, as well as a programme being implemented in that respect.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also raised the issue of the wider societal impact of Covid-19, and the unknowns that exist.  Some very good planning has been done through the clinical care programmes within the HSE and the Department in trying to anticipate and put in place specialist hubs in the community for people who have been impacted by Covid-19, particularly in the areas of respiratory and mental health.  This will entail putting place more mental health supports for young people, older people and the staff of the health services and systems.  Therefore, a good bit of anticipatory work has been done and has been factored into the community healthcare planning.  When we started, we talked about community healthcare networks linking with primary care teams and specialist hubs for older people but now, there are also specialist hubs that will be focusing on the downstream effects of Covid.  We do not know what will happen until we have a vaccine and things get better next year at some point, but people need hope that the system is going to change and that they will be a part of that.

If one takes Cork as an example, a number of sites are clearly suitable for the development of a new elective hospital, one being in Sarsfield Court, which has more than 100 acres and is owned by the HSE.  My understanding from Ms Magahy's comments this morning is that while a proposal will be made to the Government by the end of the year, that proposal will not identify the preferred site of development.  I am confused about timelines in this regard because if the plan does not identify the site, we will spend another six to 12 months identifying a site, another two years trying to get planning permission and a further three years building the hospital.  I am confused that although there is an area in which no new hospital bed has been provided in the past 30 years and which has experienced a huge growth in population, we seem to be pushing paper around without any clear answers.  Four weeks ago, I asked the Minister for an update in writing.  What Ms Magahy has presented to us today is not in writing.

An analysis has been carried out by the HSE of its budget.  The barrier to full-time recruitment is the knowledge that ongoing funding would be required for the posts.  Going back to the detail of today's budget, there is a commitment to many thousands of ongoing posts on a permanent basis, which should obviate the need for agency staff in a significant way.  It is good news that we are now able to recruit more permanent staff and to invest in the public system.<\/p> <p>  When we hear about beds being funded, we are talking about the staff.  It is the staff who are being funded, not the beds.  The beds come from the capital plan.  The issue is the staffing of those beds.  As we are aware, in intensive care units, ICUs, a five-time ratio is needed in order to provide full-time care for a patient.  That is a massive investment in nursing staff and in other healthcare professionals in hospitals and in the community.  Whether it is community beds, hospital beds, ICU beds, residential beds or neurorehabilitation beds, the big cost is not the beds, it is the staff.  What is in the budget today will allow us to plan on a multi-year basis and not just fund things on a temporary basis.  Traditionally, when we fund services for winter, which is a bizarre concept anyway, we have been turning services on and then turning them off.  One cannot hire people on that basis because they cannot commit and hospitals cannot commit to the training and the ongoing service.  When full-time funding is given for these positions it will reduce the need for agency staff and will put in place the permanent workforce that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#L02000","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Okay.

Having waited this long, I will try to exert what little influence I have.  We need to change the system a little.  Committee meetings are long and drawn out and this room is extraordinarily cold.  I am freezing to death down here, but perhaps it is only this part of the room.<\/p> <p>  I will take written answers to the following questions.  St. John of God's services are being discontinued from next year.  What preparations are being made for the replacement?  When will know exactly what it is and will it be sufficient to meet the requirements?  Those requirements are growing as opposed to otherwise.<\/p> <p>  What stage are we at with cervical cancer screening and bringing that up to date with the results of tests and continuous screening?  To what degree are patients continually informed, do they have to wait or are they asked to wait longer?<\/p> <p>  There are huge gaps in the system relating to child mental health.  That is worrying.  I have never seen it so bad.  Are there imminent signs of putting a system in place that responds adequately to the level of demand in respect of child mental health at the present time?<\/p> <p>  For children with special needs, such as those with autism, are there any plans to ensure continuity of services and various therapies and that there is not a tail-off?  At the moment, if a therapist goes on maternity leave there is no service for the child, which is a huge break and setback to the treatment level because the patient or child then regresses.

I want to ask about the same issue Deputy Durkan raised regarding children with special needs.  Mr. Sullivan spoke about recalibrating and remodelling how we deliver services.  During Covid, many of the hospitals and services we bought in such as Citywest were not being used and people said that was a missed opportunity to deal with some of the waiting lists.  Have we learned from mistakes that were made in the past?  Mr. Sullivan said in his submission that 98% of Sl&aacute;intecare projects were on track in June 2019.  It is now October 2020, so after seven months of Covid, what level of disruption does he estimate has been caused to that timeline?<\/p> <p>  As Deputies and Senators, we hear about the delayed diagnosis issue all the time.  For orthodontics or children with braces, the delays are years in some cases.  For ophthalmics, eyesight issues, or cataracts, people have to travel to the North in many cases.  In some cases they wait years or possibly worry about going blind.  Deputy Durkan also talked about kids with special needs waiting.  In CHO 7, which covers both our constituencies, children are waiting up to two years, or even two and a half, to get an assessment.  They then might have to wait another two and a half years to get speech and language therapy and so on.  We are talking in terms of 12 weeks to get into the system.  People at home want to know what is being done to fix the services that are clearly broken the areas we have outlined in those questions.  I do not know if the witnesses have time to answer as we only have a few minutes.  Perhaps they can come back to us.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the witnesses who did not get in and have waited patiently here throughout the session.

On the disability assessment of need, there were a huge number of people waiting for it.

We are awaiting details from each of the CHOs around the country on how they are going to clear those backlogs in a matter of months.  That funding is there for them to take up.  It is a significant amount of funding which is supposed to clear that whole backlog.  That is very good and means there will be a new disability network manager system where children will be referred in to get treatment directly in the disability networks.  Those people are now in place and they will be able to do their work with a clean sheet and without a backlog of people waiting.

I am sorry that I must leave a bit earlier than expected but, as members will know, there is a meeting of the Cabinet.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the LEADER programme, more than 3,400 projects were approved by the end of September that are worth &euro;135 million.  By the end of this year I expect the local action groups, LAGS, to have approved the full &euro;169 million available for project funding.  In 2019, the outturn was &euro;45 million with an allocation of &euro;40 million for 2020.  Activity on LEADER continued throughout the Covid-19 crisis and there is a spend of &euro;32 million to the end of September.  I expect that the outturn may again hit &euro;45 million.  I will deal with extra demand placed on the fund from savings under the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, programme.  Some projects, under the RRDF programme, have been delayed most likely due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>Almost &euro;100 million in project payments will remain to be made over the 2021 to 2023 period.  The project approvals under the current LEADER programme will finish at the end of this year.  The next programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest, due to delays in agreeing the overall EU budget.  However, project funding under the current programme will continue.<\/p><p> While the final announcements will be at the end of this year, it will take some time for the funding to be drawn down and the different projects to be delivered.  The staff in the LEADER companies will work with the promoters of these projects to ensure they are delivered.<\/p><p> The transitional regulations are still under negotiation but I am aware of the need to ensure smooth transition between programmes.  When I had the honour of being in this office previously, we had the exact same transition programme.  I accept there is uncertainty among the staff in the LEADER companies wondering whether they will have a job.<\/p><p> The Chairman is correct that it is important that the LEADER companies and their staff be fully utilised.  I expect they will be in finishing off this programme.  I am expanding the local employment services in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I hope LEADER companies will take the opportunity to deliver some of those programmes.  The Deputy referred to restart grants and trading online vouchers.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been doing amazing work across the country.  They have additional resources.  Businesses should go to their LEO if they are wondering what they should do about Brexit or Covid supports.  They will certainly give them the help they might need.<\/p><p> The LEADER staff will be quite busy rolling out remaining programmes.

Category 2 is aimed at giving the seed money so that organisations are ready to apply for category 1.  To date, 63 category 1 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;131 million.

When the applications come in, the projects are thoroughly assessed by an independent panel meaning that some good stuff comes through there.  It will take time to deliver those projects and Covid has led to delays on a number of fronts.  The RRDF has a key role in social and economic recovery.  We expect to ramp up the spending at the end of this year.  Normally many requests come into the Department at the end of the year.  Claims totalling &euro;4 million came in last week.  We prepay where it is warranted.  If we have good evidence that they will spend the money and they need it to help them avoid having to draw down overdraft facilities, etc., we try to work with the project promoters and help them insofar as we can.<\/p> <p>  The latest tranche of the town and village renewal scheme was announced earlier this week.  That was focused on measures to make towns and villages more Covid accessible and Covid-friendly.  Some great projects came in, including outdoor cinemas, outdoor seating and other imaginative stuff.  In this call we decided to include the towns with populations of more than 10,000, which had been left out.  Normally we do not include them because towns with a population of more than 10,000 can apply to the urban regeneration and development fund and we keep the town and village renewal scheme for the smaller towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the town centre first policy.  My Department is committed to developing the centre of towns.  We can make a real difference in the area of remote working.  The budget allocated an additional &euro;5 million to the town and village renewal scheme, specifically aimed at centre-of-town hubs and working spaces.  That will revitalise towns which have plenty of buildings that can easily be adapted for co-working spaces with high-speed good broadband.  I want to work with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the broadband issue.  Based on my experience in my previous Department I want to see more remote working and more investment in the regions and smaller towns.  I will also work with the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We need joined-up thinking involving IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government all working together to ensure we can revitalise town centres.<\/p> <p>  We had a pilot scheme with six towns from various parts of the country.  We have the report from those towns.  Most towns throughout the country have similar challenges and problems.  One of the big problems in the centres of towns is with the old buildings.  We need to find ways to incentivise people to renovate those buildings.  Sometimes when they renovate them, they find the commercial value considerably less than the cost of getting them back into shape again.  We need to work with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on that.  My local town of Clones had a major investment of &euro;5 million through the Department to regenerate some buildings and turn them into top-quality social housing.  It is about bringing people back into the towns either to live or to work there.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will hear me talking about remote or connected working and I hope to work with them on that because it is a game changer.  It was a dream or an aspiration this time last year and now it is a reality.  We need to grasp that for rural areas, run with it and make it happen.  Many people are working from home in their own communities.  We want them to stay in those communities.

There is no point in her saying that she is going to develop rural Ireland when other Departments are totally taking the legs from under her.  There is no point if the Department of Transport is not providing money for roads, if funding for water for people who are dependent on wells is not provided and broadband is not being rolled out fast enough.

We must have a coherent plan.  Cross-departmental development plans are essential in this context.  There is a piece missing in many of the conversations on connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#D00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I will start by providing clarity on the funding.  There is &euro;88 million in total, with &euro;53 million for the RRDF, &euro;25 million for the town and village renewal scheme and &euro;10 million for the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cuiv's point.  I understand the needs of people who do not live in villages or towns, the needs of somebody who lives in the heart of a parish in Aghabog, for example, on a farm.  I am delighted that my daughter is now building a house on the family farm and will continue that tradition and I want to protect people who want to do that.  It is only fair that such people get the services they need including broadband, water and electricity.  We have to help them and do so through a number of different schemes, particularly the local improvement scheme, LIS.  There is &euro;10 million in the LIS and I have secured an additional &euro;500,000 for next year.  That might not sound like a lot but it will assist with those lanes that badly need to be done.  I accept what the Deputy said about transport but we do have the Local Link service which helps to connect rural Ireland.  We have some very good local services in that regard.  I know my own constituency best where a service runs from Cavan to Monaghan five times a day, over and back.  It brings young people to institutes of further education and is a fantastic service.  We need more of that and we must fund more local public transport services.<\/p> <p>  I visited Glenasmole with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, recently for the launch of the broadband connection points initiative.  There will be 300 such points right across the country.  Glenasmole is at the foot of the Dublin mountains.  I thought that people living in Dublin had all the broadband they wanted but I discovered that they do not have it out in Glenasmole.  When I got there I saw so many similarities to where I live.  Sometimes we have the wrong idea in rural Ireland; we think that everyone in Dublin is connected but that is not the case.  I take Deputy Paul Donnelly's point about a blend of working from home and from hubs or offices.  People need connectivity to link in with their employers but it is also important for their mental health to get out of the house.  When people are working from home all day they have a starting time but it can be hard to find a finishing time.  It is better for people to be in a work environment that has the right furniture at the right level, the correct lighting and so on.  I am concerned that some people who are working from home are sitting on chairs that may cause back injuries or other problems.  Companies will be able to come together in these connection point buildings, enabling their employees to work remotely.  We must support that, manage it and provide that service because it will make a difference.  We have also invested a great deal of money in cycleways and walkways in rural Ireland so even if people live in the countryside they will be able to get on their bicycle and go into the local village to work.  This is something to which we should all aspire, namely, people not always needing to use their cars.  Often in rural Ireland, people need not one but two cars.  The objective is to bring work to communities and by doing so, we will revitalise towns and villages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#D00400","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>The additional &euro;500,000 for the LIS is welcome but there is a massive backlog there and we need once-off funding to clear it.

That is like saying that to be eligible for a scheme in the city two of the workers would have to be involved in the high-tech industry.  The vast majority of people living in rural Ireland today are not involved in agriculture.  It is unnecessarily restrictive.  I would say \"yes\" if it stated that they had to be permanent dwellings, not holiday homes.  That is fine, but I do not see why the scheme is specifying a particular occupation just because it was the dominant occupation 50 to 70 years ago.<\/p> <p>  Thankfully, we have retained our population where I live.

Now, after being closed for months, they are operating at 30% or 40% capacity.  The funding that is coming in would help to bring them up to a level where they are at least able to offer the minimum wage, if not the living wage, but it will be a massive challenge over the coming year.  I am really concerned, as are the organisations themselves, about how they are going to do that, bearing in mind that we are at level 3 and the infection rate numbers are not great.  I hope we do not go any higher than level 3 but there is a possibility that we will.  The organisations in question are worried about that and will have to take it into account when making their projections.<\/p><p> My second point relates to the overall programme.  We should be looking at bringing it up to minimum wage and then allowing any the excess profits that are made by particular projects to be pumped back into bringing people up to the living wage.  Not all of the programmes are at the living wage level but it is the minimum we should expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#F02500","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I have several points to make regarding subhead B12.  First, until a few years ago, participants in the schemes under the community services programme, CSP, were paid the full minimum wage by the Department and the latter also paid the employer's PRSI.  In what I thought was a very mean cutback, that was changed and now there is a contribution from the companies to the participants' wages.  Second, the companies also used to get a grant for general overhead costs, which was not needed by some of them but was needed by others.  The grant funding was tailored to prevent surpluses building up in some companies.  In the context of the Covid crisis, it is extremely important that money be made available for overhead costs.<\/p> <p>  My third point concerns the CSP companies that have suffered a severe income loss or had to close because of level 3 restrictions.  A lot of these organisations are either community centres or heritage sites.  Many heritage sites throughout the country are in community ownership, including, for example, the Dunbrody visitor centre, several sites in Donegal and Athenry Castle in County Galway.  Will those organisations be entitled to apply for the new scheme announced yesterday by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation?  Has there been any discussion with the T&aacute;naiste as to whether they will get a grant if they have to close because of the level 3 restrictions, which many have had to do already?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the fourth issue I wish to raise, it would have been helpful if the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, were still here to respond to it.  Departments tend to organise their affairs as if they were all competing football teams, not part of the same Government.  Any of us who have had the privilege of serving know that they look after their money and will always try to prevent it going to another Department.  I got into big trouble as a Minister when I helped another Department by moving people from community employment, CE, schemes onto a scheme operating in my Department, thereby freeing up CE places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, should put it to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that the net cost of creating more jobs under the CSP would be quite small given the huge savings it would bring in jobseeker's allowance and other payments, depending on which scheme people are on.  It is much easier to ask a Minister to take money out of his or her left pocket if one is going to put it back into his or her right pocket, although the departmental officials will still fight over it.  Even though there are two different Departments involved, at least it is the same head.<\/p> <p>  The State has invested big money to keep some community centres open from 8 o'clock in the morning until late at night post Covid and every one of them needs that money.  A lot of good new community heritage projects have been set up that will not be economic in themselves but will operate as loss leaders in their communities to attract people into all the other businesses in those communities, including bed and breakfast accommodation, restaurants and so on.  Does the Minister of State have plans to persuade the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to support these enterprises rather than having people paid to do nothing, which is very bad in terms of their morbidity?  People who are long-term unemployed tend to die younger, go to the doctor more often and take more medicine.  That is a scientific fact and it is nothing about the people themselves but simply because humans were not built for being idle.  Giving such people a meaning in their lives will bring them significant benefits.  The most frequent queries we got during my time in the Department were not about people being put on schemes but about people being put off schemes or trying to get on them.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State undertake to have a discussion with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and ask that she achieve a little saving out of welfare by transferring, say, 500 people to some of the new projects operating under the CSP?  We need to ensure that every large community centre in the country has the wherewithal to sweat its assets by being able to open all day.  Every heritage centre, including the new ones being developed, and other facilities, such as those for Travellers, should automatically be eligible for the fantastic programme that is the CSP.  The reality is that most of the people on these schemes will not get commercial jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#G00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I will try to answer all of the questions but members might let me know if I miss any of the specifics.  The CSP is a bit of a hotchpotch made up of a whole variety of different types of organisations throughout the country.  There are loosely three strands to the programme.  The largest strand, and the one members are probably most familiar with, includes a large number of community centres and heritage sites but also some organisations, like FoodCloud, which are quite different in their function.  The second strand is focused on social inclusion services.  The smaller third strand is specifically about creating employment for people who are the furthest from the labour market.  That is a very loose description of the three strands and there is a wide variety of organisations within the CSP.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows, the genesis of the programme was in an effort of pulling together different strands from different places.  Some organisations are general social enterprises and others not so much.  A lot of the work was started in the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment many years ago.<\/p> <p>  In the context of defining the current operation of the programme and its purpose, we asked Indecon to conduct a review of the CSP.  I signed off on that report and it was published a couple of weeks ago.  We are now starting a process of reforming the CSP for a variety of reasons, one of which is to ensure it fits into our five-year community and voluntary strategy.  The CSP, as it has been operating, was not very strategic and it was not very clear what exactly it was for.  It was, broadly speaking, about making sure that certain organisations, all of which were doing good work, got funding.  The Indecon review identified a need to be more strategic about the purpose of the programme.  To that end, one of the things we are likely to do is seek to tailor the funding and application processes for the different organisations and make the application process easier.  That work has already started and we are setting up a consultative group, which will include managers from the CSP organisations, community centres, the Irish Local Development Network and The Wheel, to discuss how we can reform the programme.  This Friday, I am meeting a number of managers from a variety of CSP organisations to ensure I stay in touch with what is happening in communities and the range of activity in this area.<\/p> <p>  I will try to address some of the specific questions that were put to me.  Some 20 or 30 organisations are in the pipeline to join the CSP.  One of the reasons we want to reform the programme is that there are lots of organisations that want to be included in it.  The idea is that for at least some of the participating organisations, they would be in the programme for a period of time and would then move on to function as social enterprises in their own right.  That has not tended to happen because of the way the scheme is currently set up.  Organisations get the funding and want to hang on to it and stay in the programme.  That approach is suitable for some organisations because it what they need and what we need to do for them.<\/p><p>There are approximately 20 or 30 in the pipeline.  Currently, we have stopped new entrants because we will be restructuring next year.<\/p><p> As the Deputy spoke about meals on wheels, an interesting point occurred to me.  Through my Department, Rethink Ireland had a &euro;5 million social innovation fund for Covid-specific responses.  As part of that, it has given a small grant to Irish Rural Link to co-ordinate meals on wheels at a national level.  It is a small grant but it is a big job to co-ordinate that process at a national level but it is something that might be of interest to the Deputy as the programme was mentioned.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Paul Donnelly, our view on funding is that we contribute a portion of the salaries of people who work in the programme he mentioned.  This was born out of an initial contribution some years back of what was the minimum wage.  It has not increased since and the Deputy has made a fair argument that it should be increased.  With regard to funding priorities, I am very concerned, like the Deputy, that some of these will not be able to stay open next year.<\/p><p> I can tell the Deputy in a straight and honest way that my priority in the budget negotiations was this as well.  The last thing I want to do is see any of these organisations that are so crucial in what they provide to communities around the country shutting next year.  It is in that context that we fought for more funding and we got &euro;2 million specifically to help organisations like that get through next year.  It will be difficult and many of these organisations depend on traded income, hall and room rental, which is just not happening now but overheads are still mounting.  We had a &euro;1 million support fund this year as well to help organisations get by.<\/p><p> I mentioned before that there is a bit of a natural rate of attrition as well and some organisations just do not fit the model we have.  Some fall out of the scheme and some decide to leave to go in a different direct.  We certainly do not want any organisations closing because of Covid-19.<\/p><p> I am trying to cover everything mentioned by Deputies as best I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#G00300","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I had a question on applications for business grants and so on.

I have mentioned subhead B11, the community enhancement programme, on several occasions.  A grant of &euro;2 million has been made.  I know of two community centres in my own community that are in need of 40% of that.  One is at risk of closing because it is in such poor condition.  It is one of those community centres and parish halls that are not local authority-run.  If a facility is run by a local authority it can get funding there, but a substantial number of groups must apply for community enhancement programme funding.  Perhaps other members know how many groups are in that position.  They get it in dribs and drabs.<\/p> <p>  Hartstown Community Centre sent me an absolutely brilliant business plan outlining operations in the next year, three years and five years.  The problem is that the centre has no guaranteed funding other than its own.  The Wheel and other organisations have raised the issue of multi-annual funding.  Multi-annual funding provides assurance.  If an organisation goes to a bank or credit union with a business plan, it can point to a facilities fund sponsored by the community enhancement programme that guarantees a certain income for the next three years.  It can then use that assurance to take on some risk.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, these community centres open in the morning and stay open as long as they can.  They try to open seven days a week to facilitate local dance groups, musicians and sports groups.  It is vital for the fabric of our communities that we keep all of these centres open so that the community can use them.  I am concerned because there is significant pent-up demand for funding.  Many of these facilities were built 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  A cr&egrave;che might offer a community centre a certain amount per year to rent the premises.  That is brilliant income, but Tusla is likely to rule that children cannot be cared for there under any circumstances because there are no proper fire doors, fire alarms or whatever.  Either the improvements have to be made, which costs an astonishing amount, or the centre must turn the business away.  In some cases, cr&egrave;ches have been there for years, but Tusla applies new rules demanding that massive changes be made or operations stop.  That rent is a big chunk of guaranteed income that enables community centres to subsidise dance clubs, football clubs, singing groups, karate clubs, etc., without charging commercial rates, which many clubs cannot afford.  I am very passionate about this issue because I know the effect it could have if centres cannot operate without that work being done and those managing the centres decide they cannot take on &euro;200,000 loans as personal risks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#J00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State responds to these points, I note that the community enhancement programme was also used to install defibrillators, which have been of great benefit to communities.

I know of a social enterprise in my constituency that would be prepared to assist with training and the capital cost of boxes for defibrillators throughout the country.  This enterprise could work with the Minister of State's Department for approximately the same amount that is being spent at the moment.  All we are doing at the moment is buying the defibrillators.  They are of no use If they are locked in a building between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. or if the staff are not trained.  Joined-up thinking is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#J00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Chair on that point.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Donnelly's point on funding for community centres, I reiterate that in January we provided Fingal County Council with &euro;40,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund to allow remedial work on Hartstown Community Centre and Huntstown Community Centre.  Huntstown Community Centre also received &euro;45,000 under the Covid-19 stability fund for community and voluntary, charity and social enterprises.  The community enhancement programme is similar to the local improvement scheme in that it is not an enormous fund but there is huge need out there for it.  Funding is allocated to local authorities, which each receive a certain amount.  When that is divided up again, the amounts are smaller still.  The local development companies within local authorities make decisions on the funding.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on multi-annual funding.  Coming from the community and voluntary sector myself, I know it is the golden ticket that enables organisations to plan.  It does happen on some occasions.  One of the main objectives of the five-year community and voluntary sector strategy I am overseeing is to facilitate more multi-annual funding for organisations across the community and voluntary sector.  That is a big job.  If we achieved some of it over the next few years, it would be a big win.  The Deputy's point that community centres have major needs for upgrading, structural works, etc., is well made.  We will continue to look at options, but the community enhancement programme is the most obvious one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#J00400","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>If I may wear one of my previous hats, I note that substantial funding is available from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.

Volunteering was structured and organised fantastically through Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>We overcame one issue, which always has puzzled me.  I worked previously for Tusla, and in one year I was Garda vetted on five occasions.  I was smiling in respect of the volunteer list.  I wondered how we were going to get those people vetted, including some in our club who had been Garda vetted, albeit for GAA activities, and others who had not been Garda vetted at all because they were parents.  Then, miraculously, it happened.  While I know this is not the Department responsible, Garda vetting is very important in the context of volunteering.  I hope it will be possible to have a conversation with the relevant Department regarding the creation of just one certificate.  In other words, when being Garda vetting for 2021, I refer to the ability to bring evidence of that vetting around to other organisations so that it is not necessary to repeat the process continuously.  Having to do that puts people off.  It frustrates them, slows down the process greatly and is a major issue in respect of volunteering.  We have a wonderful history of volunteering and that really was on display during the Covid-19 crisis through the numbers of people who were willing to help.  I had nearly 90 people on a list, who were willing to go out every day to shop, to collect medicines from pharmacies or to cut grass or whatever was required by older and vulnerable citizens.  I would welcome some co-ordination in the system about volunteering and how it might be possible to get one certificate and to avoid wasting Garda time with vetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#J00700","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I will start with a straightforward and simple question.  Is the Covid-19 stability fund exhausted or will there be further approvals of allocations?  My second question is also straightforward.  Does the Minister of State have responsibility for dormant accounts and can he tell me the total amount of money in the fund, net of the statutory reserve that must be kept and of any money kept aside for projects that already have been allocated funding?<\/p> <p>  My third question refers to something not in the Estimate and which I regret disappeared from it in 2012, namely, the RAPID programme.  It was set up to deal with what are, scientifically and sociologically, based on census data, the most deprived communities in the country.  Every one of those communities was an urban one.  I never buy the argument that any rural communities are as deprived - and I take the whole meaning of the word \"deprived\" - as are some of the urban communities in this country.<\/p> <p>  The idea was that we would build a big wall around those communities in respect of funding but not anything else.  This was because, as we have seen in the past, more affluent areas are much better able to grab the money.  All sorts of people, outside of the relevant areas, get money for community development within deprived areas but sometimes that can be queried.  The RAPID programme had some interesting characteristics in that regard.  There was an area implementation team, AIT, on which people who actually lived in local authority housing had guaranteed representation.  The Garda and the VECs were also included, as were other organisations.  <\/p> <p>  Money was given by the Department.  That meant that if community representatives, who actually lived the reality of life in an area, did not sign off on proposed projects, such as playgrounds, for example, those projects would not happen and the Department would not pay.  In any co-funded scheme, therefore, the local representatives were the people with the ultimate choice as to whether a project would go ahead.  The counter veto was with the local authority in respect of its half of the funding.  It was necessary, therefore, to get both sides to agree for a project to go ahead.  That type of set-up, however, stopped the domineering effect of people from the outside always telling people in more disadvantaged communities what was good for them.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, dormant accounts money totalling &euro;100,000 was also being given every year for small things.  It went through the AIT and it spent the money.  There was again specific ring-fencing in respect of the power of the community representatives.  For the first time in their lives, they were part of the decision-making process.  That meant that it was not always somebody else making their decisions for them.  For whatever mad reasons, which I have never understood because these are, scientifically, the most deprived communities, this focused and targeted scheme was abolished.  All I got in reply to parliamentary questions as to why that happened was a load of raim&eacute;is. <\/p> <p>  It seemed to me that some interests got at this programme because they did not like it.  Local authority managers did not like it either and that was because somebody else could ensure that the money was spent.  Places like the Oliver Bond Street flats complex, which was in the news recently, saw great friendships created.  For the first time, people in places like that had a real say in what was happening.  They were at the table as equals and they had their share of the money.  Other people did not then always have control of the money, because the local people had their veto as well.<\/p> <p>  It is not the Minister of State's fault that the programme does not now exist because he is new in the Department.  I am glad that he comes from the voluntary sector.  It seems that three of us here come from a background in that sector, or perhaps the five of us present do.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the RAPID programme as it was in its heyday, taking into account the psychological empowerment that came with that programme.  We are always talking about empowerment and we were giving real control to people in that programme.  Will the Minister of State look at that model and consider whether it should be reinstated?  I have never believed there was a valid reason to get rid of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#K00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  While we are on subhead B3, the senior alert scheme has been very successful.  I see this year that &euro;5.3 million has been allocated for it.  Again, however, no more than in the case of the defibrillators, we could do much more with that money regarding the types of devices we are providing to older people.  When we are connecting people to the Internet, we could provide them with a laptop or a smartphone, and combine monitoring and communication in the senior alert scheme.<\/p> <p>  I refer to providing mobility in this context, because, thankfully, older people today are not physically confined to the home.  They are at the moment, sadly, because of Covid-19, but otherwise many older people are often outside.  Having a device connected to a mobile network, in respect of an alarm or a fall, means that an alert can be triggered by someone in a field in the middle of nowhere, out in a park or out for a walk on the street, instead of the fixed scheme existing now.

To my knowledge, there are plans for higher technology devices to come on stream.  I need to confirm that but I recall that there were plans in that regard.  The lot option for the forthcoming scheme in 2021 has been confirmed, along with the technical specifications for the telecoms equipment to be included.  Work is ongoing at interdepartmental level to explore the potential amalgamation, in the medium term, of the senior alert scheme into broader assistive technology schemes operated by the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There has, therefore, been some thinking on this issue, and it looks like there will be some sort of product at the end of it.  There is definitely great potential in linking up with other technologies and other needs.<\/p> <p>  If the committee does not mind, I will go backwards and address the questions from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I have been thinking about how to empower communities and give them a voice at a grassroots level and how that was done in the past.  That was one of the first things I started thinking about when I got the job.  I have also been talking to organisations about this matter and how it might be done.  <\/p> <p>  We got new funding, albeit a small amount, of &euro;1 million yesterday to start some pilot schemes next year with a view to growing this kind of approach again.  I come from the sector and know how valued that approach was.  I acknowledge that it has dissipated or diminished over time and in the past ten to 15 years especially.  This is, therefore, a small measure being undertaken to try to restart that approach in a small way.  Many good things have also happened in the same period, however, particularly concerning the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  As I know it is not perfect, this is about finding spaces for it to develop.<\/p><p>I have been thinking about it and there will be something happening on it next year.<\/p><p> On the question relating to the Dormant Accounts Fund, I do not have all the figures that the Deputy asked for, but the 2020 action plan was approved with more than &euro;45 million worth of measures included, &euro;12.6 million of which rests with the Department of Rural and Community Development, and the remaining &euro;32.4 million is spread across eight other Departments.  I will look into getting other figures for the Deputy.  <\/p><p> We obviously dipped into the Dormant Accounts Fund substantially this year for the stability fund, which I can talk about because I have some figures with me.  The majority of the moneys have been disbursed.  Approximately 560 organisations received grants from the fund.  There is not a lot left and some applications are still under appeal.  However, the good news on the stability fund is that an additional &euro;10 million has been allocated to the fund in the budget, which is to be used before the end of this year.  We are in the process of figuring out how best to use it, because we have to do it quickly and use it by the end of the year.<\/p><p> On the issue of Garda vetting raised by Deputy Donnelly, it goes into the broader issue of volunteering.  I am pushing to bump up where volunteering sits in the national psyche and in the community voluntary sector.  There is huge potential and a significant volume of good work is being done, but it needs a framework, direction and proper funding.  Those things are happening, and I am glad that we will publish the first national volunteering strategy before the end of the year.  Without revealing too much of its contents, there is an action included in respect of Garda vetting.  The issue of Garda vetting is a problem not only for the volunteering sector.  I know that it is also an issue for sporting organisations, and it can be frustrating to have to repeat the process of vetting, so there are wider issues to consider.  However, in respect of volunteering, Garda vetting is on the list of issues that we need to address. The policy on volunteering will be coming out and there has been a significant increase in funding from &euro;3.5 million to &euro;5.1 million next year.  This will allow us to finally open a volunteering centre in every local authority area.  Currently eight areas do not have a centre.  At the end of next year we should have a full national network of volunteering centres, which is crucial for many reasons.  The evidence is that if people want to volunteer and can talk to a professional about it, they are much more likely to follow through rather than just send an email and hope something happens.  If people sit down with someone in a volunteering centre to discuss the options and the support framework, they will be more likely to volunteer.  It was one of the big positives that came out of yesterday's budget that I was glad to see.  We will be able to put volunteering on a much more solid level and will ultimately develop a national volunteering corps.  <\/p><p> Covid-19 really has shown the value of volunteering.  Committee members will be well aware of this but people are still helping at Covid testing centres through volunteering, both informally and through volunteer centres.  The ESRI is engaged in research which seeks to measure the value, reach and scope of the community call initiative, which continues at local authority level.  All the local authorities are meeting this week because the country has moved to level 3.  That research is trying to measure the value of community call and I will be interested to see what value we can take from it and what can continue, and how we can support that engagement from local organisations and volunteers to help people in their communities that need it most.  I think that broadly covers most of the questions asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#K00400","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Before we go any further, we have 16 minutes left.

We had community development workers in community centres working on the ground, and the then decision was made to withdraw them to office work, and a connection was then lost.

It is a very similar situation to the north inner city where there have been serious issues with gangland murders.  Darndale is close to my heart because I worked in Coolock for almost 19 years, I know the place really well, and I knew some of the young people who were killed last year.  I am wondering how the funding was allocated to implement the recommendations of the Nolan report.  When I read the report on Darndale, I did not see a reference to a co-ordinating group.  There are many tasks for different agencies, but I could not see one group to oversee the work.

Yesterday's budget was a good day for the arts.  I acknowledge that the NCFA did not do it alone.  All committee members and their parties have been incredibly supportive of the NCFA in addressing the dire needs of the arts sector since the pandemic started.  I wanted to put a big thank you from us and the 54,000 people we represent on the record.<br\/><br\/>The NCFA represents more than 54,000 artists, arts workers and arts organisations who make up Ireland&rsquo;s internationally acclaimed innovative and intelligent arts ecosystem.  We represent makers, organisations, theatre companies, producers, colleges, venues, arts centres, galleries and publishers.  The NCFA speaks and plans for both the tip of the iceberg and the many crucial layers of ice that lift that tip out of the water.<br\/><br\/>The Covid-19 crisis has created profound challenges for the arts, culture and live events sector which have compounded years of underinvestment.  Throughout 2020 the NCFA has engaged in cross-sectorial consultation with artists and arts workers, as well as the resource organisations which work with them.  On 27 May, the NCFA published a national recovery plan for the arts containing 13 actions essential for survival and recovery.<br\/><br\/>According to a report by consultants, EY, completed on behalf of the Arts Council, published last weekend, the recession faced by the arts and culture sector will be -55% compared to -11% in the economy overall.  Data currently available predicts that employment levels in the arts and culture sector will not return to 2019 levels until 2025.  Analysis by the ESRI shows how value added in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors collapsed by 72%, compared with an average decline of 29% across the rest of the EU.<br\/><br\/>The arts, culture and events sector is hardest hit because it is public facing, seasonal and composed mostly of SMEs and freelance workers.  In June and July, the additional investments by the Government were vital in stemming the losses faced by many artists, arts workers and arts organisations.  However, the sector remains in crisis.  This investment represented a positive first step in recognising the value of our arts community.  Yesterday's budget measures for the arts should also be included in those positive steps.<br\/><br\/>After positive moments of reopening and re-engagement with our audiences, however, the return to level 3 restrictions means all arts and culture organisations are now closed.  Social distancing measures will continue to mean that events and gatherings are simply not viable.  These restrictions remain regardless at which level of the living with Covid plan we are.  EY predicts that recovery will take two years or longer depending on the evolution of the virus.<br\/><br\/>The publication of the report, Survive, Adapt, Renew, by the Arts Council&rsquo;s Covid-19 expert advisory group, of which the NCFA was a member, and the ongoing work of the arts and culture recovery task force are welcome.<br\/><br\/>The NCFA's pre-budget submission for 2021 called for the Government to ensure artists and arts workers are supported through the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and employment wage subsidy scheme until mass gatherings are permitted again and cultural events can take place at full capacity; ensure that the rate of the PUP returns to &euro;350 for the arts and events sector; increase funding to the Arts Council to &euro;135 million in 2021 with a view to at least doubling investment in the Arts Council by 2025; prioritise and expedite the trial for universal basic income, outlined in the programme for Government, as well as to develop a universal basic income model for all citizens over the lifetime of the Government; and classify local authority arts spending as a mandatory requirement.<br\/><br\/>The NCFA supports the call to commission a review of taxation practice as it relates to the arts.  We encourage total insurance reform and call for the transposition of the European Union&rsquo;s directive on copyright for the Digital Single Market into national law by June 2021.<br\/><br\/>We recognise that the Government is taking the appropriate steps to protect public health and it has acknowledged the significant challenges faced by the arts and culture sector as a result of these measures.<br\/><br\/>The arts have provided respite and solidarity for adults and children across the island during the past eight months of the crisis.  Never has it been more evident that all our citizens lose out when artists can no longer produce their work.<br\/><br\/>We would like to end with a quote from the EY report on the arts:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe arts could act during the crisis as a civic force field enriching our cultural lives.  It provides joy and inspiration; it helps to energise us; it is a gateway for people to experience our society and all it has to offer.  Covid-19 has brought the importance and value of community into focus and in many ways the arts sector is synonymous with community as a place and an expression of positivity.  For this reason ... it should be at the heart of our recovery strategy. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dorgan for her opening statement.

The arts organisations, along with community and sports groups, are taking us through this period.  We will come through it.<\/p> <p>  The role of the arts task force, established by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is to see us through this period.  One of the challenges, however, is the big picture vision and how will the arts rebuild Ireland.  Crucial to that is the role of the arts and entertainment industries in our local communities.  I am referring to professional, amateur and voluntary organisations.  What more can we do to support venues, as many of them are under pressure?  The issue of insurance reform would have been high on the NCFA's agenda.<\/p><p>I know the Irish Street Arts, Circus &amp;amp; Spectacle Network, ISACS, and others have been quite keen to push that.

Obviously, many musicians and others are out of work or with minimum levels of work.  Some of the changes to the PUP announced yesterday are positive.  What more can be done to support those?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#B00400","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I will start with the Senator's last question and work back.  I might just leave PUP because many people might have questions on that, and it is a very specific aspect that remains important for freelance workers.  If members will pardon the pun, this is a gig economy.  Specifically, for musicians and the entertainment sector yesterday's budget was really welcome with the &euro;50 million for small venues and larger venues as well as the SME supports.  Not just in the response of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, but also in the whole-of-government response to this sector, there are elements that will help those individuals.  The housing policy will make paying rent more feasible.  Specifically, those in the music sector will benefit from the &euro;50 million for venues because they are aimed at performances and getting event workers, sound engineers, stagehands etc. back to work in the venue.<\/p> <p>  Separately from that, my company, First Music Contact, is administering the music industry stimulus package for the Department and we have judges looking at a significant number of applications - nearly 1,800 across the three schemes.  We have provided money to fund writing camps, recording EPs, singles and albums, and then releasing albums.  Normally musicians would use their fees from festivals and other bookings towards those kinds of activities to further their career development.  The music industry stimulus package, the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced in July is answering some of those alongside that live element.  From my reading of the budget, both of those will also be allowed for in 2021.  That will also get to artists and individual events workers in that sector.<\/p> <p>  Local activity is an interesting one.  As the Senator acknowledged, the NCFA represents 54,000 individuals and organisations.  Those organisations in their communities had an all-of-community response to the crisis.  The arts infrastructure in those communities, including the local arts officers, need to be supported.  They need to have local authority funding for the arts protected against difficult times.  Some of the decisions in the budget yesterday, including providing money back into the local authorities to replace the lost income from the waived commercial rates will really help with that.  It will help individual artists and I am sure it will also help the coffers of local authorities.<\/p> <p>  The EU directive being signed into law in June is really important.  Many musicians and anybody representing their art and copyright digitally now stands to make more income from them, but the EU directive will make that income larger.  All the member states have signed up to it.  The Government has until June 2021 to sign that into law.  That will make a significant difference on a day-to-day basis to the moneys these musicians and artists with copyright can collect from the large tech companies from their music and stuff being online.  Again, that drives income.<\/p> <p>  Performance recording and releasing work stimulates more work.  The Arts Council giving funding to organisations to pivot to digital output means that while artists may not be able to do a ticketed event in a venue, they may be able to do some ticketed events behind a paywall.  A number of organisations, including mine, have done that recently, the theatre festival and the fringe festival being two other noticeable events in this part of the year.<\/p> <p>  Local arts activity is very important for the three layers of what matters in the arts.  It is the artist, the arts worker and the arts organisation, but it also is the audience.  We are often asked what arts are for.  The answer is always, \"Everything and everyone.\"  I think it was more than demonstrated during the pandemic that, without knowing it, that cog turned in all our minds, reminding us just how valuable the arts are.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to note that many artists are returning home.  Some people were stuck back in Cork - I think that is the best thing that could happen to someone - and stuck back in their own cities and counties or isolated there.  They have stayed there and will recontribute to local activity.  However, the arts centre, the venue, the activity, the resource organisation, the choir, the band and other activities that were able to flourish locally need to be supported to remain.  The individuals in them through PUP and the organisations which drive that activity and create those opportunities for engagement also need to be funded.  It was great to see Creative Ireland get an extra &euro;3 million in yesterday's budget because it has wonderful programmes for community and local engagement for the arts.<\/p> <p>  I ask the committee to support anything that comes from the task force.  I am on the task force on behalf of the NCFA and so unfortunately cannot say much about it because we agreed to that before we entered into it.  I am confident that what the NCFA has asked for, as presented to the committee today, will turn up in different parts as well as other needs from the wider sector outside the NCFA, like audiovisual and events.  It is really representative.  I have been very impressed by the collegiality in that task force and it is well put together.   Without commenting on it, because I cannot, I encourage members of the committee to support anything coming out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Insurance reform has a particular impact on the arts sector.

In our pre-budget submission - colleagues of ours have spoken about this - we advocated for insurance reform.  A particularly clear solution would be the establishment of a State insurance scheme by IPB Insurance for the those in the arts and culture sector who are in receipt of State funding.  The artists who operate small companies in particular areas often struggle to get insurance cover.  Something like that would make a major difference.  That particularly impacts people who work in the circus and street artist sectors and people working in some areas of dance.  Other areas of general insurance reform could be very positive.

We have been experiencing precarity in the arts since long before this crisis.  What the crisis has done is exacerbate it.  So far, the PUP has been an extraordinary support and a real boon for the sector to keep people surviving.  There are major concerns, however, about where we are going next with it.  Certainly, the tiered payment levels are causing an awful lot of stress and concern within the sector.  Many people are struggling to survive.  We have a high cost of living in Ireland.  For those who are struggling already, it has become a real struggle and they are concerned about whether they will be able to pay their rent or mortgage or support their families.  A large number of our members contact us regularly and they are very concerned about what will happen next, particularly when the payment is reduced and, ultimately, phased out completely in April 2021.  As we are aware, this virus will continue for some time, with projections showing it will be here until the end of next year, if not longer.

It will probably happen anyway but is it time to consider a better geographical spread when disbursing the Arts Council's budget?  Some local authorities spend a couple of cents per head of population on their arts budget.  There is, therefore, a democratic deficit arising from how we spend money on the arts across the State.

As far as we are concerned, we can never go back to a budget of less than &euro;130 million.  As the Senator acknowledged, it was death by a thousand cuts in the sector before we the pandemic.  The arm's length principle operating in the arts sector means that none of us can decide how the Arts Council spends its money.  I am encouraged that the Arts Council advisory group, on which we sat as the precursor to the task force, will look at how it delineates money provided as bursaries to artists and survival grants to organisations.  It is important to note the organisations funded by the Arts Council create work and income opportunities for individuals as well.  That trickles down but also takes time.<\/p> <p>  The wider conversation, especially now with people moving back to counties, is to better fund the local authorities.  How the Arts Council delineates its money and plans to help the sector survive and thrive is in its plan, which is available for everybody to look at.  In terms of what more we can do, reinstating the &euro;350 pandemic unemployment payment rate is the primary goal for events and arts workers, for all individuals.  We must remember that the people on whose behalf we are trying to work are individuals whose lived experience is one of daily fear.  We are having Zoom calls with 500 people who are experiencing that fear.  We feel that and I know members at local level have all felt it as well.  We must expedite support for those individual lived experiences because we cannot just live through the pandemic.  We must have a life in it.  Life cannot stop.  It is for the mental health of the nation.  That is what the arts will try to do and it behoves us to support the artists first so they continue to work.  Many of the responses we received indicated that the &euro;350 pandemic unemployment payment meant that people were not in a panic every day.  The PUP is the priority.<\/p> <p>  The second layer is always the need for more funding.  Members will all agree that any investment in the arts is well spent.  It also makes sense economically because every euro invested in the arts makes its way back to the Exchequer in VAT, rent, PAYE and all of that.  That applies more to the arts than to most other industries.  It also makes economic sense to keep the pandemic unemployment payment at &euro;350 because people can then spend it on butter, bread, eggs and rent.  They have to survive.  If we do not protect our individual lived experience artists, performers and makers, art-making itself will constrict.<\/p> <p>  The other major fear of the NCFA and the sector in its entirety is that we have no idea how much flight from the arts there will be or if there will be an arts sector after this pandemic if we do not react swiftly to support these individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I will finish on this.

Unless one lives in a person's shoes, one cannot understand the sheer misery and sense of fear and hopelessness of our artists across the board and the impact that has on the lives of ordinary people who value all the artists, music, song, dance, culture, venues and everything else.  It is a complex situation.<\/p> <p>  I have been contacted by many musicians.  This question is not to Ms Dorgan personally.  Who exactly does the NCFA represent?  I am aware that Ms Dorgan explained that but people think they are not being represented on the ground.  I will explain later.  Who does Ms Dorgan believe will be the biggest casualty?  I know there are many casualties and that is probably an unfair question.  We are all casualties, I suppose.<\/p> <p>  The funding of &euro;130 million and then &euro;50 million provided for artists is substantial and I am delighted with it.  The issue is the vehicles and distribution methods for getting that to the people who need it, namely, the man or woman in the van and the entertainer with the expensive equipment who does cabaret in pubs, that side of things.  These people are treated mercilessly by the banks.  I am glad there is a Cabinet sub-committee to deal with insurance reform but what is missing is something to deal with the banks.  The moratorium on mortgages has ended and many people are not sleeping at night.  They are sick with fear.  Their houses are mortgaged and their vans must have a national car test certificate and safe transport certificate.  Much of the equipment value is on loans and hire purchase or whatever.  Many of them have a lien against their house covering their vans and equipment.  There is also back-up lighting and sound engineers.  There is a great deal of detail in all of that.<\/p><p>The money announced is great but will it get down to individuals?  People across the country fear it may not but it needs to.  I have received a short note.  The person who wrote it has also written to our Chairperson, Deputy Smyth, whom I congratulate.  This person wrote on behalf of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, with regard to the work of the committee and seeks a meeting to discuss further works.  Other people and groups will have to come before the committee.  <\/p><p> We also need to engage with the dance schools.  Perhaps we can do so at a later meeting.  I have letters from Alison Cronin and from some dance schools.  I have to declare an interest in this matter.  My niece runs Club Rince Nic Craith, the McGrath School of Irish Dance.  It wants to be included because it cannot understand the situation.  It abided by all the rules and made the required preparations in its studios or halls.  It has now been closed twice and cannot understand why.  A national school can have 30 kids in a classroom.  That is great but dancing is part of education.  It might be as part of a musical or whatever.  It could be any kind of dance, from traditional to modern and anywhere in between.  <\/p><p> Let us take, for example, Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; in Cashel.  It is run by Comhaltas and a former Senator was involved in it.  It needs to be embraced and it needs engagement.  Its classes usually cater for numbers lower than one would find in a classroom.  Why is it being singled out for unfair treatment?  We must try to educate in a holistic way.  Musical talent must be exploited.  People need that; it is very good for us.  Some students are more interested in it.  They have lost all their scores, r&eacute;iteoir&iacute;, Comhaltas events and fleadhanna this year.  Everything has been taken from them.  They need to be back in tuition.  The dance teachers also need to be supported.  They cannot understand this.  These dance schools were only allowed to operate with pods of six when they were open and they are now closed completely while the schools are open.  They also need to be supported.

We in the arts sector really appreciate that NPHET and the Department of Health have decisions to make.  Nobody in the arts sector wants to put public health in danger.<\/p> <p>  Other organisations represent events companies.  A number of organisations represent technical personnel.  One such organisation, the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC, appeared before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response with us.  I understand that much of the &euro;50 million announced in yesterday's budget is for that sector - the venues, the lighting and sound engineers, and the people who make their living in that previously commercial part of the sector.  There is quite a substantial number of such people.  The music industry stimulus package is also aimed at the commercial musicians who found themselves outside the scope of Arts Council or local arts office funding so I believe they are allowed for.<\/p> <p>  On a very brief reading yesterday, I saw some great SME supports of which many of those lighting and technical companies with overheads can avail.  They will now get local rates reductions and freezes, for which the local authorities will be reimbursed.  The employee wage subsidy scheme has been extended to the end of next year and a new scheme whereby companies that can show their VAT returns and income for this time last year can apply for up to &euro;5,000 to support and retain their staff.

As she said herself, it took a pandemic to get cogs turning in people's heads as to how important the arts industry, events and live entertainment are to us.  It certainly exacerbated the situation of artists with regard to low income but, if there is a silver lining to it, it put a national focus on the plight of artists not just now, but before the pandemic, with regard to low incomes.  In her contribution, Ms Dorgan said that one of the most important things for us to work on, whether through the Department, the Arts Council or another body, is ensuring that there is an arts and events industry after the pandemic.  We need to ensure that.  Even from a regional perspective, I am from west Cork and know that the likes of Clonakilty, Skibbereen and even villages like Ballydehob thrive on music and arts-based festivals.  Many of these festivals rely on sound engineers and musical groups doing gigs for next to nothing.  They rely on the goodwill of the local arts community.  That needs to be maintained in post-pandemic Ireland and that can only happen if we ensure the sector's survival.<\/p> <p>  I had the pleasure of seeing my first live gig in months down in west Cork when we were still at level 2.  It was socially distanced and all above board.  Hearing live music and harmonies again was absolutely incredible and reaffirmed how important it is.  One really realises how much one misses festivals like the Clonakilty International Guitar Festival, my favourite weekend of the year because of the buzz it brings to the region, when it has to go online.  Although the organisers made a valiant effort to replicate the festival, it was not the same.  I am just reaffirming what Ms Dorgan has already said about the importance of protecting the sector.<\/p> <p>  My questions and comments relate to the PUP.  I accept that it is requested and desired that it be reinstated to the full rate of &euro;350.  I genuinely believe the decision to allow people to take on intermittent work and to earn on top of the current payment was made, first and foremost, with the idea of allowing events and live industry workers to take on intermittent work in mind.  That is obviously difficult when we are at level 3 but, should we go back to level 2, it will be much more of a possibility.  I met with the Taoiseach and members of EPIC in Clonakilty a few months ago and the group's very first suggestion was that workers be allowed keep the full PUP while taking work when it was available.  The feedback I have got from local sound engineers in west Cork is that is a very welcome move.  What are Ms Dorgan's thoughts on it?  I sense she feels it is not quite enough but I genuinely believe the decision was taken with the arts and events industry in mind so I would like to get her feedback as to how it might help the sector survive and get by until after the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#E01100","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>It is incredibly useful, important and welcome.<\/p><p>It means people can earn up to &euro;480 on top of their payment over a month, which is incredibly useful.  It brings people nearly to the PUP rate prior to the cut.  For us, it would be amazing if it was &euro;350 plus &euro;480.  There were up to 500 artists at our Zoom events and they said their activity was almost frozen.  They were afraid to come off the PUP in case they did not get back on it, even if they got little spurts of work, such as a week at a festival, because they knew would they need support again and these events are so few and far between, with even online events being sporadic.  We have to be fair.  There has to be an opt-in element for artists and if we make an online event available, maybe some of them will not want to do it, and that is okay too. <\/p><p> That new addition is welcome, although it would have been amazing to have it on top of the &euro;350 for the individual.  I agree with the Deputy.  There are so many nights that we would have done at De Barra's and in Leap, and that is where we cut our gig teeth.  I am from Cork city but many buses went up and down to Leap.  It is great that Sam McNicholl and all the people in De Barra's and Connolly's can now apply for funding to try to be a little more imaginative, although they will be restricted depending on whether we are in level 2, 3 or 4. There is an excitement in that as well and, as the Deputy said, when they start programming again, there will still have to be musicians who can afford to work in music.<\/p><p> All artists and musicians are used to living in the gig economy.  However, we have to do better by them than a bit of a bursary here and a bit of social welfare there, while allowing them to earn up to a certain amount.  We owe them more than that.  With regard to the PUP staying at &euro;350, some mechanisms are being looked at by the task force that could allow it to be combined.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question directly, it is very welcome but it would have been great to see it on top of the &euro;350. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Ms Dorgan mentioned the move to online streaming and there was unbelievable innovation, particularly during April and May, when we were locked down.

During the early months of the pandemic, the Ireland Performs events - I am thinking of Mick Flannery - were great and had huge audiences.  We have to keep in mind that not all performances translate digitally and, for example, while a dance performance can be viewed digitally, it is in person that we get the magic.  As the Deputy said, even though it is good to have music digitally, it is always better to be there.<\/p> <p>  I was spoiled in that we run Ireland Music Week, which is the annual showcase of new music, and we had four days of pre-filming in September and it then went out behind a paywall last week.  To hear that first note and that first &ldquo;One, two&rdquo; in the room, and then to see 50 people perform and have that filmed, was magic.  It is something we are all missing and that digital experience will not replace it. <\/p> <p>  On the broader conversation, I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath that the best scenario is if we are all in a room and people can get back to making a living.  Until we get there, the support of the individual is going to be paramount, as well as the Arts Council getting enough funding to support the sector to survive and to be ready to thrive at the other end, and the venues also being in receipt of funding.  We need to have all of those together.  However, we have to lead on that and we have to be better for our citizens who work in that sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":541,"content":"<p>We are short on time so I ask members to keep their contributions short.

It is no more than the sector deserves and, pandemic or not, it is recognition of decades of hard graft by numerous people, many in a voluntary capacity.  I want to tease out not so much how the additional money will be spent, but the point touched on by the witnesses, who acknowledged that many competing interests are looking for that money within one sector.  Ms Dorgan used the phrase &ldquo;trickle down&rdquo;, which is a phrase also used earlier on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; by a member of the arts sector when wondering how this funding would trickle down.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  First, the witnesses referred to the task force and to the adjudication of that.  Are they happy supports will be delivered in a timely fashion, given there are so many aspects to be deliberated on?<\/p> <p>  Second, the witnesses mentioned a possible avenue of better funding for local authorities.  I want to put a caveat on that even though many local authorities are particularly good in this area.  I am from Navan.  The Meath local authorities have the Solstice Arts Centre, which is a very visible physical edifice that supports theatre, live arts, galleries and so forth.  However, it is also a massive drain on resources in respect of fixed costs.  If we were to support local authorities in regard to the arts, I am sure there could be those in the finance sections who would think they would be helping the arts by paying the debt.  There is that caveat.  The witnesses may say they think we would be doing good by supporting the local authorities, but when they are supported, it is a matter of how that strand of funding is spent.  I would be interested to hear their thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  Ms O&rsquo;Donoghue touched on the challenges in 2021 and this relates to Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan's point on ways of reimagining those arts festivals in 2021 and how an income can be derived from them.  While the increased funding yesterday was very welcome, the model, like so many other things, is obviously broken, and we had the sports sector before the committee last week with similar issues.  There is the question of how we reimagine that model to make sure it is not a case of continued Government support being the only way this sector will survive, but also how that model can be reimagined to raise finance during what is likely to be an even more challenging year next year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#F00500","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I might refer the Deputy back to Mr. O'Brien on the larger local arts question.  In terms of the question on where the funding would go and how it is matched, for the arts sector in general, as members have said, this money, while welcome, is overdue.  It is very important, when we are talking about any investment, that the question of State intervention is always a part of what is a three-part funding model for most of the arts sector.  That funding model comprises support from either a local arts authority or the Arts Council, self-generated income such as box office activity and programming, and then sponsorship and philanthropy.  Very few arts organisations funded through the Arts Council model are wholly and 100% reliant on Arts Council or State funding.<\/p> <p>  The challenge for 2020-21 and, as the report set out, up to 2025, is that it is not going to be a question that this sector keeps coming back for more money but to sustain the sector so it can get back to being as robust as it was.  Two thirds of the funding that generates around the arts and the value of the arts in society is non-State funded.  It is an investment that has other models attached but it is also an investment that comes back into the Exchequer.  It is not a handout situation but a collaborative situation, where the arts sector delivers social cohesion and comfort and interpretation of our lives in return, and the State supports that.  What is usual in arts organisations is that it is a house of cards in terms of how that is all put together.  The arts sector in general is to be commended for being able to keep that going for so long.  However, when we take away one of those key areas, which the pandemic has done, there is a case to be made for support.<\/p><p>Thankfully, it has been heard and delivered and State funding, for a time, until the restrictions are lifted, will be needed.  It is not only to get us through this.  We will keep coming back.  More investment is needed in the arts so that more organisations can survive and thrive.  We need it for new organisations as well.  We are a new society.  There are people left outside the funding loop because there is limited funding.  We will need more funding, including more youth arts funding, as we become a more diverse society with more diverse arts organisations.  It is encouraging to see the Arts Council leading the way on that with its human rights policy.  The council recognises that in its funding.  There will be more to make it more diverse, but it would not be correct to assume that the reason for supporting people through a pandemic is anything other than another measure for those in the arts who generate income for themselves.  That option has been taken away from the arts.<\/p><p> I will comment on the trickle down and how that will work.  The sector that is not traditionally funded can go back to being the commercial sector it is as soon as restrictions are lifted.  It is a thriving commercial sector.  The only reason it is not a thriving commercial sector now, temporarily, is because those involved cannot sell tickets, hold a festival or fill a field.  These include people who build the tents and the rigging lights and who hire the rigging lights.  They are part of the entire ecosystem that we put in with our submission, the iceberg.  The commercial sector has been stopped from commerce.  The arts and events sectors are not alone in that.<\/p><p> There was a question about local authorities.  We all have a superpower in the national campaign for the arts group.  Mr. O'Brien's superpower is local arts funding, so I will hand over to him for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602630000,"counter":545,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":546,"content":"<p>We cannot hear Mr. O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#G00300","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>He looks like he is making sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Given the technical interruptions we will move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#G00500","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I can answer part of the question, although I will not answer it as well as Mr. O'Brien.  There could be further investment from the Government either through the Creative Ireland programme or some other means.  It is worth saying that for 35 years the Arts Council and local arts authorities have had a partnership in funding arts activities.  There has been substantial local arts authority investment in local arts.  Committee members will be aware of that.  One element in the national campaign for the arts pre-budget submission was the principle that when money is raised for arts activity involving a local authority, it requires ring-fencing.

It has produced extraordinary dividends in a short time.  I recall in the worst part in lockdown some months ago something appearing on my Twitter timeline to the effect that in the rush back to normal we should decide which parts of normal are best worth rushing back to.  The funding now being made available to artistic endeavour in Ireland is a new normal and we are not going back to the old normal.  It is wonderful to see.  The pandemic seems to have focused our minds on those things that are most precious and most valuable to us as a people.  The arts sector is certainly one of those.<\/p> <p>  I have two quick observations more than questions, because the questions have been asked by many colleagues.  I have many friends in the music industry who have never had support from the Arts Council or the State.  They have thrived, succeeded and made a good life for themselves from music.  It has enabled them to pay mortgages and raise families.  They have done extraordinary work pursuing a life where they express themselves through their music.  The vast majority play gigs all over Ireland.  They do gigs for local arts festivals.  In the main, they do not receive any funding and never have.  We need to be especially careful in whatever support structures we put in place now.  We need to ensure they have the opportunity to be able to somehow tap into these.  We need to be careful to ensure there is no bureaucratic overload in accessing supports.  We need to ensure that there is, as someone has described, a trickle-down effect.  It is crucial to remain focused on that because thousands of musicians are sitting at home now unable to make a living.  I reckon it will be at least this time next year before anything resembling a normal living returns for them.<\/p> <p>  My final point is not unrelated.  Again, it has been raised consistently by colleagues this afternoon.  We need to ensure that we continue supporting artistic endeavour through our local authorities.  I have had the good fortune to know several of the arts officers in Galway City Council and Galway County Council.  They are deeply passionate about the promotion and nurturing of arts in their respective areas.  As a former local authority member and staff member, I know that in the past they have been acutely underfunded and unable to do the wonderful things they would like to do.  We need to ensure that perhaps in this new normal there is renewed focus on the substructure and the deep roots they put down in local communities throughout the country.  That ultimately allow us to nurture the artists of the future.

The challenge for us with regard to the pandemic unemployment payment is where people were on 13 March.  If we think of the events industry in Ireland and artists, arts workers and arts organisations, it is a gig economy but for a lot of people it is also a seasonal activity.  Many people who were working or starting to work in the events and festival industry were beginning around St. Patrick's Day and the season typically runs from March to November.  Then there are the rest of the arts activities, which are on every day of every month of every year.  The number who qualified for the pandemic unemployment payment at the very start and who said they worked in the arts was approximately 14,500.  Since the arts is a gig economy, these people might be professional artists, which means they make more than 50% of their income from their artistic endeavour, but because of the poverty most of our artists experience, due to the lack of support, they might have a second or third job.  There is a wider question of what chair people were on when the music stopped.  The original number on the pandemic unemployment payment was approximately 14,000 and a number of other people were on jobseeker's payments.  There were a number of others on the artist jobseeker's payment.  There were also people who did not qualify for the first round of the pandemic unemployment payment but then received it prior to 17 September.<\/p> <p>  All of this comes back to the fear we spoke about, regarding people being afraid to think about work and being frozen because they do not want to move off the support they are on now for fear there will not be other support.  At its height, approximately 14,000 people were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment but I am not sure what the current number is.  The actual number who identified as working in arts activities on the day would not give a real picture of how many artists, arts workers, events workers and organisations are in receipt of the payment.  Then there are a number of others who were supported through the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  Subsequently, during the stimulus, a number of arts organisations were able to get emergency funding to get them to the end of 2020.  The employment wage subsidy scheme being extended and more money going to the Arts Council will speak to two levels.  I am sorry to sound like a broken record but we keep coming back to the lived experience of the individual.  This is with regard to the pandemic unemployment payment being restored to &euro;350 and, perhaps, having a less blunt instrument than the pandemic unemployment payment down the line for those individuals.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted the Deputy asked about consumers.  They should buy more Irish books and music.  On Spotify Ireland we have a made in Ireland playlist that we update every Friday with new Irish music.  People should follow the links and buy people's records.  It would be amazing to do a buy Irish campaign.  I remember the one from when I was growing up in the 1980s.  I do it anyway since the pandemic.  I will only buy Irish food.  We are all making an effort to mind each other.  People should be aware of how hard it is for actors.  The Wexford Opera Festival is coming up and Druid is doing shows at present.  When there are events run digitally people should support them.  If there is a paywall, people should be aware that art is not free to make for the artist so it should not be free to consume for us at the other end.  Of course, all of this is said in the context that all of society is hurting.  Nobody is awash with money because of the pandemic.  Where and when people can, they should buy Irish and attend events.  They should still check the listings of their local art centres because they will have something on.  Look at what the National Gallery is doing online.  Look at what local galleries such as the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork and galleries in Kerry are doing.  There are gigs happening in Dingle.  They may not be happening in a bar but they might be happening on Facebook or online.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question on digital, an increase has been given to the Arts Council to the end of 2020 and it has a rolling fund until 9 November to help organisations pivot to digital.  Our organisations will be able to feed in our experiences.  Any organisation applying now to digitally pivot may not realise the further needs of digital until down the road.  I am sure there are other aspects of the economy that would benefit from having a digital fund available.  Our organisations were looking into building digital shops on a portal we already have.  It is not a big request for us as an organisation to ask the Arts Council but the 16,000 musicians on our website would not be able to find that increase.  I ask people to keep an eye on the digital funds that have already been made available, see what the pilots throw back and then perhaps support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Will the National Campaign for the Arts consider working alongside the Department and the Arts Council on putting in place an upskilling programme?

The arts are a particular gr&aacute; of mine, having spent some time in them before taking to the political stage.  It is great to have the witnesses here and to see a national recognition for the sector.  During the difficulties with Covid-19 there was a national awakening, as it were, to the value of the arts.  That was hard fought for and hard won.  I congratulate the national campaign and all the artists and others who were part of it.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to reflect on what Ms Dorgan said about the 50% of income.  A large number of people would have fallen through the cracks.  For many of us who worked in the arts, some 50% of our income came from bar work and cleaning even though we would have spent far more than 50% of our time working in the arts.  That brings me to my first question or point.  I have in mind the impact of Covid restrictions over the past while and over the next year on creative development and particularly the early years of people in the dramatic arts or in the creative sector.  There is something of a pause, but not a pause everywhere.  Does Ms Dorgan have thoughts on the impact Covid will have on the early years career, the play time and the time for development for young practitioners or young artists, and what can be done to deal with that?  We talk about flight from the sector, but I am worried about the people who are going to lose the entry level into the sector.  I met one of the best lighting technicians I know when she was studying engineering in college.  She got involved in it as a side project and went on to study lighting engineering.  There is a group of people who, over the next year or so, are potentially going to be lost to that state of play or that entry into the arts world.  Has Ms Dorgan any thoughts on that and what can be done about it?  That flourishing state of play is important for people in the early years of beginning their careers in the arts.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to cross-pollination for the arts sector.  I would have started the morning in Blackpool teaching children art and theatre, in the afternoon I was doing costumes for a show in the Cork Arts Theatre and in the evening I was in the Granary Theatre doing lighting.  That cross-pollination for people in their early careers in the arts is very important for development and flourishing.  Does Ms Dorgan have any thoughts on how that will be dealt with over the next year?  There is plenty of stuff online and practitioners are doing everything they can, but I am very concerned about the loss of the early years engagement.  When people are trying to find their way in their arts careers they do not know exactly what they are doing so they are trying out everything.  There is that cross-pollination between different jobs and the issue of how that will happen in the future.<\/p> <p>  Finally, somebody raised with me the requirement for proof of artistic credentials.  This was before the onset of Covid, but it is still relevant.  Continuing to have her studio space was put under threat and because she did not have a website she could not prove she was a bona fide artist, even though she had had the studio for 20 years.  There was a change in requirements regarding funding and an expansion of proof to prove what type of artist one is.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on that?  Fortunately, there is a boon in funding at present, but this onerous requirement to prove oneself as an artist might tie into what an outside perspective of an artist is without necessarily tying into what an artist does.  That is a slightly complicated question, somewhat blue-sky thinking, but it arose before the onset of Covid and I suspect it will become more problematic as people are competing for funding.  How does one prove oneself as an artist?  This requirement to meet certain needs does not necessarily always tie into the way artists live or do things.<\/p> <p>  Those are my three questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#J00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>If Cian O'Brien's microphone is working, I will put the early arts activity question to him.

The Senator is right that one of the things that is so important for people at the beginning of their careers is how they form themselves.  Artists get better by practice and it is essential that people have that experience.  What is greatly beneficial is that the Arts Council has put additional resources into things such as bursaries and commissions for artists, which is exactly where they can hone their craft.  There is going to be a challenge for people in how they will interact with each other and how they will develop relationships with other artists and collaborators.  The pandemic creates that challenge.  However, I always think that artists find a way.  They are amazing at finding ways to collaborate with other artists.  As a result of the increases in funding, one will see people finding ways to collaborate with one another because they will have the resources.  Should they be successful in applications they might make, they will have the resources to do that.  That might happen online, but the current level 3 still allows artists to work in their studios or workplaces.  People are still able to be in spaces together, albeit safely.  I share the Senator's concerns, but the benefits that are coming our way will go some way towards addressing some of the concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>On the second issue, credentials are a broad field.  There are different requirements depending on where one is accessing and from whom.  It is a track record for Arts Council bursaries.  Most bursaries are designed for professional artists.  While there are other ways that funding and support can get to a person for amateur activity, most bursaries and larger direct funds to artists are for professional artists.  It becomes easier because one can demonstrate.  Each sector has its own pins, as it were, of professional flagpoles.  The music industry has those - it is when one does this or that and it is the same with acting and dancing.  Each sector has its own credential-building criteria.  In those sectors that do not, we bump up against each other enough.  The arts is not one thing; it is a fluid sector.  One can be a dancer, a graphic designer and an actor.  Liv O'Donoghue is one such example as an artist.  One can also be a volunteer in a national organisation as well, and it eats up one's time.<\/p> <p>  There are enough professional development flagpoles in place.  The sector is incredibly robust in that regard.  It is also incredibly robust and a leader in many other things, including making this pandemic safe and making interactivity safe.  I attended a meeting the other day at which a Department of Health official was able to offer an analysis about a particular place, which I will not name.  The Department was able to say that no Covid-19 cases had come from that cultural institution.  When we get used to Covid - I refer to Deputy Mattie McGrath's question as well on where is the fair and unfair - and we get better at dealing with it and pass the panic stage of this pandemic, it will be easier to start opening up more places as workplaces and for access.  However, I am digressing a little.<\/p> <p>  The sector has professional development moments in most disciplines.  If they are not in one's discipline and if it is a new discipline, there will be an organisation, whether it is a resource organisation or an arts activity in one's locality, that one will be able to lean on for that information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Dorgan and compliment her on the campaign.  I am the Fine Gael spokesperson for the arts in the Seanad.  It is important that we recognise both the Government and the Minister for the support they have given the industry.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of months, I missed my regular diet of performances by our local musical society.  We have a fantastic stage school in Longford, namely, the Evolution Stage School.  It puts on fantastic shows.  We have a school of rock, which is an excellent school for young children from various backgrounds and does tremendous work.  It is important that this funding was put in place so that they can continue to work in that sector.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I wanted to ask have already been posed so I will hone in on only a couple of points.  Ms Dorgan alluded to the fact that theatres - we have our own Backstage Theatre in Longford - are ticketed venues.  NPHET needs to look at the possibility of making exceptions for them where it can be managed properly, we can achieve social distancing and get people back into the theatres, especially where they are ticketed.  That is something that needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  Coming up to Christmas, the usual pantomimes that have been part of the diet of all young children over the years will probably be missing.  Reference has been made to online productions.  It would be nice to see these happening for the Christmas if funding was put in place.  I do not know whether that can be done under any of these schemes or whether funding could be made available to national schools across the country in order that the children could have their Christmas parties.  The reality is that they will not be going to such parties this year.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Dorgan for the work that she does for the industry.  I am delighted that it was supported.

I agree 100% that galleries, theatres and cinemas are safe places where social distancing can be adhered to.  At the meeting the Minister arranged for us with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, representatives from his Department and the then acting CMO, we were able to make that case.  The worry was congregation before and after.  The arts sector, as I alluded to earlier, responded quickly and early to the restriction of 50 and what it could do.  Everybody pivoted in the context of ticketing systems.  Nobody could buy more than four tickets in one go.  People sit in pods when they arrive or they sit apart in a theatre.  Coming into the winter, it will be difficult for us, as a nation, anyway.  Where we can start to open up and start to get out there and experience that art in person again, then the position in respect of cinemas, galleries and theatres can and should be re-examined repeatedly.  We need to give ourselves permission to change our minds.  What we said last week might be the same as what is being said this week.  If, however, this week's decision makes it a little easier because we have listened to a particular idea, then we should forgive ourselves for that politically and in the context of our sector.  We need to be able to change our minds on matters like that.  Those areas that the Senator has talked about are safe already.  They could be safer or deemed to be safe in level 3 as much as they are in level 2.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the Minister and the Department have been incredibly supportive right throughout the crisis, as have all three parties in government.  Everyone involved has been incredibly reactive to us, as a sector.  I suppose yesterday's budget had a certain feel about it, not only in the context of the &euro;50 million for events, the &euro;130 million for the Arts Council and the &euro;3 for Creative Ireland but also with regard to the various decisions made.  I referred to this earlier.  I cannot over-egg the pudding when speaking to all the people in this room about their contributions or when I refer how those in the sector felt when seeing the Taoiseach talk about the arts in the way he did last night and realise that he gets it and to see the Minister getting her colleagues in government onto the same page.  As I am listening to the members, it sounds as if there was open door for each and every last one of them.  I do not think there is a citizen who does not agree that the arts are really important.  That is great.  I agree with Deputy Cannon that it took a pandemic for us to all realise just how important the sector is.  It is also important to allow ourselves to revisit those activities in society that are actually safe, if we can start to say that cases are going in a particular direction and ask whether we can be a little more open in certain areas.<\/p> <p>  Senator Carrigy is correct about cinemas, pantomimes and galleries.  Some of the events funding is aimed encouraging those involved with pantomimes to come up with innovative ideas, maybe as a seat subsidy for a pantomime to go ahead and for the production company to still pay its actors, musicians, lighting crew and event staff.  It is, perhaps, an acknowledgement that this was previously a commercial endeavour and that parts of what these people have to do deliver a show may have to be subsidised.  I think that is what the events budget in the Department is for.  I do not know, in terms of levels 3 and 4, if pantomimes can go ahead.  If we are re-examining those places where social distancing can be adhered to and where people would be congregating on the way to a show, for example, outside the theatre, then we are aware from our conversations with NPHET that this is where the concerns lie.  There is not a challenge that has not been met or tried to be met by the sector.  Given time, we may solve more of those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020101400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank Ms Dorgan and her esteemed colleagues, Mr. O'Brien and Ms O'Donoghue, for attending.

This is a mainly Irish-owned SME business sector, with many high street shops in rural and regional towns, as well as concentrations in the larger cities.  The industry is regulated by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, offering additional financial and consumer protection for those booking travel services via a travel agent.  Turnover across the sector was approximately &euro;1.4 billion per annum, and the ITAA is the representative body for the industry.  Travel agents serve both the corporate and leisure markets with the full range of outbound travel services.<\/p> <p>  The ITAA is deeply concerned about the impact the Covid-19 crisis is having on the wider travel sector and Irish travel agents.  The travel industry is unique because of the following factors.  First, trading is down 90% to 95% since March and will continue at that level of trading for the foreseeable future because of the messaging on non-essential travel.  Second, travel companies have had to remain open to service customers with cancellations, refunds and rebooking.  The companies could not close, even though they were effectively blocked from trading, and they have had to continue to carry a proportion of salary and all overhead costs.  Third, travel agents have had to engage in negative trading due to the refund requirement on business that was secured in 2019 and early 2020.  Fourth, the industry expectation was a resumption after six months but we currently have no reopening date.  We require a compensation package to partially cover running costs, and we need infrastructure to be put in place to allow international travel to recommence that complies with health guidelines and keeps passengers safe.  Fifth, travel agents are the only industry sector in Ireland that is both regulated, through our licence, and bonded for consumer protection.<\/p> <p>  The ITAA welcomed the publication of the aviation recovery task force report in July and the recommendations within.  However, although the association had anticipated the interim recommendations of the task force would be implemented by the Government following their publication on 22 June, this has not been done.  We need Government adoption of the EU traffic light system and we need Ireland to follow the rest of the EU with the implementation of that system.  The task force emphasises the urgency of a plan &ldquo;to economically co-exist with the virus and, as an island nation, this has to include international travel.&rdquo;  The ITAA reiterates the urgency of this and the need to follow fellow member states with a safety-conscious reopening of international travel.<\/p> <p>  While much ITAA business relates to outbound travel, the nature of the aviation sector means that the outbound and inbound sectors are inherently linked.  The ITAA supports the promotion of aviation and regional airports to save Ireland's tourism sector and, by extension, its economy.  Travel agents, as the vital element in outbound travel, will do our utmost to contribute to promoting foreign travel, and our role in promoting outbound travel complements the efforts of others to promote inward travel.<\/p><p> Regarding the proposed EU traffic light system, the ITAA welcomes that the Government has committed to EU-wide rules for such a system aimed at opening our skies.  Most EU airports are operating safely with additional structural supports, and the ITAA is of the opinion that the Irish airports should be permitted to follow suit with our neighbouring EU airports.<\/p><p> As for Covid testing, the safety and comfort of our customers are paramount to all member agents.  We have called for the development and implementation of routine Covid-19 testing for passengers boarding flights out of the country as this will ensure a \"clean\" environment throughout the travel process.  Evidence has shown that this significantly reduces the spread of the illness.  The ITAA believes that this testing will help rebuild consumer confidence in travel.

I have provided a brief opening statement to the committee.  I should note at the outset that I have no direct involvement whatsoever in the aviation sector.  My background is in software engineering and entrepreneurship.<\/p> <p>  I was contacted by the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Shane Ross, in early June asking whether I would consider acting as a neutral chairman, from outside of the aviation sector, of the aviation task force which he was putting together.  Having reflected, I agreed to do so.  He emphasised to me the urgency with which we should undertake our work and the speed at which we should come up with our recommendations.  The members of the task force were invited by the former Minister.  I had no involvement in putting the task force together.  Some of my colleagues on the task force, I believe, have already spoken to the committee, and perhaps in the future further members will do so.  I do not know the committee's agenda.<\/p> <p>  We had four meetings in early June and mid-June and finished on 3 July.  We produced an interim report after two weeks and a final report after a further two weeks.  Our work was very intense.  We worked with the secretariat over weekends to produce our recommendations.  I hope Deputies and Senators have had an opportunity to read our reports, in particular the final report, and look at our recommendations, which I will not repeat here.  We then presented our reflections to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on 10 July and subsequently to a broader audience, including the secretary to the Government, in late July.  The task force has not met since that last meeting and in effect has ceased its work.<\/p> <p>  My only comment as somebody from outside of the sector working with young start-ups is how important aviation is to us as an economy and a small nation on the periphery of Europe.  A certain amount can be done by virtual calls such as this, on Zoom, GoToMeeting and so on, but for new business development it is virtually impossible to win new customers, raise international finance, hire new international staff and develop new partnerships with virtual conference calls alone.  Face-to-face meetings are important.  Business, after all, is done between people, not between companies, and in establishing new business relationships one needs that personal contact.  I think it is extremely difficult and frustrating for indigenous companies based in Ireland with export markets that their competitors overseas are able to travel more freely than we are in this country at this point.  That places further stress on the high-potential technology start-up sector.<\/p> <p>  With that, I thank the committee and the Chairman again for the invitation.  I would be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020101400002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Horn"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Horn.

In the context of the presentations we have heard this morning and the precariousness of travel, how would he see us as a committee working with the Government, first, to ensure we have adequate testing and, second, to restore confidence among the travelling public, notwithstanding his remarks on new business development and new and existing customers?

I myself have been in contact with a number of travel agents who have expressed to me a number of issues with engagement with airlines.

What specifically should we on this committee be pushing in respect of the task force?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the European Council directive this Monday, there seems to be ambiguity again around travel in respect of the green, amber and red lights.  What is the witnesses' perspective on this?<\/p> <p>  I refer to yesterday's budget.

We had the green list and there were four countries on it, two of which have no airports.  Then we suddenly opened up to ten and 12 countries and there was silence about that.  We felt that the Government was not interested in pursuing the green list.  Otherwise, it would have spoken about the ten or 12 countries that were to open up.

It is good to have this engagement.  I hope it will be ongoing because although their sectors are being supported through this crisis, their troubles have not ended.  I am sure they will articulate that strongly.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by addressing Dr. Horn.  When I spoke in the D&aacute;il on 3 June last, I asked the then Minister, Shane Ross, to introduce an aviation task force.  I am glad that he and his Department initiated that and that Dr. Horn chaired that effort.  There were certainly some positives in it.  I had some difficulties with the constitution of the task force.  That was not of Dr. Horn's doing.  I felt that there were certain omissions.  For example, the workers were not adequately represented on the task force.  Many issues transpired in that regard.  In particular, the Aer Lingus and Ryanair workers, and indeed the workers in Shannon Airport who faced 20% pay cuts, felt that their only representation was that from their unions, whereas senior management had another layer of engagement in the form of the task force and direct access to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear Dr. Horn's opinions on some of the shortcomings with the task force.  It looked at getting aeroplanes back in the sky.  I suppose that is where aviation has to restart.  There is neither an aviation sector nor a travel and tourism sector unless there are flights in and out of Ireland.  One of the shortcomings was that the task force did not address the gross imbalances we have in Irish aviation.  Last year, in a normal trading year, 32.7 million people came in and out of Dublin Airport and 1.6 million people came through Shannon Airport.  In the second quarter of this year, 155,000 people came through Dublin Airport and just 120 passengers came through Shannon Airport.  That is a significant imbalance.  It was there last year.  It is there this year.  It is more augmented this year.  The task force did not adequately look at it.<\/p> <p>  Another shortcoming related to all the stakeholders here that have looked at re-engaging the routes into Europe.  I welcome what happened yesterday with the European Commission and the traffic light system.  We will not see an immediate return from it but we will see the airlines being able to plan their routes for the remainder of this year and the spring season.  I hope that will benefit the tourism sector as well.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear Dr. Horn's views on how we re-establish flights to the US in a meaningful way bearing in mind its R-level is way above ours.  I would like him to reflect on that.  Dr. Horn might briefly speak on the imbalances also.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Hackett and Mr. Dawson from the travel agency sector.  Given everything in the July stimulus, which is behind us, and in yesterday's budget, and the stimuli that have come in again for businesses and tourism, what more needs to be done between now and early spring?  Everyone talks about tourism starting on St. Patrick's Day.  What more needs to happen between now and then for the various sectors?  We might hear from Dr. Horn first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020101400002#C00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his initiative on 3 June in pressing the former Minister to establish a task force.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions was represented directly on the task force by invitation from the Minister and was fully participative.  In addition, we issued an invitation to all interested parties to make written submissions to us and we received 26 such written submissions.  All of these, by the way, were published on the Department's website at the time.  As the Deputy stated, I personally had no involvement in the constitution of the task force.<\/p> <p>  I note the imbalance between Dublin Airport and the regional airports.  It has been an historical issue in the country.  As chairman, I felt that my role was to try to achieve consensus across the task force.  Therefore, I did not want any recommendation in the task force recommendations that would not be supported by every member of the task force and so the recommendations were by consensus.  There were differences of opinion, as one would naturally expect.  Where there were differences and not consensus, we were unable to produce recommendations in that respect.<\/p> <p>  Flights to and from the United States are absolutely critical for the business sector, and particularly the indigenous business sector.  It is incredibly frustrating that the restrictions, at least the recommendations from the Government, are no-fly and essential travel only.  That makes it difficult for senior managers and leadership in young companies to ask their own teams and staff to travel when the Government recommendation is not to fly and essential travel only.  The lack of connectivity and ability to fly to the United States right now is hurting the high-technology indigenous sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020101400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Horn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I will talk about the regional airports from the point of view of the imbalance.

The airline using some of the legislation that covers this area most is Ryanair.

The difficulty there is it is almost conflicting with the package travel directive, which provides consumer protection and asks the travel agent to refund the consumer.  We have a loggerhead-type situation going on with those two pieces of EU legislation.

I suggest that, rather than going back over the work it has done, the next element of task force's work would look at how we ensure a balanced development and regional aspect to the aviation recovery.  Building on what Dr. Horn has already done, the task force could look at the next phase and how we ensure that as aviation activity recovers - and it will but it will take some time - we do not end up with the airlines concentrating on one airport, namely, Dublin Airport, and effectively eliminating all others.

It is ultimately a non-competitive environment because frankly, Shannon Airport, as an independent albeit State-owned entity, finds it extraordinarily difficult to compete with the financial might and strength of Dublin Airport, even in good times.  The real concern now is that the airlines, working from a very low base, will try to limit a duplication of their activities to the greatest extent possible, and that can only play negatively for other airports.  We will have to revisit our entire aviation policy.

I welcome our witnesses and thank them for taking the time because this meeting is informative for us.  I have met representatives of the Irish Travel Agents Association on a number of occasions and I know many people involved in the industry.  Most of the businesses are family run, professional, courteous, organised and provide an excellent service.  I understand there are 190 licensed travel agents in the country and I have met many of them in my constituency of Tipperary on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>  What is effectively happening is that the Government's advice is not to travel and thousands of people have followed that advice and cancelled flights and holidays.  Most of those cancellations are package holidays which would include flights, transfers and accommodation.  A ludicrous situation exists under this European Union directive whereby the travel agent is legally responsible to secure the refund of the entire package.  That is simply not financially sustainable and I ask Mr. Hackett or Mr. Dawson to explain why that is the case because the consumer needs to understand.  Travel agents are suffering incredible abuse from clients who think that all the travel agent has to do is reach into a bank account and refund the money.  As I understand it, and the consumer does not understand this, the travel agent is lucky to get 10% of the entire package.  How can travel agents refund 100% when they only receive 10%?  It is a total nonsense and travesty.  It is incredibly unfair to expect travel agents to shoulder the burden of that financial outlay.  I have been told by several travel agents that the reality is they will be forced into liquidation.  As has previously been confirmed, the bonding system to protect the consumer when agencies collapse only becomes effective after a travel agent goes into liquidation, which is another nonsense.<\/p> <p>  Travel agents and thousands of consumers throughout Ireland are effectively caught stranded between the European Union directive and Government advice.  It has been crystal clear to us here and it was extraordinary to hear the comment that it is cheaper to fly an almost empty aeroplane than to cancel a flight and refund the consumers.<\/p> <p>  We have identified the amount today, but will our guests explain how the system operates and why it is impossible for them to give these refunds, for the benefit of the consumers who are listening and the clients our guests represent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020101400002#F00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I will do that.

Nobody mentioned them yesterday, which was disappointing considering we have met Ministers who have had positive attitudes towards us.  Kindness is no good when it comes to keeping our doors open.<\/p> <p>  A booking through a travel agent falls under the package travel directive, a piece of EU legislation under which the travel agent is made responsible from start to finish.  If the package is cancelled or does not happen because of a pandemic or a world war, no matter what happens, the legislation states that the travel agent is supposed to pay a refund within 14 days whether or not it receives the money back from the airline or hotel involved.  It is crazy stuff.<\/p> <p>  We are members, and I am on the board, of the European Travel Agents' and Tour Operators' Association, ECTAA.  There are moves afoot to change that legislation.  As Deputy Lowry has said, the implications of that directive could close a business tomorrow morning.  We must fight with our suppliers to get the money back.  At the same time, the consumer is banging the door down and demanding money because the legislation insists that the travel agent pays back the money.  Our staff throughout the country, the 3,500 people employed in the industry, have a banging on both sides of their heads as they try to look for money.

Holidays have moved from being charter holidays to being part of a scheduled operation.  The money comes in from the consumer to the travel agent and goes straight to the airline and then, when something like a cancellation happens, the money has to work its way back and that is the challenge.  When the industry was charter-based, the money was effectively sitting in one's house so it was easy to give refunds.  The package travel directive was designed at a different period of time and the industry has moved on.

I get the challenges.<\/p> <p>  Our guests mentioned that the worst offender for not paying back money is Ryanair.  Are any other airlines doing that?<\/p> <p>  I want to deal specifically with an example that came to me from a travel agent who dealt in an awful lot of group bookings.  He would buy flights at different prices in different batches.  Some of them were for school kids in school group holiday scenarios and that created a difficulty because there could be a large disparity between the prices and the problem was how to separate it out.

Screen scraping means that we are using data from the airlines' website to offer flights.  It is a feed, like a dotcom website, and it is a public website.  For us to sell holidays using Ryanair or Aer Lingus flights, we either have feeds which are official or they are screen scraping, which is effectively taking the data.  Ryanair has a particular issue with that which is to do with its own distribution policies and the terms and conditions of its website.  It is entitled to set those and there is no question about that.  Screen scraping in itself is not inherently damaging to the consumer. Effectively, what we are trying to do is to provide the consumer with the holiday and flights that he or she wants to book.  Ryanair is very happy to accept the money.

In a group situation one may have a group booking with 20, 30 or 40 unknown individuals.  They could be all different couples going on an escorted tour or, in the case quoted by the Deputy, they could be in a school group.  It would not be feasible to return the money to one passenger in the school group.  In the first instance, the person may be underage or a minor.  How could this happen?  This would not be the case.  The school group has come to the travel agent, has handed over a deposit, has asked for a tour to be booked for education purposes to whatever destination and has put everything together.  That has been done.  The airline is trying to manoeuvre the scenario to say that it has to refund directly back to the passenger.  It does not work in that situation.  Groups are one example in which this does not work and there are many other examples.  It does not work in the corporate travel sector where a company will have used the company credit card to pay for a flight for an individual to travel to a destination and not that of the individual passenger who is travelling to the destination.<\/p> <p>  There are many reasons, and what is unfortunate is that up to the time of this pandemic, there was precedent for all of the refunds to go back through the travel agent.

It became apparent to me that it is very regulated, there is great safety for people booking through travel agents, and many people get comfort from that.  The staff engaged in that business are very experienced and offer that level of service and comfort.<\/p> <p>  What was stressed to me in those meetings was that the emergency Covid-19 payments were very important in retaining the staff who had been with the agents for a very long time.

The last thing that people in this business who are struggling need is further uncertainty.  They need certainty because the business model they have is viable but vulnerable.  One of the benchmarks that we need to use for Covid-19 emergency payments is that these businesses that need assistance and get it during this time will be viable once they come out of the pandemic.  This is really important.<\/p> <p>  We had representatives of the airlines before the committee last week, and not one single person asked about ghost flights.  I find it incredible and unacceptable that a large, well-funded and resourced business like that would engage in running ghost flights in order not to have to pay refunds.

I do not know if the witnesses are aware of the report Limerick Chamber published last year, which considered this question and looked at other countries that are grappling with this question.  A good case in point is Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands, which is ultra-dominant.  The Dutch Government introduced a cap on Schiphol to give other airports a chance.  Why did the report not look at that particular measure and does the task force have a view on that?  What is the view of the task force on a post-Covid-19 era?  Should we endorse a policy of balanced regional development to give other airports such as Shannon Airport an opportunity to grow, develop and be sustainable?

We will then follow up with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the airlines.  We would very much welcome it if the Commission for Aviation Regulation was put back <i>in<\/i>and we strongly recommend that Dr. Horn take the helm there and report back.  As a committee, we will look at what should be terms of reference.  Our first item of work will be when the Minister appears before the committee next week to discuss the Estimates and we will raise testing issues.  Immediately after the mid-term recess, our first item of business will be public meetings about testing.  If members agree to that, that is the area we will discuss.<\/p><p>The industry directly employs 140,000 people.  We are an island nation and Dr. Horn referred to the impact on business.  We want to work within public health guidelines.  Covid is with us for the immediate future and we must find a way to operate.  In keeping with what Deputy Carey and others have suggested, we should bring in expertise including NPHET and representatives of international airports that have good testing in place.  There is no reason that, with virtual conferencing now, we cannot do it.  Dr. Horn might correspond with the committee as to what he believes is needed in the terms of reference for a new aviation commission.  We take his points on the new aviation policy but that is long term.  There are immediate issues with Covid.  We would welcome him corresponding with us as a committee and giving a general outline of what he thinks should be the terms of reference of any new, reformed commission for aviation regulation.<\/p><p>The next meeting of the committee will be a private, virtual meeting at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 October 2020, where we will consider all the items that have not been discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020101400002#L02400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602630000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 1.20 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
