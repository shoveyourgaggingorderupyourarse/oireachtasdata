This week's correspondence is mostly from members of the committee and was dealt with last week when we considered the work programme.  I have flagged No. R0149 for further consideration.  This is a later dated 8 October on the issue of bogus self-employment.  The previous committee considered correspondence regarding the matter raised and decided not to take the matter further in light of the fact that various State organisations have already dealt with it.  The correspondent was advised of these outcomes.  We agreed last week that we would include the issue of bogus self-employment on our work programme as part of our engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We advised the correspondent accordingly.  We have set out this course of action, but I do not think we should rule out inviting the correspondent to appear before the committee to deal with that issue again.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The witness has previously been before the Committee of Public Accounts and seems to have imparted a lot of information regarding alleged bogus self-employment.  It might be worthwhile for the committee to have the opportunity to hear what he has to say.

A couple of months have elapsed but it is good to look at the state of affairs.  I thank the Chairman for organising this meeting.  Let me first congratulate Ireland on its new EU Commissioner, Ms Mairead McGuinness, and I congratulate her on her success.<\/p> <p>  I am very happy to have my Portuguese friend and colleague with me because for us it is very important to closely co-operate with our Portuguese and Slovenian friends as a trio for the Presidency.  I am sure that we will have a chance to discuss the trio programme a bit later.<\/p> <p>  After one to two years of thorough preparation, obviously the Covid-19 pandemic has considerably impacted our Presidency preparations and the motto we chose for the Presidency is: Together for Europe's Recovery.  We chose it because what we will need to manage this crisis is solidarity, a willingness to compromise, pragmatism and co-operation.  The guiding principles of our programme and Presidency are that we really try to permanently overcome the Covid-19 pandemic and have an economic recovery.  We want a stronger and more innovative Europe; a fair and sustainable Europe; and a Europe of security and common values, which is also a strong Europe in the world.<\/p> <p>   Our foreign Minister said, at the start of the Presidency, that we want to be a driving force and a facilitator in building bridges to jointly make progress in this endeavour.  We know that the German Presidency faces very high expectations.  We are ambitious.  We want to work in unity and solidarity in the remaining months as we did since July.  At the same time we must remain realistic about what we can achieve in the remaining six months of this Presidency.  We are focusing on nine priorities but due to time constraints concerning opening statements I will briefly talk about a few of them. <\/p> <p>  Overcoming the pandemic is central and managing the economic recovery takes centre stage.  Agreeing on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the next generation EU, that is the recovery fund, is very important for us.  The German Chancellor, Mrs. Merkel, has often said that extraordinary situations needs extraordinary measures.  We want to make sure that this happens and that the money can flow by 2021 so we are working very hard to reach an agreement with the European Parliament.  So far, about seven meetings at political level have taken place.  Our aim is to finalise the procedures as soon as possible.  Also, we want to improve co-ordination within the EU and I am sure that the members have seen the recent developments there.  <\/p> <p>  The next big issue, which is very important to Ireland, is concluding the negotiations on a future relationship with the United Kingdom.  Yesterday, the Chancellor spoke at the EU Committee of the Regions where she again stressed the agreement is in everyone's interest, that the EU remains united in the fight for that agreement but that we also have to be prepared for a no-deal outcome.<\/p><p>She stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe want an agreement: from the Irish point of view in particular it is extremely important. We won't let Ireland down but will continue to stick together in these negotiations.  But we have to bear in mind the realities because an agreement has to be in the interests of both sides, in the British interest and in the interest of the EU's 27 member states. <\/blockquote><p>Our Minister for Foreign Affairs most recently warned against a failure of the negotiations calling a no-deal outcome completely irresponsible and underlining that we want a close and ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom.  Yesterday, Michel Barnier briefed the General Affairs Council on that and he will brief the European Council tomorrow and the day after.  Unity remains important to us and we will keep negotiating.  As members may know, Ursula von der Leyen will speak to Boris Johnson by telephone this afternoon.  We will keep the process going but significant difficulties remain.  Talks are at a critical stage, as our Minister of State for Europe also underlined.  I will happy to discuss that in greater detail later. <br\/><br\/>I will briefly touch on a few more issues that are priorities for the German Presidency.  On migration and asylum policy, yesterday the Chancellor said that we want to move forward.  She spoke of our &quot;humanitarian duty&quot; with regard to what happened in the Moria camp.  She believes it is a burden on Europe that agreement has not yet been reached and stated the Commission's proposal was well worthy of discussion.  A compromise is needed, she said, and each member state will have to contribute to a fair solution.  The debate has started between the member states based on the Commission proposal for a new pact on migration and asylum.  We hope we can make progress and agree on that. <br\/><br\/>The next very important issue to Germany is the rule of law.  We believe Europe should be at the forefront on climate protection and digitisation.  Germany supports the aim of a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.  We want to work on producing climate legislation within a year.  Other topics are digitisation, Europe's role in the world and the relationship with Africa, which will also be discussed at the European Council this week.<br\/><br\/>For us, it is very important that citizens are on board.  That is why we pay great attention to having a conference on the future of Europe.  We would love to see that conference kick-started during our Presidency but we will have to see whether the pandemic will allow us to do so.  As the Chancellor said, this is an excellent opportunity to talk to our citizens about what they wish to happen in the future and how we can reach that aim.  We would like it to be a wide-ranging debate on our joint future in Europe.  With that, I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The first meetings between the two committees on European affairs showed that both sides are interested in dialogue.<\/p><p>That will allow an exchange of views and, more than that, of experience, and the opportunity for each side to present to the other one the specificities that exist on each side.<\/p><p> We hope that there will be an agreement with the UK.  Like Germany and Ireland, we are very committed to finding a balanced agreement with the UK.  I remind the committee that we are the oldest standing alliance between the UK and another country.  The Anglo-Portuguese alliance dates from the 14th century.  That is something that has lasted but has had its ups and downs.  The United Kingdom is one of our major investors and we have a large community of British people living in Portugal, so it is in our interest to have a close relationship and partnership, but as my German colleague said, in the end there must be a fair agreement and the Irish question must not be sacrificed on the altar of an agreement.  Since the very beginning, we shared the Irish concerns and that will continue.<\/p><p> Regarding the Presidency, I will be brief because now the system is that we have a trio of Presidencies.  Slovenia, Portugal and Germany established a working programme for 18 months.  It will be the second half of this year and the two semesters of next year.  We identified a set of priorities which mirror a common vision for Europe.  As usual, this programme is a general framework, a document that is established in broad lines and is being adapted, but there is more consensus than usual currently.  I know that today my Minister will meet with his counterparts in the Portuguese Parliament to brief them on the progress that is being made and how that reflects on our Presidency.  There is very intense dialogue between our government, our Minister for European affairs and our foreign Minister regarding the programme for the Presidency we are preparing, but now we have more question marks.  We have a programme but we have a lot of question marks and, as usual, we are waiting to see what happens in the Presidency and after December.  I am ready to come next year - I hope it will be on a more sound ground - to tell the committee what our semester will look like.<\/p><p> The stage belongs completely to Germany now and Portugal is strongly supporting it because its success is our success and, as members can see, our priorities are very similar.  They are in line and complete each other.  Given that, I can state that the future Portuguese Presidency of the EU has established as the main priority for its semester to reinforce the resilience of Europe and to restore our citizens' confidence in the European social model, based on the promotion of a Union that is solidly anchored on shared values of solidarity, convergence and cohesion.  Our action plan is structured around several pillars: a Europe of resilience and solidarity that is prepared to face future crises and the reinforcement of investment and the economic recovery will be at the core of our action.<\/p><p>The German Presidency is developing excellent work on this, and preparing the instruments.  Afterwards, we will deal with implementation and ensure that all of the innovative instruments that are needed for a successful European recovery and the reinforcement of European resilience are urgently implemented.  We will be preparing conditions to promote all the initiatives aimed at mitigating the crisis impacts and to ensure a successful development of the plans for economic recovery, to promote growth and employment and to anchor the recovery on the European climate pact and digital transition.<\/p><p> The reinforcement of European solidarity and European shared values will be another requirement to ensure balanced European construction.  We are talking about the reinforcement of democracy and the rule of law, the promotion of human rights and fundamental liberties and the improvement of the European response to emergency situations such as the ones we are facing.<\/p><p> Social Europe will be one of our main priorities.  The development of a stronger social Europe in our economic recovery trajectory will be at the heart of the future programme of the Portuguese Presidency, which believes that in a difficult environment such as the one caused by the pandemic, it is more important than ever to reinforce the European social model as the motor for growth and to ensure that social rights are perceived by citizens as a palpable reality, a benefit deriving from Europe.  We are always talking about the fact that Europe must reach out to its citizens.  If they have palpable proof that it acts positively in their everyday life that will help to solidify our common project.  It will entail several actions on a wide range of issues, ranging from mechanisms for the mitigation of unemployment impacts on professional formation and learning, and responding to the social impacts resulting from energy and digital transition because this crisis came at a moment when we were already seeing that the whole world was in a phase of transition and that we needed to ensure that all citizens are on board.  That is even more so the case since the crisis.  The situation has become more complex and we must look into it.  There are also demographic challenges.  A very important point that is complementary with the others is the fight against poverty and social exclusion given that now, in this transition phase, the risk of that happening has increased.<\/p><p> A green Europe and the pursuit of economic recovery on a sustainable basis is our second priority.  We have our green transition.  The other day, President von der Leyen had very nice words for the changes we made.  We were very committed to decarbonise our economy and to develop renewables and clean energy and we are quite advanced in that regard.  We are to the forefront in Europe and that is one area in our bilateral relations where we have lots of scope for talk and co-operation.  We need to improve our capability to adapt to the effects of climate change and promote the benefits of being carbon free and having a resilient economic model.  Other measures in that regard include the promotion of the European climate pact, the adaptation to climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, the improvement of forests, water and waste management, to conclude CAP reform, and to promote innovation and digitalisation in the rural world, as well as the sustainable management of natural resources.<\/p><p>This work has been started by the German Presidency and we will follow this work to which we will make our input and contribution.<\/p><p> For a country such as Portugal, which faces the sea, the committee will not be surprised to learn that the development of the blue economy is also a matter we hold close to our heart.  This year, we were supposed to welcome the United Nations Ocean Conference but it had to be postponed.  We hope it can take place next year and that not only will it be a major political event but it will also gather the environmental organisations that are active on the oceans as well as businesses at the side events.<\/p><p> I mentioned already a digital Europe because it is everywhere and will be important internally and externally.  It will also be an important part of our partnership with Africa because we have to enable African countries to manage their own development if we are creating a partnership.  I will provide more detail on that later if members want.<\/p><p> On a global Europe, our vision is similar to the one my German colleague expressed.  Africa is important.  We are committed to creating a true partnership.  A summit was due to take place on this but we do not know now when it will take place.  Otherwise, we hope it can be done during Portugal's Presidency of the EU.  It was established that we would have a business and technological forum so that we can put those worlds in contact with each other and that directly forms co-operation in a sense.  The meeting with India will also be important.  There is supposed to be a meeting between the Indian Prime Minister and the European Council, which we hope will take place.  There are lots of other events and international meetings that now have a big question mark over them.<\/p><p> I mention the political neighbourhood, the eastern partnership and the relationship with Asia, mainly China.  This will be important, as will the relationship with Latin America, where we have a historical presence and of which we have knowledge.  We are keen to bring the two continents closer.  We also want to ensure we have a voice in international forums, namely, human rights forums and other forums that are close to the core of our values.  That is where we can defend and promote those values and our economic interests.  The World Trade Organization is one such forum..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

There is an awful lot to cover and I have a million questions.  Thankfully, Senator Chambers has asked a few of those questions so I will not repeat her excellent points.<\/p> <p>  Both of our guests mentioned Europe's place in the world.  Mr. de Almeida e Sousa mentioned the eastern partnership but I want to ask about a country that is a bit closer, which is also to the east.  I would appreciate the witnesses' opinions on the situation in Belarus and on the possibility of new sanctions being introduced at this week's European Council meeting.  Even though it was an achievement to agree sanctions on Belarus at the last European Council meeting, I was massively disappointed at the fact that they were relatively narrow and that President Lukashenko was left off them.  I know the German Foreign Minister, in particular, has been outspoken on this but I would like to get Ms Potzel's insight into what we might be able to expect in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the future of Europe, which Senator Chambers mentioned, I would appreciate it if the witnesses could flesh out what preparations, if any, have been undertaken in their countries at a Government and parliamentary level to feed into a confidence in the future of Europe as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue that dominates many minds in this country and across the water when we go away from the pandemic and the budget, namely Brexit.  I am aware that it is not necessarily the biggest issue in other European countries.  We had the fuss over the UK's Internal Market Bill being released at a late hour and it dominated British headlines.  It was the third item on the Irish news but I do not know if it even registered in the news in Portugal or Germany.  Other colleagues I speak to in member states across the EU have all moved on.  Brexit happened on 31 January.  It is difficult for a country such as this, which is so close to the UK and with a shared land border with the UK, to simply move on.  I would appreciate hearing what the impressions of Brexit are in Portugal and Germany.  Where do the witnesses see the potential of the future relationship between the EU and Britain?  I know this issue was touched on earlier and it is vital that we have some form of a future relationship, even if a deal looks less likely at this stage.  In that context, when we talk about recovery and the pandemic, what consideration can the MFF make to the impact that Brexit will have, how it can compound the economic impact of the pandemic and where that might affect the European recovery fund and the approach to Ireland, in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#K00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will start by picking up on Senator Chambers's question on migration.  For a number of reasons, including the refugee crisis we faced in 2015, that is a major topic for us.  We need to stand together in solidarity to alleviate the burden on the front-line countries and we need to find a sustainable European refugee and migration policy.  A restart is needed and that restart must be based on solidarity and on a shared responsibility, both in the internal and external dimensions.  Internally, we are aiming for a common European asylum system, whichensures responsibility sharing and efficiency; curbs secondary migration; lives up to humanitarian standards and fundamental European values; and as I said, truly alleviates the burden on the front-line member states.  We want to progress on those issues.<\/p><p>The debate has started between the member states based on the Commission proposal for a new pact on migration and asylum, and we feel that it is a very good basis.  As the committee will know, it is based on strengthening the externality mentioned, effective protection of the external borders and a fair sharing of the burden through a system of very effective solidarity.  As for the externality mentioned, we feel that European migration policy should strengthen co-operation and equal partnership with countries of origin and transit.  We need to work even more closely with them and that it is part of the European Commission's proposal.  It is a topic that we feel strongly about and we really hope we can push this process forward because it is a contentious issue that we need to overcome in unity and solidarity with one another.  That is very important to us.<\/p><p> On the future of Europe, like many member states, we believe that European citizens, very rightly, want to have a more vocal say.  We need to embrace that willingness to talk about the issues that are important to all of us and to our citizens.  Hopefully, we will see the start of this soon.  Most of the organisational issues, as I understand, have been cleared, although there is still an issue with the various chairpersons.  Other than that, many of the basic factors have been settled and we would like to go ahead with it.<\/p><p> As for concrete measures in Germany, I would like to revert to the committee in writing because there are a number of issues.  We have some experience with civil society dialogue formats.  We have been, and remain, very impressed with the Irish model of the citizens' assembly, so that is definitely something we will incorporate in our ideas.  We also have a cultural programme attached to our Presidency, known as Earth Speaker, which is meant to bring in young people's ideas about the future of Europe.  It is a cultural, online format where young people can express what they want from a future Europe.  It is apparently very successful.  I hope many young Irish girls and boys will join in and bring their views to the table.  It is a first, very important step to bring in young people.<\/p><p> On Europe's place in the world, I am not quite sure I completely got what the Senator was aiming at . We are very happy that we have now agreed with our European partners on the sanctions that were mentioned and that Lukashenko is now on the list.  We will follow the situation very closely and react accordingly to make very clear that we have a united stance on those issues.  In any event, the most important thing is that we work on a joint position and that there will not be deviation among member states . My Portuguese colleague, H.E. Mr. de Almeida e Sousa , mentioned a couple of other issues.<\/p><p> China, of course, is very high on the agenda and we want to broaden the consensus on a more united stance towards it too.  On 14 September, President Michel, the President of the Commission, Ms von der Leyen, and our Chancellor, spoke to President Xi in an informal video conference.  We are hoping for progress on the investment agreement side and we hope it will be possible for the EU-China leaders' meeting to take place in 2021.<\/p><p>The European Council, on 16 November, will again talk about EU-China relations, which will be an important occasion to again show that unified view.  More closely, at the moment we are very worried about the situation in the eastern Mediterranean.  Our foreign Minister was in Cyprus and Greece yesterday.  We are trying to keep a dialogue going because we feel it is of absolute importance to achieve de-escalation.  It is a very worrying situation that we hope to solve rapidly.<\/p><p> Another issue close to our hearts, and regionally close, is that we are seeking to finalise negotiation frameworks and hold a first succession conference with, hopefully, North Macedonia and, if the necessary conditions are fulfilled, also with Albania.  That is something we would like to see, and while I am not going to talk about Africa again, I would be very happy to go into more detail on that matter.<\/p><p> I turn to the view on Brexit in Germany and I am sure H.E. Mr. de Almeida e Sousa will talk about the view in Portugal.  We have said from the start, and it is a commonly shared feeling, that we greatly regret that the British are leaving.  We feel that very deeply and whole-heartedly.  We are losing a good friend, an extremely important political partner and an economic partner.  There is no doubt about that.  Obviously, Ireland&rsquo;s economic relations with the UK are closer than ours but there is no doubt it is a very important economic partner for us . That is why we need and want a close agreement and partnership with the UK.  We do not want to lose it as a friend; we want to work closely with it on political issues and do not want to lose it as an economic partner.  As we have said, however, we need to prepare for all outcomes and, unfortunately, that seems to be becoming even more urgent.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that people in Germany know about the Irish issue.  There is a great deal of information about it and, whenever anything to do with it happens, one can be sure it will be in the main newspapers.  It is a number one topic in the newspapers' online forums.  The UK Internal Market Bill, which was mentioned earlier, was front-page news because people realise how important it is.  We have said time and again that it would be very detrimental to bilateral trust and that we hope the UK will take the Bill off the table or adjust it such that it will not violate the withdrawal agreement nor break international law.  The matter is talked about a great deal back home and it is very topical in all the news there.  It has not been forgotten, although it comes with the notion that we have to look to the future and to move on.  We have to be prepared and I think we have done a good job of preparing ourselves for, as we always say, all possible outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It not only encompasses the economy.  The economy influences everything, but the countries that have a coastline must adapt.  Our oceans are changing, resources are changing and we must explore sustainability.  There must be a debate as to how we will do that, and to ensure that we preserve our fishing industry and the livelihood of fishermen.  Developments in the area of aquaculture will have an impact here and new technologies can be used to explore and define more precisely our capacities.  <\/p><p> We will also need to explore our continental shelves in a reasonable way.  The Irish, French and Spanish continental shelves are in a continuous line and the exploration of them was something we were trying to develop before Covid.  There is considerable scope for co-operation on security because it is a large area and also in the area of the reasonable and controlled access to resources. The use of wave energy is also being developed.<\/p><p> The blue economy is reality would have been part of the UN conference on oceans.  The UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, is a former Portuguese Prime Minister, and someone who was very active in the area of marine policy during his premiership.  It is sometimes forgotten, but there is a European strategy for the sea, which is being implemented without visibility.  We should try to highlight this and show that work is being done.  Developments are being made, but we should do more.  Ireland and Portugal, as coastal countries, have a special responsibility and interest in developing the blue economy.<\/p><p> The sea represents transport, fisheries and the economy.  There are many issues currently being debated such as those concerning the environment and plastic in our oceans and there is a lot of scope for us to highlight issues.  The blue economy would be a good topic for Ireland to raise at the meeting in Lisbon.<\/p><p> Regarding Belarus, I have nothing to add to the comments made by H.E. Ms Potzel.  <\/p><p> On the question raised regarding the future of Europe and the preparations made, like Germany, Portugal followed the Irish model on the debate with the citizens.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee, visited Lisbon and participated in an event.  She attended the Portuguese Parliament to discuss and present, and I was impressed by what I saw.  I suggested that the Irish model should be followed and it was.  At the conference on the future of Europe, we need to reach out, and we should ask what we can do with what we have.  We saw with the last referendum that people are growing a little tired of the rules always changing.  We have a framework and we should work on it.  If we need to change it in the future, we can, but for the time being, we should have a debate that is faithful to the objective, to reflect on our policies and gauge the feelings of the member states on what they would like Europe to be.<\/p><p>If we develop the policies as we are doing now, and that have been identified by everyone, we will reach out to our citizens, which is one of the main priorities of our Presidency.<\/p><p> Regarding Brexit, I will tell the Senator how present the issue is in Portugal.  Not a day goes by without a report on this issue.  Sometimes I have to move faster than journalists because they can report on issues quicker than I can and they do not have the same things to do that I have.  However, it is very much a current issue and it is something that people feel.  It is not a foreign problem for them.  For example, if one goes to Portugal and speaks to those working in business, rather than those in parliament, it is clear that they are very aware of the issue, and their solidarity with Ireland has not failed since the beginning of the process.  Irish and Portuguese people share similarities and are close, even if the Irish are more fair in their colouring.  The Irish and Portuguese are also similar in how they react to things, which some may find surprising.  There is also a European and Atlantic solidarity.  Brexit is, therefore, current in Portugal.  As H.E. Ms Potzel stated, we want to maintain a close relationship with the UK because it will solve many problems, but we also want a balanced one which will preserve the integrity of the Internal Market, which Ireland and the whole of Europe needs.  We are prepared to come to a solution, and a solution will be reached, but it is too early to say what form that solution will take, because what happens from week to week in London varies.  We hope the situation stabilises.  Following that, we must find concrete solutions to ensure the provisions and objectives of the protocol are applied and remain intact.  These are concerns that Ireland and the other EU member states share.<\/p><p> I reassure the Senator that Portugal has not forgotten about Brexit, and it remains a major topic.  I am always reporting on the issue.  Even when Michel Barnier sneezes, I have to report on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I express gratitude for the strong expression of solidarity with Ireland in relation to the unique difficulties that Brexit poses for us.  We recognise that there are still pressure points to come, so that solidarity is not a past issue.  We all hope that an agreement will be reached, but in the event that there is no agreement, the protocol is a settled matter and not one to be undermined.  If we repeat that message, it increases the prospect of a deal being reached.<\/p> <p>  I have read the Presidency programmes.  Presidency programmes are quite like programmes for Government in that they are extraordinarily ambitious for being programmes of just a six-month duration, but I suppose one needs a continuum.  I will ask three questions, even though, like Deputy Richmond, I could ask 1,000 questions on what H.E. Ms Potzel has said and on the programme itself.<\/p> <p>  Everything in the German Presidency programme has been overshadowed by the Covid pandemic.  I will not say it has been undermined because that is not the case, but it has been impacted by the pandemic.<\/p><p>The pandemic itself has impacted on European citizens' view of Europe.  I believe it is fair comment to say there was a certain lack of solidarity at the beginning of the pandemic.  All the cohesion of Europe seemed to be undermined in a rush to nationalism and protectionism in respect of our borders, medicine supply and acute hospital systems.  That needs to be repaired.  I am keen to hear from the ambassadors whether they believe the multi-annual financial framework of funding, the expression of solidarity and the future sharing of vaccines and medicines will rebuild that eroded sense of solidarity from the beginning of the pandemic.<\/p><p> My second question is a Brexit-related topic.  It relates to the ambition within the German Presidency for a strengthening and integration of capital markets in Europe.  Obviously, the removal of the City of London from the EU sphere will have an impact on financial services generally.  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on the developed model of how the integrated and strengthened capital markets within a European Union without the City of London is envisaged.<\/p><p> My third question relates to growing nationalism in the European Union.  It is an issue we discussed briefly in the preparation of our work programme.  The German and Portuguese commentaries both underscored the importance of strengthening fundamental European social values.  These are clearly being undermined in several European countries where the rule of law, having an independent judiciary, freedom of the press and individual human rights, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, LGBT, rights, have been significantly assaulted.  I am keen to hear the uptake of the ambassadors and, rather than simply the rhetoric of saying this is a bad thing, how it will be fundamentally addressed.  If the values of Europe are fundamentally undermined, then the European project itself is fundamentally undermined.  Is there a place in the next phase of European Union development for countries that do not subscribe to those fundamental values?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#O00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassadors.  I will not repeat some of the comments that have been made but I echo most of them, especially the comments around Brexit.  The position that has been adopted in terms of support for the Irish protocol is much appreciated.  I know we are facing a highly challenging period now.  I believe Boris Johnson has set tomorrow as the deadline.  While I do not believe that is realistic, certainly time is of the essence at this point.  The support is noted and welcome.<\/p> <p>  I want to home in on some areas around the humanitarian crisis and the migration issue.  The fire in Lesbos at Moria probably catapulted the issue to centre stage again.  There are concerns that this ultimately exposed the complete failure of Europe to address one of the major humanitarian duties facing us, as it has been described, by allowing the situation to get to that point.  I believe there has been failure by many countries.  I am keen to get a viewpoint on the responses of different countries to living up to obligations and commitments made in previous agreements, like the agreement in 2015, for example.  Only last week I cited our response in this State, especially in dealing with unaccompanied minors.  There was an agreement here to accept 35 unaccompanied minors in 2015.  To date, I understand we have only taken in nine.  I am keen to get a viewpoint on that.  Are countries living up to their commitments and obligations?  What hopes are there for a new migration agreement if previous ones have not been adhered to and if previous obligations have not been lived up to?<\/p><p>On the issue of Palestine, over the summer there was a lot of concern around the threats and moves to annex large parts of the West Bank.  Eleven EU foreign affairs ministers wrote to Europe to ask for guidance as to what measures could be taken if Israel annexed large sections of the area.  I understood they considered different measures, such as potential embargoes, trade etc.  I acknowledge that annexation <i>per se<\/i>has fallen off the agenda.  It is not receiving the same media spotlight as was the case during the summer.  That is not to say that annexation is not happening on a daily basis.  The two-state solution and a viable Palestinian state are being dismantled on a daily basis.  It is simply not being spoken about.  The D&aacute;il voted overwhelmingly a number of years ago to officially recognise the state of Palestine.  It is an issue that has been debated at European level over a number of years.  Is it now time, at European level, to recognise the state of Palestine officially?  What measures are being or will be looked at if the hopes, dreams and aspirations of people living in the state are ultimately destroyed with the annexation of up to 30% of the West Bank? <br\/><br\/> I wish to touch on the right to determination.  In October 2017, the Catalan people voted overwhelmingly to express their right to self-determination and to live in an independent Catalan state.  Since that time, parliamentarians have been imprisoned.  Recently, the Catalan President was banned from public office.  As was said, it is ultimately an attempt to destroy the Government of Catalonia.  Very little has been said about it at a European level.  The silence of the Government regarding this attack on the democratic process has been deafening.  What approach will be taken to the continued blatant disregard for the express views of the majority of the Catalan people in terms of self-determination?  What measures will be taken by the outgoing German Presidency and incoming Portuguese Presidency?<br\/><br\/>It was stated that the escalating situation in the eastern Mediterranean is deeply concerning.  Some measures have been taken to bring all parties around the table.  I note that Turkey has sent a research ship back into the waters that are of grave concern.  That may show that that side is not being serious about negotiations and coming to some sort of solution.  Greece has expressed particular concerns and vetoed a position on Belarus.  That was quite concerning.  I welcome the measures that have been adopted by Europe in terms of Belarus but similar actions and measures are not being taken in respect of other countries.  Over many years Turkey has been involved in the unlawful occupation of northern Cyprus.<\/p><p>This issue has not been dealt with by Europe.  Now we see a concerning situation in the eastern Mediterranean that has massive implications for Europe, not only in terms of destabilisation but the risk of potential conflict.  What measures are being looked at?  I know the primary objective is to get everyone around the table but that is difficult when some of the people who should be around the table are ratcheting up tensions by sending out ships.  Will the ambassador give a viewpoint on the eastern Mediterranean because it is an issue, unfortunately, that will continue to escalate until all partners get around the table?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#P00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I am happy to see Deputy Howlin in good health.  Regarding his questions, it is true that in the beginning the response given to the pandemic was very national in the sense that governments had to show their citizens that they were acting.  However, President von der Leyen has said from the very beginning the EU was working on it without visibility.  On many issues, one of the problems for the EU is that its work is not acknowledged or known but it is done.  That is one of the European problems and it is a problem of perception.  The EU has worked like a hut or covering and it has been very important on co-ordination as a result.  It has created the forum where we can exchange information.  It provided some alternatives and solutions for dealing with different aspects of the pandemic.  Now people acknowledge there is a role for the European Commission but it started before it was known.  I sat in Brussels for many years and I knew that sometimes outside the Council, we are keen to show there is a victory and we are successful when, in fact, often there is compromise so it is success for everyone and not only one member state.  Sometimes it is a problem of presentation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding future treatments and vaccines, this is a global pandemic which will have a global solution.  This will not be only inside the EU or the US.  Today we heard from several laboratories that are exploring.  They say it will be for the benefit of all humanity.  The treatment will be worldwide.  It is global because if we solve a problem on one side but not the other, it will come back.  We need a global approach and it will come.<\/p> <p>  On nationalism in the EU, it is true that we have it in several countries.  In Portugal, for example, we do not have it.  It is not known but we have an unsolved problem with Spain regarding a small corner.  The problem is still open but we do not discuss it.<\/p><p>We have a very pragmatic view that we will solve it.  This dates from the 18th century so it is has been a long time.<\/p><p> We do not have nationalism but there is an increase.  We were saying earlier that if people have a perception of the benefits of the European Union, Europe will answer to them.  That will be the best solution to fighting nationalism.  Every member state must apply the rule of law and the rules of democracy.  We have to find balanced solutions to ensure that it will do so.  I agree it is a big problem but the more successfully the European Union works, the less probability of this surge of nationalism being successful and it will diminish.<\/p><p> Regarding the protocol, it was signed by all member states so it is international law.  It was ratified so it is untouchable.  If there is no Brexit deal, we have to find solutions to ensure that what we intend to protect with the protocol will work.  In terms of how we will do that, let us take one worry at a time.<\/p><p> Regarding Israel, I served as ambassador to Israel before coming to Ireland.  One of the lessons I learned is that it is a country where nothing is obvious.  I was still in Israel when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, came to visit.  He had a very good approach regarding Israel.  Ireland, with the positions it has taken, is listened to carefully now.  The problem with the Middle East is that there are different narratives.  They fight for the same land, which is not very large.  Some kind of solution will come.  When one travels around Israel, and the officials with me may not see it, one will see that there is a consciousness that a two-state solution will come about.  It will be needed.  It is not forgotten.  I know that the values and principles of the EU are presented every day.  We have taken several measures and they made the Israeli Government reconsider some of its decisions and the statements.  It is a region where, in the end, the victory comes from the one who speaks louder but what is behind it can sometimes be completely different.  I can share with the members my experience in Israel.  The position of the EU has not changed.  It is two states for two peoples living in peace and security.  That is the position also of several countries around it.  I know it is difficult but as was said, it is full of ups and downs.<\/p><p> Regarding Catalonia, it is a Spanish internal problem.  There are constitutional mechanisms to solve it.  We hope they will be acting on those and the European Union can follow on that point.  However, it is up to the Spanish regions to resolve the issue of how they can be together.  If they decided to split, which I hope will never be the case, that will be a decision made by all of them.  The problem must be treated within the constitutional framework of Spain.<\/p><p>The problem regarding the eastern Mediterranean is serious.  Germany has an important role as mediator and the mediation is more or less working.  It is an unsolved problem, of course, that the European Union is in solidarity with the member states involved but also has a responsibility to help in some way to find a solution which cannot be imposed; it must be decided by all of them.  <\/p><p> These are problematic areas where one cannot impose a solution from the outside.  It does not work like that.  Where needed, one's role will be more efficient if one intervenes as mediator, adviser and encourager.  However, if one tries to impose on some of the Catalan cases, I know it will be counterproductive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"H.E. Mr. Miguel de Almeida e Sousa","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>That was so comprehensive that I will pick up on, perhaps, one or two things and keep it short.  Mr. de Almeida e Sousa described the impact and lack of solidarity, as the Deputy described it, within the EU regarding the pandemic.  It would be wonderful if we could change that narrative a little bit in the sense that we might be able to look at what has been achieved since.  There is no doubt mistakes were made at the beginning and that we could have done better.  On the other hand, this thing came of the blue and we did not have a blueprint in the drawers of how to go about it.  Since health policy is still a national competency, everybody was focusing on an immediate response.  As Mr. de Almeida e Sousa said and as everybody agrees, mistakes were made in that process.<br\/><br\/>We can, however, be proud of the solidarity that has been shown within the EU.  I think of the hundreds of thousands of stranded tourists we brought back together.  Everybody helped one another.  German and Portuguese tourists were on Irish planes and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We brought back Irish and Portuguese people as well.  That was helpful.  I do not want to brag about what we did but I know what Germany did.  It was appreciated that we took in patients from Italy and France when their ICUs were overloaded.  We will now hopefully get the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and recovery fund going.  We are taking that much money into our hands to help and deviate from or overcome the economic and social impacts of the pandemic.  It is also worthwhile looking at the positives achieved in that process.<br\/><br\/>I wish also to say a few words on the concern about growing nationalism in the EU, which we all agree we need to look into.  We are doing so and, as Mr. de Almeida e Sousa said, we need to talk with citizens in our societies about the importance of the values of the European Union which we all agree upon.  We need to do that.  I will allude to the fact we celebrated 30 years of German reunification on 3 October.  I was born in East Germany and I know what it feels like not to have the freedoms we all enjoy in Europe, that is, the freedoms of expression, movement and assembly and the freedom to design and pursue one's life in a space of freedom and liberty.<\/p><p>We need to talk about this more in our societies.  We must also keep reaching out to what are known as the \"bubbles\" on social media to try to break those bubbles and reach out to people who are not of the same view.  We need to keep that dialogue going to make people aware of the wonderful treasure that we have in our open, liberal and democratic societies.  That is extremely important.  There are reasons or roots for nationalism which are very different in every country and it is important for countries to look at that themselves, I suppose.  We do have ways and means, such as the Article 7 procedures against Hungary and Poland that are going on and will go on and, also, in the European context, to deal with certain aspects of the rule of law and to defend the rule of law in our member states.<\/p><p> On Palestine, we have and will continue to strongly advocate a two-state solution for Palestine and Israel.  We are in very close contact with our Israeli friends, but also with our Palestinian friends.  There is a huge amount of economic support for Palestine.  We have a close relationship to both Israeli and Palestine and with reference to the annexation plans, we have been very clear and very outspoken to our Israeli friends that we feel that that is a step in the wrong direction and that we still advocate a two-state solution.  We are very clear on that, including as a member of the EU.  Our foreign minister had a very good exchange with the Israeli foreign minister at one of the last meetings of the Council.  I cannot recall at which council but the latter attended for a lunch and the ministers had a very good exchange on all these matters.  <\/p><p> On the eastern Mediterranean, we are very much in solidarity with our Cypriot friends and our Greek friends.  We tried to reach out to Turkey and we will keep trying.  We have said that back and forth from the Turkish side in terms of agreeing to talk and then sending in another ship is not helpful.  We have said that is definitely not helping the dialogue.  We will sit together in the EU.  We have told our friends from Cyprus that we will sit together and figure out what other signals we can send to the Turkish Government to make it even more aware of where we stand on this.  We will not give up on that - definitely not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#T00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I will make two points.  The first is related to the agreement yesterday by the Council to a traffic light system to co-ordinate travel restrictions across Europe, putting in place a common mapping system to define areas at different levels of risk.  Is there broad support for this in Portugal and Germany?  Do the ambassadors think we are a little behind when it comes to Covid-19 pre-flight testing?  Is it something the Presidency may be thinking of rolling out?  We need to get our countries up and running again economically and we are going to be living with Covid for some time.  Should pre-flight testing be part of our agenda in Europe going forward?<\/p> <p>  My next point is in regard to the future of Europe, putting the citizen at the centre of that and building alliances.<\/p><p>Our guest witnesses' countries have very ambitious Presidency programmes.  How ambitious are their countries in respect of putting their citizens first?  At present, in Ireland we offer free travel to our citizens over the age of 65.  I note that this is also done in Belgium and Hungary.  Would it not be wonderful if we could build alliances to offer free travel or discounted travel to all of our elderly citizens within our European states?  Many people today when going abroad when over the age of 70 cannot even hire a car in some of these European countries because of their age.  Perhaps that might be an ambitious programme for our guests to take back as part of their Presidency of the European Council in the future.  That would be one way to put the citizens first.  Those are the two points I wished to make to our guest and I thank them for coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#U00300","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>We have had a wide-ranging discussion here this morning and have covered all of the major topics.<\/p><p>I refer to an editorial in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>dated 2 June 2020 relating to Chancellor Merkel, which stated, &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s longest-serving leader faces an Olympian test of her eye for detail, her nose for negotiation and her ear for compromise.&rdquo;  The article refers to Chancellor Merkel as &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s safest pair of hands&rdquo;.  We are fortunate to have Chancellor Merkel in the Presidency at this particularly challenging time for Europe and I refer especially to the Covid-19 problem.  Our witnesses have outlined the major concerns and issues in respect of the current Presidency and the incoming Presidency.<\/p><p>We had an unprecedented budget for unprecedented times yesterday here.  The multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the associated recovery fund are also unprecedented.  It should not be lost on anybody that Europe will borrow money to get us out of this serious economic situation.  I am hoping that by the time Portugal takes over, some of these issues will be off the agenda, that the recovery fund will be up and running and we will have an agreement or no agreement with the United Kingdom.  One way or another, Brexit is coming to a conclusion and like the other speakers, I thank both of our guests&rsquo; countries for the solidarity they have shown to the Irish situation arising from Brexit.  <\/p><p>On migration and refugee policy generally and the Commission proposal, migration is a big issue in several European states and we have referred to the rise of nationalism and of populism.  I hope the ambassador from Portugal does not mind if I ask the German ambassador a specific question.  On the domestic opinion on migration in Germany, the ambassador spoke of the need for solidarity on a European level and the need to share the burden.  Would that be a widely held view among the citizens of Germany?  Is it a general humanitarian concern or an economic concern?  We all remember the pictures on our television screens of Germany opening up its borders and the queues of refugees arriving in.  That really made an impression and brought home the whole migration situation to all of us.  I am interested to know what the domestic opinion is on this issue and why that decision was taken?  Is there a strong humanitarian concern in Germany among its citizens?  <\/p><p>Otherwise, I wish both of our guests well in their endeavours.  We had a long discussion on the rule of law and on the conference on the future of Europe.  The Irish model in the first phases of that went very well and the Irish citizens were significantly engaged with that process.  I recall that the then Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, spearheaded that process.  <\/p><p>I ask that my one specific question be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#V00300","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank both Ambassador Potzel and Ambassador de Almeida e Sousa and I also apologise now for my pronunciations.<\/p><p>An awful lot has been dealt with.  I also thank our guests for their solidarity on Brexit.  They may not feel inclined to answer the following question but I am going to ask it anyway.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to the committee last week and expressed his view that Britain needs a deal as badly as anyone else and, to a degree, we need to concentrate on ensuring a deal that will protect Europe and Ireland, and gives Britain what it needs.  That said, we must allow for a worst-case scenario.  The Internal Market Bill is now in place and we must consider the possibility of other legislation and the circumventing of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  I welcome the fact that our guests have said that they will stand with Ireland.  Could I ask for some detail on that, as far as our guests can go?  There is a need for an almost hermetical seal around the Single Market and customs union.  What happens in a doomsday Brexit situation?<\/p><p> I welcome what has been said about the improving pandemic response.  There has been mention of the traffic light system and I would also throw the testing scenario into that.  Our considerations are the future as regards the health response, which is changing all the time, and the recovery fund and what we do about that.  There has perhaps been too much of an emphasis on loans versus grants.  Down the line, we must look at something that will be more of a Marshall Plan-type scenario.  How would our guests foresee that happening?<\/p><p> Mention was made earlier about the future of Europe.  There are difficulties surrounding the multi-annual financial framework.  Our guests have spoken about moving in the direction of a social Europe.  The pandemic has taught us of the necessity of public service and governmental intervention.  Europe has been very good but, to a degree, there has been an overemphasis in latter years on private enterprise and the free flow of capital, although I do not wish to take away from those things.  We need protection for people and some of that is about the ability at European or governmental level to bring in necessary protections.  We have had to ride roughshod over certain rules at domestic and European levels to do what was necessary to respond to the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#V00500","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank the committee members for their questions.  I was asked about the broad support for the traffic light system.  It is very much in the interests of our citizens that they have clarity on how, where and when they can travel.  Much of the insecurity that we observe arises from changing targets and it is important that we have an agreement.  There is broad support within the population in Germany.  I do not have poll numbers to reflect that but I think there is broad support for this clarity that gives people something to work with.  We get asked what is going on every day at the embassy.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  I will send back the recommendation on free travel for senior citizens.  There are obviously discount measures in all countries but I will definitely send back the Senator's suggestion.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Haughey for his warm words about Chancellor Merkel.  He asked about migration and the domestic opinion in Germany.  One has to say that it is a mixed picture.  At the beginning, the Chancellor decided to keep the borders open and it is important to stress that.<\/p><p>A lot of people say the Chancellor opened the borders but she really kept them open.  She would have had to make a decision to close them but she left them open and that was definitely a humanitarian decision.  People on many points of the political spectrum supported that decision but in the aftermath we have seen that the influx of almost 1 million refugees also led to a strengthening of right-leaning parties in Germany too.  Overall however, five years on from the decision and the 2015 refugee crisis, the feeling in Germany is that it worked out well and that integration of foreigners and refugees - which we still have to improve - worked well.  I think it is reported in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that for the first time ever, the population of Germany is shrinking and we realise we do actually need immigration as a country.<br\/><br\/>As such, it is a mixed picture.  Some people would not be very much in agreement with the way the German Government handled it and they are worried about certain aspects of it but if one looks at opinion polls, the majority of people would say we did well and that we also profit from immigration.  Obviously, however, in view of the migration policy and asylum policy we are trying to put in place in European countries, we have to make efforts to deal with illegal immigration and to look into how to react to people who do not have a reason for getting asylum, for instance.  We definitely need to look at these issues.  All in all, however, I think the opinion is, as I said, pretty positive on that back home.<br\/><br\/>In a quick word on Brexit, we keep saying we expect the British Government to fully respect the obligations in the withdrawal agreement and we will keep saying that.  Obviously the protection of the Single Market is paramount and Ireland has said that time and again as well.  I think we are all in the same boat on this.  The Chancellor has also said more than once that it is not an Irish problem but a European one.As such we will keep telling the Brits to stick to the withdrawal agreement and of course the Northern Ireland protocol.  If we do not succeed in getting a deal and it ends up in a no-deal scenario, we will still keep pushing them to implement what they have signed up for.  That is as much as I can say on that at the moment.<br\/><br\/>On protection of citizens, if I got that question correctly, looking at the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and especially the recovery fund, I think most of the targets there are aimed at helping our citizens to get through this pandemic and to overcome the repercussions due to the pandemic.  While it might not always be spelled out, it is definitely there.  In addition, one of our priorities that I have not mentioned yet was a social Europe and the protection of our citizens, our youngsters and youth, which is very important.  We feel that also requires a strong, co-ordinated European response but that is definitely also something we want.  We want to strengthen the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, for instance, within the EU framework for national minimum wages or minimum security schemes.  We intend to evaluate the proposal for a European unemployment reinsurance scheme.  It was announced by the European Commission and is very important to us.<\/p><p>We are also committed to strengthening the Youth Guarantee and tackling youth unemployment.  Perhaps these are not among the headlines, given what is going on at present, but they are important parts of our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020101400002#W00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Ms Potzel spoke about solidarity and co-operation.  She also spoke about freedom, and we cannot speak enough about the freedoms we enjoy as members of the European Union.  Mr. de Almeida e Sousa spoke about resilience, which is something we can identify with on the west coast of this wee island with regard to looking out at the wild Atlantic Ocean.  There is no direct equivalent word in the Irish language for resilience but there is an expression for resilience, which is teacht aniar.  I do not know whether it came from west Kerry, Connemara or Donegal but when people woke up on Monday morning, looked out at the sea and tried to figure out where they would go from there during tough times, certainly resilience came to mind.<\/p> <p>  Digitisation is the theme of the German Presidency and it is very interesting to hear the continuity on this.  The whole idea of having both witnesses today was continuity, and they also work closely with their Slovakian colleagues.  Mr. de Almeida e Sousa said Portugal will work with the instruments developed by the German Presidency to continue that work.  This is very important as we try to pave a way forward.<\/p> <p>  We are also conscious of the multi-annual financial framework and the funding for it from 2021 to 2027.  Whatever work comes out of digitisation there are also questions within it on how we engage with citizens.  Physical interaction varies between limited and non-existent.  How do we put the European citizen at the centre of these deliberations and conversations?  Senator Keogan used a practical example.  We still have opportunities to do this.  While people cannot meet and limited interaction is the conversation of the day, with digitisation people can still communicate.<\/p><p>The witnesses have emphasised a stronger and more innovative Europe.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the principle of subsidiarity, which has been flying around Europe for a number of decades, we are in that space now.  We can work according to the principle of subsidiarity in that we can hear the voices of people in very rural and marginalised, peripheral areas because of digital opportunities but we need to back up our capacity and build resilience.  All of us in this room have examples from our constituencies and countries of communities that are considering more innovative approaches.  In my parish, Carrigart, we are building a digital hub.  Towns such as Rathmullan in my county are looking at smart villages.  There is an example of funding for smart villages throughout Europe but I believe we can build on the capacity a little more.  I will have information on that.  I do not require a response today but I can forward the information.<br\/><br\/>An old Irish saying I came across in Connemara a couple of years ago is, &quot;Castar na daoine ar a ch&eacute;ile ach n&iacute; chastar na cnoic n&aacute; na sl&eacute;ibhte.&quot;  &quot;The people meet but the hills and the mountains do not.&quot;  At present, we face an unbelievable dilemma: not alone do the hills and mountains not meet but the people do not meet either.  Therefore, we have to work so much harder at connecting people.  It is a matter of building resilience and connections.  Ambassador Potzel, <i>danke<\/i>.

Ciara Mellett is the new head of Healthy Ireland, which is a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Caroline Pigott is our head of resources in the Sl&aacute;intecare office and Grainne Healy is our head of citizen engagement.  If the members have any particular questions on those areas they can address them to those colleagues.<\/p> <p>  As most of the members know, the Sl&aacute;intecare report emanated from the all-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It is a ten-year healthcare reform.  We translated that into an implementation strategy, an action plan and, this year, a joint action programme.  We are taking a programmatic approach to the implementation of this vast and exciting programme.<\/p> <p>  The key principles are delivering the right care in the right place at the right time and given by the right team; promoting health and well-being and preventing illness; bringing the majority of care into the community; creating an integrated system of care that is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay; and moving from long waiting times to a timely service, with accountability and performance at the heart of it.  Fundamentally, it is about trying to deliver a health service that has the capability and capacity to manage changing needs.  This will be done through a population-based planning approach with clear pathways between GPs, community and social care services and hospitals and empowerment of front-line staff, with one budget per region.  It was a decision by Government last year that we would be moving to this regional implementation.  Fundamentally, it is about many parts of the system working together in terms of community healthcare workers, occupational health, dental services, GPs etc. and all of the HSE colleagues across the system.<\/p> <p>  We are in year two of implementation.  Our job in the implementation office, which is based in the Department of Health, is to ensure that all parts of the system are following the strategy, to work collaboratively and to report on progress.  This year, it is also about learning the lessons from Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  I will not go through them but we have a variety of implementation work streams.  It is a vast programme with many moving cogs that all need to work together, and there is a strategy behind that.  Fundamental to it, and it was very much addressed in the budget, is the capacity and access programme, which is about making sure we have enough access so that people can hit the Sl&aacute;intecare target waiting times for inpatient, outpatient, diagnostics, emergency department, ED, and community care and that we have enough human and infrastructural capacity after reforms in line with the health capacity review.  These are divided into three big pillars.  One is about healthy living, which is our Healthy Ireland programme.  Another is about enhanced community care, which I will talk about, and the other is about hospital productivity improvements.<\/p> <p>  Regarding progress to date on healthy living, we have our Healthy Ireland strategy, which rolls out the obesity policy, physical health and sexual health strategies and a focus on prevention and citizen engagement.  We have many initiatives with partners across the country to roll that out, including with Healthy Cities and Counties, the Healthy Ireland charter network, the warmth and well-being scheme and the Making Every Contact Count initiative through GPs.  <\/p> <p>  Interestingly, in the budget for next year we have a new area-based health and well-being initiative in disadvantaged areas with a ring-fenced additional &euro;20 million for Healthy Ireland this year, which we very much welcome.<\/p> <p>  In terms of enhanced community care, the focus is on rolling out community healthcare networks with a basis of population for 50,000 in a group.  There will be 96 of those across the country,with chronic disease and older persons specialist hubs, integrated care, GPs, community and hospitals.  This will be enabled through healthcare pathways, and I would be very interested in elaborating on that if we get the opportunity to do so.  The approach is to help these mini-communities of approximately 50,000 across the country.<\/p><p>The impact of this community care initiative will be to move patients with ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions from hospitals into the community.  The funding in yesterday's budget and through last year is very welcome and will mean these 96 area-based services can be rolled out and we can start to give the care in the community that is absolutely needed.  The provision will be based around the older persons and chronic disease service model, moving between the hospital, community and GPs and making sure we can treat people and keep them living well at home as long as possible.<\/p><p> Throughout this year we have had some very interesting innovation funds, with 122 different projects all around the country represented by the little red dots members can see on the screen.  These projects are about encouraging innovation, shifting care to the community and scaling and sharing examples of best practice and processes for chronic disease management.  There are some lovely examples of this happening throughout the country and fantastic learnings coming through from these projects, which will be scaled into next year.  I have set out the details of the different projects in my opening statement but I will not go through them now.  Fundamentally, they are about providing services for people and making sure they get the right care in the right place.<\/p><p> In terms of hospital productivity, we are looking at streamlining ways of working.  There have been great innovations such as the ambulance service's hear and treat initiative, pathways to treat people outside of hospital, virtual clinics and trauma centres and hospital avoidance measures.  An example is the virtual clinics for heart failure which have moved outpatient department treatment into the community.  This has meant fewer people going to hospital, with 90% of treatment now being delivered in the community.  We are making great progress on our elective hospitals development project and hope to have a business case ready before the end of the year.  The oversight group is being chaired by Professor Frank Keane.<\/p><p> Regarding the implementation status, we have had, through 2020, a quarter of the funding needed for community services.  That allocation is massively augmented in the budget for 2021.  Our e-health priorities are agreed and capital funded, we have a business case for elective hospitals and there are innovative care re-design initiatives addressing waiting lists.  We were very pleased that the programme for Government reaffirmed the commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare and we are very grateful for the support of this committee in keeping an all-party focus on its implementation.<\/p><p> I do not have time to go through the many learnings from Covid.  Many things were fast-tracked during the pandemic, particularly e-health and new ways of working.  People showed they could adapt and were up for a change and looking for new ways of doing things.  We see this in the use of e-health video consultations, the deployment of the individual health identifier, the attend anywhere booking system and Healthlink, which gathers information back to GPs.  We have a superb programme of e-health initiatives which is now fully funded in the budget and we will be able to implement it with speed over the next two years.  Huge progress was made on the individual health identifier initiative this year.  Everybody in the country now has an identifier and we are moving towards a shared care record in the coming years.<\/p><p> Our priorities for 2020 to 2023 are, first, to keep people well at home or near home, out of hospital and living independent lives.  That will be worked on through a series of initiatives which I do not have time to go through today but are based around health pathways, enhanced community funding, scaling integration funds and implementing related projects.  Our second priority is to achieve the waiting list targets through implementing the capacity and access programme, devising a multi-annual waiting list plan and commissioning the ambulatory elective centres.  The third priority is around standing back and looking at things from the perspective of a citizen care master plan, working towards universal eligibility and multi-annual funding.<\/p><p> The budget has provided a huge investment in Sl&aacute;intecare, amounting to approximately &euro;1.34 billion.  It will provide permanent funding for initiatives that have sometimes only had part-time funding.  It is a really welcome initiative.  The challenges and implementation risks for our implementation office are around ensuring there is a co-ordination of effort moving in the direction in which Sl&aacute;intecare was set by the Oireachtas committee.  The recruitment at scale is going to be a big issue.  A huge investment in people is required in terms of getting the right personnel in place.  The ongoing Covid impact on non-Covid services is something we all must live with and adapt to over time.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss these matters with the committee.  I am very happy to continue the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#A01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Magahy.

As Ms Magahy said, we are delighted to have this opportunity to engage with the committee and meet the new members.  As the committee is aware, during 2020, the Irish health services faced unprecedented pressures as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Following NPHET's decision on 27 March regarding the required public health measures, many non-urgent healthcare services were reduced or suspended altogether.  In recent months, the HSE has focused on restoring those services as far as possible, which involves delivering care in very different ways and in different settings and maximising opportunities fro technology.<\/p> <p>  Many of the service changes made this year in the context of Covid-19 align fully with the vision and direction of travel set out in Sl&aacute;intecare but there remains much to do if we are to effect the complete transformation of healthcare services in Ireland that is required.  The OECD's recent country profile for 2019 noted that, in comparison with other countries, Ireland has made good progress on life expectancy but some members of our community still experience worse outcomes than others.  We consume too much alcohol and do not maintain healthy weights.  Access to services is an issue and we have a lower proportion per head of population of practising doctors than elsewhere.  We must seek to achieve better outcomes for everybody, recognising that where we are falling behind, we need to address that and focusing our efforts on reversing those trends and accelerating the digitisation of our health service.<\/p> <p>  A key principle of Sl&aacute;intecare, as Ms Magahy outlined, is the right of patients to timely access to all healthcare and social care services according to clinical need.  In addition to the recent impact of Covid-19, there were already increasing pressures for a number of years on our scheduled and unscheduled care services as a result of population growth, increasing instances of chronic disease and an aging population.  As well as needing the right people and the right infrastructure, including buildings, equipment and technology, to deliver the right services, we need to recalibrate and remodel how we deliver those services.  Consistent with Sl&aacute;intecare, we are seeking to shift the delivery of care from the hospital setting to community settings, with a greater emphasis on prevention and supporting the population to remain healthy and well.  Our aim is to sustainably address long waiting times for scheduled care services and in emergency departments, rather than just putting in short-term fixes, particularly for older people and those with more complex needs.  In that context, it is crucial that we reduce bed occupancy levels in hospitals and reduce our reliance on community residential models of care by expanding our primary and community care services.  We must enable our aging population to maintain their independence and live in the community by delivering care as close as possible to patients' homes.<\/p> <p>  While we anticipate that the continued management of Covid-19 and the restarting and delivery of core services will be a primary focus for us over the next 12 to 18 months, the wider transformation of services for the long term must occur in parallel in order to ensure we emerge stronger from the pandemic and build on the positive changes we have seen within the service in the past year.  The implementation of the recommendations of the 2018 health service capacity review has been agreed by both the Department and the HSE as a starting point for developing our capacity across community and acute services, while also reducing bed demand and improving the health of the population.  The capacity review identifies the need for significant increases in capacity across a range of community and acute services.  Consistent with that, we have made investments in a range of community and acute services, including additional home support hours and enhanced home support packages.  As Ms Magahy said, progress on the community health networks and community specialist teams will very much accelerate in the next year.  There will be a focus on ramping up the availability of diagnostics to GPs in the community and other settings and increasing the number of community, step-down and acute beds.  The very welcome investment in yesterday's budget for the health service will allow further significant increases in capacity during 2021.<\/p> <p>  Working closely with Ms Magahy and other departmental colleagues, the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare will continue to feature very prominently in the work of the HSE in all our planning processes and also in our operational decision making.  It is clear that we will be living with Covid-19 and its impacts for some time to come.  Our experience in recent months demonstrates that we are capable of driving positive change and innovating in response to unprecedented challenges.  We are living in extraordinary times where, despite the challenges the pandemic presents, there are nonetheless huge opportunities for us to make real changes happen for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

They have provided us with a lot of information on what is a very important area.<\/p><p>We had a presentation last week from mental health groups, specifically Mental Health Ireland and Jigsaw.  The representatives spoke about the percentage of the budget going to mental health and we also heard about the percentage going to GP and primary care services.  Everybody's percentage cannot increase because, otherwise, that for some area of the health sector would have to drop.  Where are we out of step, comparatively, with our EU counterparts in the context of health spending and how can it be reprofiled?<\/p><p> There was mention of community healthcare networks.  How do these compare with the primary care settings?  I presume they would be part of that.  We have seen the rolling out of many impressive buildings and there is always a question regarding buy-in from GPs.  We have the infrastructure in many parts but not the buy-in from GPs.<\/p><p> There are areas in my county and close to Galway city, for example, that would not be covered by Westdoc.  This can have an impact on recruitment of GPs.  The system could break down if the recruitment is not there.  If we are looking to invest, should we start by ensuring that there is adequate cover for Westdoc and other regional services?<\/p><p> I am interested in the issue of chronic illness.  Heart failure in a community setting is very often overlooked, especially in comparison with cancer, but it is responsible for one in every two hospital admissions relating to people over 65.  This is heart failure as opposed to heart attacks, although the difference may not be understood by everybody in the country.  Do community voluntary charity organisations feature to the fullest extent in all of this?  For example, Cro&iacute; in the west of Ireland undertakes really excellent work with people on a holistic approach to health.  Could more be done in this regard?<\/p><p> Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned the long waits for scheduled care services and accident and emergency departments.  We will speak at some stage about capital plans.  There are areas with new accident and emergency departments, such as Limerick and Kilkenny, while areas like Galway, based on the current timeline, could be four or five years waiting for a new accident and emergency department to open.  Will these infrastructural deficits have an impact on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Is the timeline too long and will this have an impact?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and will take his questions in order.  The reprofiling of health spending is very interesting.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has just finished a benchmarking exercise in respect of where Ireland sits in the international context.  It was quite difficult to do because we include disabilities, mental health and other definitions in our spending, whereas other jurisdictions do not.<\/p> <p>  I take the Senator's point on mental health and I am very happy to say we advanced significant funding to Jigsaw during the pandemic.  Jigsaw is represented on our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation advisory council.  We are very aware of the work it is doing.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about community healthcare networks and how they link with primary care settings.  The community healthcare networks are really interesting from a population planning perspective.  They will be able to predict the needs of a population of an average of 50,000 people and adjust the services needed for the population.  The primary care centre's role is critical in that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about GP buy-in.  We have a very engaged working arrangement with GPs and we meet every three weeks.  We have agreed a programme of work with them that also includes looking at future strategies for GPs, especially in the terms of the topics raised by the Senator, including recruitment in a rural setting.  That is a major issue for GPs.  We have also agreed to fund the benchmarking and monitoring of the chronic disease management that GPs will be doing.  They have kindly agreed to work in close partnership with us in healthcare pathways, which is a very interesting system.  I will ask Ms Mellett to elaborate on that if we have time.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about relief for GPs in the context of Westdoc.  We have a very interesting initiative happening this year with advance triage and this is being funded by the National Ambulance Service.  If people are anxious during the night they can phone up and be directed either to a service that is local or in a hospital, with the goal being to have this staffed by GPs.  We look forward to working with the ambulance service in rolling that out, as it is a very exciting initiative.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Cro&iacute;, which we have funded.  The work it has done on heart failure is one of the projects we have been delighted to fund.  The Senator is absolutely right that this is fantastic work.  It is something we will look at in terms of scaling.  The example I gave during the presentation was a remote heart failure clinic that is being run by Kilkenny and St. Vincent's hospitals.  There are slots available for GPs to phone in and get a senior consultant's advice on whether a patient is doing well.  It is a case of not bringing in people as an outpatient but having the expertise available on tap.  The new ways of working we have been able to explore during the year are exactly what the Senator inquired about.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Healy to speak about community and voluntary organisations, which are a key part of our engagement.  We have been very fortunate to have the support of the community and voluntary sector in the work we are advocating.

These are a means of documenting the current approach to a particular condition, set of symptoms or patient cohort.  They are agreed by relevant health professionals and adopted to local circumstances.  The initial focus for implementation is around the interface across primary care, community care and social care with the acute sector.<\/p> <p>  With regard to benefits, this is really about building integration between primary care and secondary care.  It allows clinicians to drive service improvements.  In countries where a similar approach has been implemented, they have found that not only does it help to identify the current approach but it also helps to identify gaps where services could be improved so people can work together.  It allows a greater level of standardised care.  This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it is quite the opposite.  A minimum standard is agreed on the basis of the resources available in each region or area.  That results in a reduced variability of care, providing a better patient experience through more timely and consistent care.<\/p> <p>  The key purpose is to support GPs and others providing care in the community in order to provide more care away from the hospital setting.  It gives information to GPs in order to support them in making more decisions when the patient is sitting in front of them in the general practice.  I will not go into too much detail but I should say GPs are very strongly in favour of this approach and we are working with a broad range of stakeholders to try to implement this approach with our colleagues in the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Mellett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The involvement of the community team in the voluntary sector is very significant for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare right across the board.

Cro&iacute; was a good example.   We have also been working with local mental health services and vulnerable groups that have their own representation, such as LGBT Ireland which works with LGBT people and the needs they have.  Such organisations may offer care for older people or those with particular vulnerabilities.  Having partnerships between medical professionals and voluntary groups is very important.  It is particularly important to move towards the delivery of care as close to home as possible and in the community in order to reduce the footfall into acute settings.  We have found that many people prefer to be cared for at home or with their local community supporting them.  It is an important delivery.

To build on what the previous speakers said around networks and so on, as well as to reassure members regarding general practitioner, GP, buy-in and so on, there were extensive discussions with GPs and other staff groups as part of the 2019 agreement to secure their buy-in through the relevant unions. The discussions involved taking that agreement forward and the development of the networks.  As my colleagues have stated, voluntary groups are an integral part of the local network arrangement.  The whole point of what we are trying to get towards with populations of 50,000 is that we can do things more locally and join things up in a much more straightforward manner than one can nationally or regionally.  This initiative is very positive in that space.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about infrastructure and whether it is limiting step in this context.  Obviously, there will always be more demands for capital and resources in general than there are resources available, but I assure members that we have robust prioritisation processes in place to ensure that all the capital resources we have are directed to maximum value, such as investing in additional equipment or new buildings or tidying up existing buildings and so on.  There is a process to address issues that arise.  The Senator mentioned the issue of front door capacity.  For a combination of reasons, that issue would receive a high rating in any prioritisation process.  It would be daft for us, given the budget outcome yesterday around some of the revenue funding and so on, to have everything lined up in terms of an ability to put additional capacity on the ground but then find that we did not have the kit for staff to use or a safe, modern and appropriate building for them to work in.  We work very hard to ensure the revenue and capital sides of the house are very closely aligned.  One of the reasons the service planning process we will conclude in the coming weeks is being taken forward in parallel with the capital planning process is to ensure the two join up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank Ms Magahy and Mr. Sullivan for their opening statements.

That is why in the winter and pandemic plans we sought to secure extra resources to help close the gap in terms of lost capacity.  We have been successful in that regard, which is fantastic.  At this time, it is inevitable that there will be an impact in terms of the timeline for bringing in the Sl&aacute;intecare targets.  It would be a big ask in terms of treatment, those waiting for inpatient or day case care and so on, to even hope that those targets would be reached.

Regarding Sl&aacute;intecare and the organic nature of it - this question is for Ms Magahy - 50 or 60 years ago we had an institutional setting, particularly for matters such as mental health, if that is not a misnomer.  Then the emphasis was to move it - it continues to be to move it - into the community.  However, Deputies and Senators, as constituency representatives, have known that there was significant pressure on the provision of community care in the home and in other community settings.  What has been learned with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare?  For example, if this is not the only pandemic we ever experience in our lifetimes, what has the team learned about trying to deliver continuous care to people in their homes in a safe way?  How much is the inability to deliver it safely due to the provision of items such as adequate PPE?  Specifically, things like respite care would be a priority for a small number of parents in the constituency as they are under so much pressure.  The numbers relating to the provision of respite care are significantly reduced, which means the parents of adult children or children with special needs are the ones who have probably carried the greatest burden outside of front-line staff during the pandemic due to their inability to access this.  What stops them accessing it?  It seems that the provision of proper PPE would be one part of it.<\/p> <p>  There are two parts to that question.  It is my last question in this five minutes so the witnesses have time to respond to it.  What lessons have there been regarding the provision of community health, be it is people's homes or in other community settings?

When services were being delivered in a different way, such as physiotherapy, we have learned from some of our integration funds that people who were able to respond to a programme of activity online were helped by it, although it did not suit everybody.  As people began to learn to live with the disease, it became possible for people to visit other people in the home.  That does not counteract the social side and it does not counteract children missing going to school, meeting their comrades and the rhythm of every day.  If the thinking is that this will go on for much longer, the model of care for people with disabilities needs to be thought about.  This also applies to older people who would be used to going to day service settings, people with Alzheimer's disease and those caring for people with Alzheimer's disease, etc.  It is a significant burden for people who are caring for loved ones.

I think Deputy Durkan and I are the only two who were on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which addressed Sl&aacute;intecare.  I cast my mind back to those cross-party deliberations over an 11 month period with 14 Deputies.  The issue that came up most frequently during those deliberations was the fact that the organisation of the HSE is disjointed and incoherent.  At a time when we are supposed to have integrated care and integrated budgets, the HSE had seven hospital groups, nine community health organisations and God knows how many mental health teams and other structures.  There was no coherence whatsoever.  Members unanimously, as well as the vast majority of people who came in to give evidence, identified this as a key problem in how we deliver services.  There are hospitals doing one thing and community services doing another, and never the twain shall meet.<\/p> <p>  There was a strong recommendation from that committee that we needed to co-ordinate all of that and restructure it with a regional structure so that we would have a number of regional organisations, perhaps six, that would include hospitals, community and all other health and social care services.  There would be a single budget for each of those regions and a single management structure so that decisions could be taken on the spending of money in the best place.  If it was more economical and effective to spend money on community services rather than expensive hospital services, then that money could be redirected, and there would be coherence and value for money.  That was taken up, it was in the final report and it was accepted by Government, but I gather it has now been put on hold.  That is really disappointing because that was a key recommendation.  Unless we get that kind of coherence about the structure, the budget and the management accountability for the delivery of services and the spending of money on a regional basis, we are just going to continue with the HSE being amorphous, with nobody knowing who is in charge or where accountability lies.  Is it the case that that has been put on hold and, if so, why?  When are we likely to get back to implementing that key Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to elective hospitals and Ms Magahy has responded to this to some extent.  In the witnesses' consideration of that, are they considering the potential purchase of a private hospital, as happened in Edinburgh, to kickstart the shift to elective-only hospitals?  I know the witnesses are in touch with Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital.  There is plenty of space there and potential to develop it as an elective orthopaedic hospital.  Is that on the cards?<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the two key objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One was to shift activity away from hospitals to the community so there would be better health outcomes and value for money.  The other was to remove cost as an obstacle to people accessing care, because we are the only country in Europe where people have to pay the full amount to see a general practitioner, physiotherapist or such.  Is there any funding in yesterday's budget to remove cost?  It seems to have slipped down the agenda.  We have not heard anything about better, cheaper access to GP care, community care or medicines.  Can we expect anything out of the budget in that regard?  Affordability is an important element of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#F00500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was about the regions.

It is in the programme for Government.  The reality of what has happened is that we had a joint working group which Mr. Sullivan and I co-chaired.  We had worked out a high level programmatic approach for the implementation, which was concluded in February of this year, then Covid hit.

It is in the programme for Government and we consider it as a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  There was a Government decision on the geography of the regions and a commitment to come back with a business case that clearly outlines the rationale, costs and risks in ruling out these regions.

The more detailed announcement on the details of health spending was at noon today, so we are all missing that now.  Regarding GPs, there will be access to 136,000 additional diagnostic tests in 2021 and the medical card eligibility will be extended to those aged over 70 years, with 56,000 people benefiting from that measure.  From November 2020, there will be a reduction in prescription charges for those aged over 70 by 50 cent to &euro;1 per item, and by 50 cent to &euro;1.50 per item for those aged under 70.  That will benefit about 1.5 million people who have medical card eligibility.

We are not there fully, but we are getting there in respect of costs being removed as a barrier.  What is really important for the next stage, within the context of community healthcare networks, is that we will be able to plan and look at how people move between hospitals and the community.  The eligibility roadmap must be looked at in that context.  There are some oddities in that regard, for example, someone with a medical card will be entitled to services in primary care, whereas people without a medical card might be referred to an outpatient waiting list.

Having the ability to look at things on a regional and population basis would assist in doing that because that is not as clear now.  I say that because as people move between community services and hospital, their care journey is paid for by different parts of the system.  Some parts might be paid through the GP, some through community services and some through hospital services.  It is not always possible, therefore, to see what the total journey of care is for people who move between the settings.  There are, however, very robust systems within the HSE.

One of the things that struck me from the briefing note was in respect of the national clinical lead for trauma services.  In 2019, work was done in that area and staff were appointed.  Particular work was done in Dublin hospitals regarding their submission to become trauma centres.  An implementation group was also set up to oversee that.  With the proviso that the ambulance service and how it operates is always a hot topic in Dublin, can the committee get a progress update on the work being done in Dublin hospitals?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that there is a huge amount of work involved in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is not only about the move to primary care but also the treatment of chronic illnesses in the long term for citizens.  The latter is a major concern and has a massive impact on people's quality of life.  An issue that has been raised with me by a few groups, and by the Asthma Society of Ireland in particular, is the creation of registers.  The Asthma Society of Ireland has reported that some of its members who attend medical services encounter difficulties in being recognised as having the condition they have.  This is also relevant in the context of people with diabetes and epilepsy.  There do not seem to be programmes for registers in Ireland, although they are quite prevalent in other EU countries, even those that operate under the constraints of GDPR, which I am sure is a concern when it comes to data collection.  I would like to understand if the creation of such registers has been considered.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we have talked about capital funding today.  This is a very important issue and I hope that the budget which has just been announced will help in that area.  We have talked a great deal about elective procedures and the possibility of accessing capacity in private hospitals.  My question concerns the community care side and relates to a much smaller-scale aspect of capital funding, particularly in the context of disadvantaged communities.  I refer to the Healthy Ireland programmes and those lifestyle and well-being benefit programmes that are listed in the briefing note.  I would like to understand what the decision-making process is regarding capital funding as it relates to those programmes.  Are we trying to find bricks-and-mortar facilities to house those important community programmes that relate to illness prevention and, if so, where are we with that work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#H00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Mr. Sullivan can perhaps answer the question relating to the work done in trauma because he has been very involved with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I am happy to answer that.

That includes the implementation of the trauma centre system and investment in the national ambulance service, which will be linked to it.  That is good, because the work can now progress with some money behind it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the creation of registers.  I am pleased to say that one of the innovation projects that we have funded is to create a register for diabetes, which we have not had before.  It is being compiled at the moment.  In the context of registers for other conditions, it is interesting that the Deputy referenced the Asthma Society of Ireland because it is represented on the Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council.  In discussion with the Asthma Society of Ireland and others, it is recognised that sometimes people have many chronic illnesses.  For example, they may not just have asthma but also heart failure issues or diabetes.  I am told that the difficulty in creating individual registers is the issue of people being on multiple registers.  With the roll-out of the individual health identifier, however, that can be streamlined.  There will not be a need for individual registers for individual conditions; there will be an individual health identifier, so the condition can be linked to the person, which is better than just having a register.  With the agreement with the GPs and in the context of their management of chronic disease, which is paid for, we will be beginning the data collection process with them. The opportunity to roll out this chronic disease register is part of that work and has already been agreed.<\/p> <p>  The issue of Healthy Ireland is interesting because it is clearly operating, physically, through primary care centres through the Making Every Contact Count initiative.  However, it is also operating at a wider level through local authorities.  Almost every local authority now has a Healthy Ireland co-ordinator and plan.  As recently as yesterday we were talking with the local authorities about a resilience campaign relating to mental and physical health, which will be coming on stream before the end of the year.  In the context of the area-based disadvantage approach to Healthy Ireland whereby certain people are particularly disadvantaged, there is specific funding in place for a very exciting programme that can be implemented and rolled out next year.<\/p><p>There are now 135 primary care centres operational around the country.  Many of them are top of the range, new infrastructure and will house the more than 2,000 primary care staff who will be recruited next year.  There are great opportunities to link health and well-being.  In terms of prevention it is about keeping people well in the community through primary care centres and GPs and avoiding hospital through chronic disease management in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions in what is a very difficult time for everybody.

I acknowledge that the question is quite broad.  It is my understanding that Sl&aacute;intecare aims to achieve universal healthcare and to dismantle the two-tier healthcare system we have currently.  Some people will level the aforementioned charges at Sl&aacute;intecare and I am interested to hear what the witnesses have to say in response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#J00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that great question and I am sure it is one that was widely debated when the Oireachtas committee was formulating its report.  There is an absolute commitment to a universal health system and to separating public and private care.  The objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is to build and reinforce the public infrastructure, including staffing levels, and that is where the majority of today's funding is going.  Sl&aacute;intecare does not say, interestingly, that there should be no private care but that there should be a separation of public from private.  In looking at how that would take place, the de Buitl&eacute;ir report last year recommended a series of steps.  Critical to implementation is a new public-only consultant contract which will come into play from January next year.  In public hospitals consultants can only provide public care and no private work will be permitted.  That will separate the public and the private and make the differentiation between the systems much clearer.  If a patient is in the public system, he or she will get care in public hospitals by publicly funded staff.  That is a very important initiative.  There are 300 consultant posts funded at &euro;250,000 each in the budget that was announced yesterday and they will be rolling out next year.<\/p> <p>  There will always be some resistance to reform but what we have seen is that people are very willing to come on board with the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare.  They were obviously very well considered when they were written because they are things to which people can sign up and the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are understood by everybody.  The delivery of them will be nuanced, depending on people's perspective.  We have certainly found, and Covid has demonstrated in spades, that when people see the bigger picture and see where they fit within it, they are willing to go with it and are pleased to do so.  They like that leadership and vision.  I would say that has held and that the budget, to be honest, is a lever of change.  The budget today will ensure that this aspect of Sl&aacute;intecare is implemented at speed over the next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602630000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>To build on what Ms Magahy said, Sl&aacute;intecare is actually quite specific on issues such as expectations around waiting times in emergency departments in hospitals of four hours and waiting times for scheduled care services, as we discussed earlier.  It states very clearly that people should wait no longer than ten weeks for an outpatient appointment, 12 weeks for treatment and ten days for diagnostics.  It is also very clear about the expectation of and need for universal access to healthcare that is free at the point of use.  It is also very clear about the direction of travel in terms of delivering care as close as possible to the patient's home and about trying to support people to live healthy lives at home as independently as possible.  There is nothing in there that any of us here or among the population at large could argue with but the challenge is giving life to that.  We have made reasonable progress over the first couple of years, as Ms Magahy has described, and I hope that progress really accelerates in the next 12 to 18 months.  In that context, the budget is a very welcome step in the right direction in terms of supporting the pace of change.

We are well on the road towards doing that and every year that goes by we are advancing towards it.  As I said earlier, the budget is a lever of change but it is not the only lever.  We still need structures to support the changes and critically, we need e-health and the people to support them.  Quite honestly, one of the biggest challenges will be recruiting the numbers of staff envisaged, which will be funded by the budget.  As we know, it takes years to train professional staff and unless they are in the pipeline, we will not have them ready to switch on.  That is going to be one of our biggest challenges.

I have one question with two parts.  Like Deputy Kenny's question, I am dealing with high-level or blue sky thinking.  Obviously Covid-19 has had an impact on every part of our lives but particularly in the health sector.  The witnesses have already alluded to this but how will the Covid-19 crisis affect the Sl&aacute;intecare plan?  Ms Magahy said that she wants to see this done in a couple of years but we do not have an endpoint for the realisation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  When the National Health Service was set up, people in Britain were told it would be done by a certain date and that was the end of it.  When one does not have an endpoint, it is a little bit easier to extend and move things around.  What impact will Covid-19 have on our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plans?  Is that a bit like asking how long is a piece of string?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in two issues in particular, one of which is weariness among those working in the sector and the other is change management.  A key element of this is buy-in from those who are going to be rolling it out.  Weariness and burnout are pervasive and get into people's core.  This is an issue for healthcare workers most of the time but Covid-19 has exacerbated it.  Is the office engaging in strategic planning on how to deal with weariness and burnout in the sector?  If the people rolling out the programme are not able to do it because they are exhausted, that will knock Sl&aacute;intecare on the head.  Is there long-term planning around the knock-on effects of Covid-19?  Those effects will be society wide and include issues with people's physical and mental health, undiagnosed illnesses as well as delayed diagnoses.  We have a shocked system and a shocked population.  We do not yet know what the long-term implications will be but we know that people are missing out on diagnoses and so forth.<\/p><p>How does Ms Magahy see that impacting upon those timelines?

The Senator is correct, in that even when Sl&aacute;intecare is done, it will require continuous improvement on an ongoing basis because nothing is ever finished.  If we can manage to put in place the structures, systems, staffing, training and e-health, then the architecture of Sl&aacute;intecare will be complete and it can continue iterating and improving thereafter.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct to say that there must be burnout in the system after Covid-19.  It has been an incredible onslaught for people working in the system, both those working on the front line and those managing the pandemic.  Colleagues in the HSE and the Department have been at the forefront of this in recent months and have been working unbelievable hours to try to deal with something they had not expected and do not fully understand, as nobody does.  They have shown incredible resilience in doing so.  I must say that people need hope that a better system is coming, that it is funded, that there is a plan for it and that they can see that things will get better.  An indication of the need to fund that is that there is money in the budget for well-being for staff, and a particular programme of activity will be implemented in this area by the HSE.  Therefore, there is recognition that there is an issue in terms of burnout and people being worried, as well as a programme being implemented in that respect.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also raised the issue of the wider societal impact of Covid-19, and the unknowns that exist.  Some very good planning has been done through the clinical care programmes within the HSE and the Department in trying to anticipate and put in place specialist hubs in the community for people who have been impacted by Covid-19, particularly in the areas of respiratory and mental health.  This will entail putting place more mental health supports for young people, older people and the staff of the health services and systems.  Therefore, a good bit of anticipatory work has been done and has been factored into the community healthcare planning.  When we started, we talked about community healthcare networks linking with primary care teams and specialist hubs for older people but now, there are also specialist hubs that will be focusing on the downstream effects of Covid.  We do not know what will happen until we have a vaccine and things get better next year at some point, but people need hope that the system is going to change and that they will be a part of that.

If one takes Cork as an example, a number of sites are clearly suitable for the development of a new elective hospital, one being in Sarsfield Court, which has more than 100 acres and is owned by the HSE.  My understanding from Ms Magahy's comments this morning is that while a proposal will be made to the Government by the end of the year, that proposal will not identify the preferred site of development.  I am confused about timelines in this regard because if the plan does not identify the site, we will spend another six to 12 months identifying a site, another two years trying to get planning permission and a further three years building the hospital.  I am confused that although there is an area in which no new hospital bed has been provided in the past 30 years and which has experienced a huge growth in population, we seem to be pushing paper around without any clear answers.  Four weeks ago, I asked the Minister for an update in writing.  What Ms Magahy has presented to us today is not in writing.

An analysis has been carried out by the HSE of its budget.  The barrier to full-time recruitment is the knowledge that ongoing funding would be required for the posts.  Going back to the detail of today's budget, there is a commitment to many thousands of ongoing posts on a permanent basis, which should obviate the need for agency staff in a significant way.  It is good news that we are now able to recruit more permanent staff and to invest in the public system.<\/p> <p>  When we hear about beds being funded, we are talking about the staff.  It is the staff who are being funded, not the beds.  The beds come from the capital plan.  The issue is the staffing of those beds.  As we are aware, in intensive care units, ICUs, a five-time ratio is needed in order to provide full-time care for a patient.  That is a massive investment in nursing staff and in other healthcare professionals in hospitals and in the community.  Whether it is community beds, hospital beds, ICU beds, residential beds or neurorehabilitation beds, the big cost is not the beds, it is the staff.  What is in the budget today will allow us to plan on a multi-year basis and not just fund things on a temporary basis.  Traditionally, when we fund services for winter, which is a bizarre concept anyway, we have been turning services on and then turning them off.  One cannot hire people on that basis because they cannot commit and hospitals cannot commit to the training and the ongoing service.  When full-time funding is given for these positions it will reduce the need for agency staff and will put in place the permanent workforce that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020101400002#L02000","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Okay.

Having waited this long, I will try to exert what little influence I have.  We need to change the system a little.  Committee meetings are long and drawn out and this room is extraordinarily cold.  I am freezing to death down here, but perhaps it is only this part of the room.<\/p> <p>  I will take written answers to the following questions.  St. John of God's services are being discontinued from next year.  What preparations are being made for the replacement?  When will know exactly what it is and will it be sufficient to meet the requirements?  Those requirements are growing as opposed to otherwise.<\/p> <p>  What stage are we at with cervical cancer screening and bringing that up to date with the results of tests and continuous screening?  To what degree are patients continually informed, do they have to wait or are they asked to wait longer?<\/p> <p>  There are huge gaps in the system relating to child mental health.  That is worrying.  I have never seen it so bad.  Are there imminent signs of putting a system in place that responds adequately to the level of demand in respect of child mental health at the present time?<\/p> <p>  For children with special needs, such as those with autism, are there any plans to ensure continuity of services and various therapies and that there is not a tail-off?  At the moment, if a therapist goes on maternity leave there is no service for the child, which is a huge break and setback to the treatment level because the patient or child then regresses.

I want to ask about the same issue Deputy Durkan raised regarding children with special needs.  Mr. Sullivan spoke about recalibrating and remodelling how we deliver services.  During Covid, many of the hospitals and services we bought in such as Citywest were not being used and people said that was a missed opportunity to deal with some of the waiting lists.  Have we learned from mistakes that were made in the past?  Mr. Sullivan said in his submission that 98% of Sl&aacute;intecare projects were on track in June 2019.  It is now October 2020, so after seven months of Covid, what level of disruption does he estimate has been caused to that timeline?<\/p> <p>  As Deputies and Senators, we hear about the delayed diagnosis issue all the time.  For orthodontics or children with braces, the delays are years in some cases.  For ophthalmics, eyesight issues, or cataracts, people have to travel to the North in many cases.  In some cases they wait years or possibly worry about going blind.  Deputy Durkan also talked about kids with special needs waiting.  In CHO 7, which covers both our constituencies, children are waiting up to two years, or even two and a half, to get an assessment.  They then might have to wait another two and a half years to get speech and language therapy and so on.  We are talking in terms of 12 weeks to get into the system.  People at home want to know what is being done to fix the services that are clearly broken the areas we have outlined in those questions.  I do not know if the witnesses have time to answer as we only have a few minutes.  Perhaps they can come back to us.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the witnesses who did not get in and have waited patiently here throughout the session.

On the disability assessment of need, there were a huge number of people waiting for it.  I am very familiar with this matter because we were able to forward &euro;8.7 million to clear those backlogs just three weeks ago.  We are awaiting details from each of the CHOs around the country on how they are going to clear those backlogs in a matter of months.  That funding is there for them to take up.  It is a significant amount of funding which is supposed to clear that whole backlog.  That is very good and means there will be a new disability network manager system where children will be referred in to get treatment directly in the disability networks.  Those people are now in place and they will be able to do their work with a clean sheet and without a backlog of people waiting.

Can we redeploy some of the LEADER staff to work with those businesses to assist them to apply for restart grants, trading online vouchers and so forth?  If we did we could maximise the drawdown of the funding by local businesses that sometimes are the last people to know about support or the last to draw it down.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the presence of Ms Sheenagh Rooney, Assistant Secretary, Department of Rural and Community Development who is assisting us here today.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#A00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the Deputies for the question on LEADER.  I am sorry that I must leave a bit earlier than expected but, as members will know, there is a meeting of the Cabinet.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the LEADER programme, more than 3,400 projects were approved by the end of September that are worth &euro;135 million.  By the end of this year I expect the local action groups, LAGS, to have approved the full &euro;169 million available for project funding.  In 2019, the outturn was &euro;45 million with an allocation of &euro;40 million for 2020.  Activity on LEADER continued throughout the Covid-19 crisis and there is a spend of &euro;32 million to the end of September.  I expect that the outturn may again hit &euro;45 million.  I will deal with extra demand placed on the fund from savings under the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, programme.  Some projects, under the RRDF programme, have been delayed most likely due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>Almost &euro;100 million in project payments will remain to be made over the 2021 to 2023 period.  The project approvals under the current LEADER programme will finish at the end of this year.  The next programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest, due to delays in agreeing the overall EU budget.  However, project funding under the current programme will continue.<\/p><p> While the final announcements will be at the end of this year, it will take some time for the funding to be drawn down and the different projects to be delivered.  The staff in the LEADER companies will work with the promoters of these projects to ensure they are delivered.<\/p><p> The transitional regulations are still under negotiation but I am aware of the need to ensure smooth transition between programmes.  When I had the honour of being in this office previously, we had the exact same transition programme.  I accept there is uncertainty among the staff in the LEADER companies wondering whether they will have a job.<\/p><p> The Chairman is correct that it is important that the LEADER companies and their staff be fully utilised.  I expect they will be in finishing off this programme.  I am expanding the local employment services in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I hope LEADER companies will take the opportunity to deliver some of those programmes.  The Deputy referred to restart grants and trading online vouchers.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been doing amazing work across the country.  They have additional resources.  Businesses should go to their LEO if they are wondering what they should do about Brexit or Covid supports.  They will certainly give them the help they might need.<\/p><p> The LEADER staff will be quite busy rolling out remaining programmes.  I secured an additional &euro;4 million in the budget for the LEADER budget.  The total allocation for next year will be &euro;44 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#A00800","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The interim money up until now has always been purely administrative money to keep the staff in place.  There was a certain expectation this time that Exchequer moneys would be provided to ensure projects could be approved in the two years.  It will be two years before LEADER gets going.  Even if the CAP is theoretically ready to rock and roll in 2022, it will not be the case with LEADER.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at the pattern of LEADER expenditure, it will be at a peak now and for the next year.  Then, when the new programme starts in 2023, there will be little expenditure until two or three years into the programme.  As the Minister knows, &euro;40 million a year will be given to it, there will be underspends, and surpluses will be used for better purposes.<\/p> <p>  Some people had hoped that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would accept that we should just level off the money by providing Exchequer funding for the interim period.  If one were sanctioning programmes in 2021 and 2022, they would not become due until 2023 and 2024, which is a fallow period for money demands in the Department.  In other words, one takes the European money when it comes but when it is not there, one provides Exchequer funding.

Category 2 is aimed at giving the seed money so that organisations are ready to apply for category 1.  To date, 63 category 1 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;131 million.

The third call for category 1 projects launched in June is closing on 31 December.<\/p> <p>  Funding through the RRDF has been transformational for rural areas with some strong good projects.  When the applications come in, the projects are thoroughly assessed by an independent panel meaning that some good stuff comes through there.  It will take time to deliver those projects and Covid has led to delays on a number of fronts.  The RRDF has a key role in social and economic recovery.  We expect to ramp up the spending at the end of this year.  Normally many requests come into the Department at the end of the year.  Claims totalling &euro;4 million came in last week.  We prepay where it is warranted.  If we have good evidence that they will spend the money and they need it to help them avoid having to draw down overdraft facilities, etc., we try to work with the project promoters and help them insofar as we can.<\/p> <p>  The latest tranche of the town and village renewal scheme was announced earlier this week.  That was focused on measures to make towns and villages more Covid accessible and Covid-friendly.  Some great projects came in, including outdoor cinemas, outdoor seating and other imaginative stuff.  In this call we decided to include the towns with populations of more than 10,000, which had been left out.  Normally we do not include them because towns with a population of more than 10,000 can apply to the urban regeneration and development fund and we keep the town and village renewal scheme for the smaller towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the town centre first policy.  My Department is committed to developing the centre of towns.  We can make a real difference in the area of remote working.  The budget allocated an additional &euro;5 million to the town and village renewal scheme, specifically aimed at centre-of-town hubs and working spaces.  That will revitalise towns which have plenty of buildings that can easily be adapted for co-working spaces with high-speed good broadband.  I want to work with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the broadband issue.  Based on my experience in my previous Department I want to see more remote working and more investment in the regions and smaller towns.  I will also work with the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We need joined-up thinking involving IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government all working together to ensure we can revitalise town centres.<\/p> <p>  We had a pilot scheme with six towns from various parts of the country.  We have the report from those towns.  Most towns throughout the country have similar challenges and problems.  One of the big problems in the centres of towns is with the old buildings.  We need to find ways to incentivise people to renovate those buildings.  Sometimes when they renovate them, they find the commercial value considerably less than the cost of getting them back into shape again.  We need to work with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on that.  My local town of Clones had a major investment of &euro;5 million through the Department to regenerate some buildings and turn them into top-quality social housing.  It is about bringing people back into the towns either to live or to work there.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will hear me talking about remote or connected working and I hope to work with them on that because it is a game changer.  It was a dream or an aspiration this time last year and now it is a reality.  We need to grasp that for rural areas, run with it and make it happen.  Many people are working from home in their own communities.  We want them to stay in those communities.

There seems to be an absolute passion, a fervent belief that is almost religious, among the great and good of this country that we must ignore the 30% of people who have the audacity to live outside of towns and villages, as the planners see them.  Where I live in Connemara, everyone lives in a baile, which is a town or townland.  They think it is a real town, even though it does not have shops, pubs and churches in it.  They see nothing wrong with living in these bailte fearainn where their people have been living for 2,000 years.  If one looks at the names, one will find that these are very old settlements and are not some creation of the Celtic tiger.

When we are talking about Estimates, these are the fundamental issues we must decide.<\/p><p> We are talking about rural regeneration but I have never yet gone to a meeting in rural Ireland where roads were not number one on the agenda.  Number two on the agenda in more recent years has been fibre broadband in the home.  I know this is not the direct responsibility of the Minister but when we are talking about rural development, we must know what her priorities are for all of rural Ireland, including the 30% of the total population that lives outside rural towns and villages.  What are the priorities for those people?  Is it the policy of the Government to drive them out of the countryside?<\/p><p> Finally, I got a chilling answer on the Flemish decree case, a planning ruling of the European Court which holds that states should either permit virtually no housing in rural areas or else have an absolute free-for-all, which we all oppose.  How does that fit with the Minister's overall responsibility for rural areas?  What interaction is she having with the Department with responsibility for planning?  There is no point in her saying that she is going to develop rural Ireland when other Departments are totally taking the legs from under her.  There is no point if the Department of Transport is not providing money for roads, if funding for water for people who are dependent on wells is not provided and broadband is not being rolled out fast enough.

There will be a sea change following Covid-19 in terms of people working from home but they will also need to be connected to where they work and we will need a combination of both.  In terms of supporting and enhancing rural Ireland, these elements will all have to come together.  We cannot just deal with broadband with no connection made to public transport or to roads.

There is &euro;88 million in total, with &euro;53 million for the RRDF, &euro;25 million for the town and village renewal scheme and &euro;10 million for the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cuiv's point.  I understand the needs of people who do not live in villages or towns, the needs of somebody who lives in the heart of a parish in Aghabog, for example, on a farm.  I am delighted that my daughter is now building a house on the family farm and will continue that tradition and I want to protect people who want to do that.  It is only fair that such people get the services they need including broadband, water and electricity.  We have to help them and do so through a number of different schemes, particularly the local improvement scheme, LIS.  There is &euro;10 million in the LIS and I have secured an additional &euro;500,000 for next year.  That might not sound like a lot but it will assist with those lanes that badly need to be done.  I accept what the Deputy said about transport but we do have the Local Link service which helps to connect rural Ireland.  We have some very good local services in that regard.  I know my own constituency best where a service runs from Cavan to Monaghan five times a day, over and back.  It brings young people to institutes of further education and is a fantastic service.  We need more of that and we must fund more local public transport services.<\/p> <p>  I visited Glenasmole with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, recently for the launch of the broadband connection points initiative.  There will be 300 such points right across the country.  Glenasmole is at the foot of the Dublin mountains.  I thought that people living in Dublin had all the broadband they wanted but I discovered that they do not have it out in Glenasmole.  When I got there I saw so many similarities to where I live.  Sometimes we have the wrong idea in rural Ireland; we think that everyone in Dublin is connected but that is not the case.  I take Deputy Paul Donnelly's point about a blend of working from home and from hubs or offices.  People need connectivity to link in with their employers but it is also important for their mental health to get out of the house.  When people are working from home all day they have a starting time but it can be hard to find a finishing time.  It is better for people to be in a work environment that has the right furniture at the right level, the correct lighting and so on.  I am concerned that some people who are working from home are sitting on chairs that may cause back injuries or other problems.  Companies will be able to come together in these connection point buildings, enabling their employees to work remotely.  We must support that, manage it and provide that service because it will make a difference.  We have also invested a great deal of money in cycleways and walkways in rural Ireland so even if people live in the countryside they will be able to get on their bicycle and go into the local village to work.  This is something to which we should all aspire, namely, people not always needing to use their cars.  Often in rural Ireland, people need not one but two cars.

That is like saying that to be eligible for a scheme in the city two of the workers would have to be involved in the high-tech industry.  The vast majority of people living in rural Ireland today are not involved in agriculture.  It is unnecessarily restrictive.  I would say \"yes\" if it stated that they had to be permanent dwellings, not holiday homes.

It already has a temporary facility there but there is a need for a temporary Coast Guard facility and Cleggan is the ideal place.  It should be remembered that the airstrip there means Sikorsky helicopters have no problem landing.  They can land on the apron, never mind landing on the airstrip.  What are all these codes and arrangements?  It would drive anyone crazy.  The answer from the Department of Transport states: \"Under the Public Spending Code, OPW have to evaluate all potential sites in the Cleggan area.\"  The Minister's Department owns this site.  It is an airstrip and the Coast Guard uses a Sikorsky helicopter.  The boat is a rigid inflatable boat, RIB, on the back of a jeep.  It is fine where it is.  It is within one mile of the sea and the Coast Guard could have to travel ten or 15 miles by road before getting to the pier nearest to an incident.  It already has a temporary facility but now we are told that there has to be a big study to prove that no other site is available.

Now, after being closed for months, they are operating at 30% or 40% capacity.  The funding that is coming in would help to bring them up to a level where they are at least able to offer the minimum wage, if not the living wage, but it will be a massive challenge over the coming year.  I am really concerned, as are the organisations themselves, about how they are going to do that, bearing in mind that we are at level 3 and the infection rate numbers are not great.  I hope we do not go any higher than level 3 but there is a possibility that we will.  The organisations in question are worried about that and will have to take it into account when making their projections.<\/p><p> My second point relates to the overall programme.  We should be looking at bringing it up to minimum wage and then allowing any the excess profits that are made by particular projects to be pumped back into bringing people up to the living wage.  Not all of the programmes are at the living wage level but it is the minimum we should expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#F02500","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I have several points to make regarding subhead B12.  First, until a few years ago, participants in the schemes under the community services programme, CSP, were paid the full minimum wage by the Department and the latter also paid the employer's PRSI.  In what I thought was a very mean cutback, that was changed and now there is a contribution from the companies to the participants' wages.  Second, the companies also used to get a grant for general overhead costs, which was not needed by some of them but was needed by others.  The grant funding was tailored to prevent surpluses building up in some companies.  In the context of the Covid crisis, it is extremely important that money be made available for overhead costs.<\/p> <p>  My third point concerns the CSP companies that have suffered a severe income loss or had to close because of level 3 restrictions.  A lot of these organisations are either community centres or heritage sites.  Many heritage sites throughout the country are in community ownership, including, for example, the Dunbrody visitor centre, several sites in Donegal and Athenry Castle in County Galway.  Will those organisations be entitled to apply for the new scheme announced yesterday by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation?  Has there been any discussion with the T&aacute;naiste as to whether they will get a grant if they have to close because of the level 3 restrictions, which many have had to do already?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the fourth issue I wish to raise, it would have been helpful if the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, were still here to respond to it.  Departments tend to organise their affairs as if they were all competing football teams, not part of the same Government.  Any of us who have had the privilege of serving know that they look after their money and will always try to prevent it going to another Department.  I got into big trouble as a Minister when I helped another Department by moving people from community employment, CE, schemes onto a scheme operating in my Department, thereby freeing up CE places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, should put it to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that the net cost of creating more jobs under the CSP would be quite small given the huge savings it would bring in jobseeker's allowance and other payments, depending on which scheme people are on.  It is much easier to ask a Minister to take money out of his or her left pocket if one is going to put it back into his or her right pocket, although the departmental officials will still fight over it.  Even though there are two different Departments involved, at least it is the same head.<\/p> <p>  The State has invested big money to keep some community centres open from 8 o'clock in the morning until late at night post Covid and every one of them needs that money.  A lot of good new community heritage projects have been set up that will not be economic in themselves but will operate as loss leaders in their communities to attract people into all the other businesses in those communities, including bed and breakfast accommodation, restaurants and so on.  Does the Minister of State have plans to persuade the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to support these enterprises rather than having people paid to do nothing, which is very bad in terms of their morbidity?  People who are long-term unemployed tend to die younger, go to the doctor more often and take more medicine.  That is a scientific fact and it is nothing about the people themselves but simply because humans were not built for being idle.  Giving such people a meaning in their lives will bring them significant benefits.  The most frequent queries we got during my time in the Department were not about people being put on schemes but about people being put off schemes or trying to get on them.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State undertake to have a discussion with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and ask that she achieve a little saving out of welfare by transferring, say, 500 people to some of the new projects operating under the CSP?  We need to ensure that every large community centre in the country has the wherewithal to sweat its assets by being able to open all day.  Every heritage centre, including the new ones being developed, and other facilities, such as those for Travellers, should automatically be eligible for the fantastic programme that is the CSP.  The reality is that most of the people on these schemes will not get commercial jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#G00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I will try to answer all of the questions but members might let me know if I miss any of the specifics.  The CSP is a bit of a hotchpotch made up of a whole variety of different types of organisations throughout the country.  There are loosely three strands to the programme.  The largest strand, and the one members are probably most familiar with, includes a large number of community centres and heritage sites but also some organisations, like FoodCloud, which are quite different in their function.  The second strand is focused on social inclusion services.  The smaller third strand is specifically about creating employment for people who are the furthest from the labour market.  That is a very loose description of the three strands and there is a wide variety of organisations within the CSP.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows, the genesis of the programme was in an effort of pulling together different strands from different places.  Some organisations are general social enterprises and others not so much.  A lot of the work was started in the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment many years ago.<\/p> <p>  In the context of defining the current operation of the programme and its purpose, we asked Indecon to conduct a review of the CSP.  I signed off on that report and it was published a couple of weeks ago.  We are now starting a process of reforming the CSP for a variety of reasons, one of which is to ensure it fits into our five-year community and voluntary strategy.  The CSP, as it has been operating, was not very strategic and it was not very clear what exactly it was for.  It was, broadly speaking, about making sure that certain organisations, all of which were doing good work, got funding.  The Indecon review identified a need to be more strategic about the purpose of the programme.  To that end, one of the things we are likely to do is seek to tailor the funding and application processes for the different organisations and make the application process easier.  That work has already started and we are setting up a consultative group, which will include managers from the CSP organisations, community centres, the Irish Local Development Network and The Wheel, to discuss how we can reform the programme.  This Friday, I am meeting a number of managers from a variety of CSP organisations to ensure I stay in touch with what is happening in communities and the range of activity in this area.<\/p> <p>  I will try to address some of the specific questions that were put to me.  Some 20 or 30 organisations are in the pipeline to join the CSP.  One of the reasons we want to reform the programme is that there are lots of organisations that want to be included in it.  The idea is that for at least some of the participating organisations, they would be in the programme for a period of time and would then move on to function as social enterprises in their own right.  That has not tended to happen because of the way the scheme is currently set up.  Organisations get the funding and want to hang on to it and stay in the programme.  That approach is suitable for some organisations because it what they need and what we need to do for them.<\/p><p>There are approximately 20 or 30 in the pipeline.  Currently, we have stopped new entrants because we will be restructuring next year.<\/p><p> As the Deputy spoke about meals on wheels, an interesting point occurred to me.  Through my Department, Rethink Ireland had a &euro;5 million social innovation fund for Covid-specific responses.  As part of that, it has given a small grant to Irish Rural Link to co-ordinate meals on wheels at a national level.  It is a small grant but it is a big job to co-ordinate that process at a national level but it is something that might be of interest to the Deputy as the programme was mentioned.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Paul Donnelly, our view on funding is that we contribute a portion of the salaries of people who work in the programme he mentioned.  This was born out of an initial contribution some years back of what was the minimum wage.  It has not increased since and the Deputy has made a fair argument that it should be increased.  With regard to funding priorities, I am very concerned, like the Deputy, that some of these will not be able to stay open next year.<\/p><p> I can tell the Deputy in a straight and honest way that my priority in the budget negotiations was this as well.  The last thing I want to do is see any of these organisations that are so crucial in what they provide to communities around the country shutting next year.  It is in that context that we fought for more funding and we got &euro;2 million specifically to help organisations like that get through next year.  It will be difficult and many of these organisations depend on traded income, hall and room rental, which is just not happening now but overheads are still mounting.  We had a &euro;1 million support fund this year as well to help organisations get by.<\/p><p> I mentioned before that there is a bit of a natural rate of attrition as well and some organisations just do not fit the model we have.  Some fall out of the scheme and some decide to leave to go in a different direct.  We certainly do not want any organisations closing because of Covid-19.<\/p><p> I am trying to cover everything mentioned by Deputies as best I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#G00300","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I had a question on applications for business grants and so on.

I could not get my head around it at all.<\/p><p>I do not know how many people we are severely damaging by forcing them to be available for work or actively seeking work but unable to get work.  For all sorts of reasons, there are people who are unlikely to ever get a commercial job.  Any of us on the ground with their people knows this.  I ran a community co-op that had a commercial side and a scheme side.  There were people happy on the schemes but not on the commercial side and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  That is just life.

I have mentioned subhead B11, the community enhancement programme, on several occasions.  A grant of &euro;2 million has been made.  I know of two community centres in my own community that are in need of 40% of that.  One is at risk of closing because it is in such poor condition.  It is one of those community centres and parish halls that are not local authority-run.  If a facility is run by a local authority it can get funding there, but a substantial number of groups must apply for community enhancement programme funding.  Perhaps other members know how many groups are in that position.  They get it in dribs and drabs.<\/p> <p>  Hartstown Community Centre sent me an absolutely brilliant business plan outlining operations in the next year, three years and five years.  The problem is that the centre has no guaranteed funding other than its own.  The Wheel and other organisations have raised the issue of multi-annual funding.  Multi-annual funding provides assurance.  If an organisation goes to a bank or credit union with a business plan, it can point to a facilities fund sponsored by the community enhancement programme that guarantees a certain income for the next three years.  It can then use that assurance to take on some risk.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, these community centres open in the morning and stay open as long as they can.  They try to open seven days a week to facilitate local dance groups, musicians and sports groups.  It is vital for the fabric of our communities that we keep all of these centres open so that the community can use them.  I am concerned because there is significant pent-up demand for funding.  Many of these facilities were built 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  A cr&egrave;che might offer a community centre a certain amount per year to rent the premises.  That is brilliant income, but Tusla is likely to rule that children cannot be cared for there under any circumstances because there are no proper fire doors, fire alarms or whatever.  Either the improvements have to be made, which costs an astonishing amount, or the centre must turn the business away.  In some cases, cr&egrave;ches have been there for years, but Tusla applies new rules demanding that massive changes be made or operations stop.  That rent is a big chunk of guaranteed income that enables community centres to subsidise dance clubs, football clubs, singing groups, karate clubs, etc., without charging commercial rates, which many clubs cannot afford.  I am very passionate about this issue because I know the effect it could have if centres cannot operate without that work being done and those managing the centres decide they cannot take on &euro;200,000 loans as personal risks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#J00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State responds to these points, I note that the community enhancement programme was also used to install defibrillators, which have been of great benefit to communities.  However, there is a lack of joined-up thinking in this regard.

I know of a social enterprise in my constituency that would be prepared to assist with training and the capital cost of boxes for defibrillators throughout the country.

Huntstown Community Centre also received &euro;45,000 under the Covid-19 stability fund for community and voluntary, charity and social enterprises.  The community enhancement programme is similar to the local improvement scheme in that it is not an enormous fund but there is huge need out there for it.  Funding is allocated to local authorities, which each receive a certain amount.  When that is divided up again, the amounts are smaller still.  The local development companies within local authorities make decisions on the funding.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on multi-annual funding.  Coming from the community and voluntary sector myself, I know it is the golden ticket that enables organisations to plan.  It does happen on some occasions.  One of the main objectives of the five-year community and voluntary sector strategy I am overseeing is to facilitate more multi-annual funding for organisations across the community and voluntary sector.  That is a big job.  If we achieved some of it over the next few years, it would be a big win.  The Deputy's point that community centres have major needs for upgrading, structural works, etc., is well made.

Volunteering was structured and organised fantastically through Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>We overcame one issue, which always has puzzled me.  I worked previously for Tusla, and in one year I was Garda vetted on five occasions.  I was smiling in respect of the volunteer list.  I wondered how we were going to get those people vetted, including some in our club who had been Garda vetted, albeit for GAA activities, and others who had not been Garda vetted at all because they were parents.  Then, miraculously, it happened.  While I know this is not the Department responsible, Garda vetting is very important in the context of volunteering.  I hope it will be possible to have a conversation with the relevant Department regarding the creation of just one certificate.  In other words, when being Garda vetting for 2021, I refer to the ability to bring evidence of that vetting around to other organisations so that it is not necessary to repeat the process continuously.  Having to do that puts people off.  It frustrates them, slows down the process greatly and is a major issue in respect of volunteering.  We have a wonderful history of volunteering and that really was on display during the Covid-19 crisis through the numbers of people who were willing to help.  I had nearly 90 people on a list, who were willing to go out every day to shop, to collect medicines from pharmacies or to cut grass or whatever was required by older and vulnerable citizens.  I would welcome some co-ordination in the system about volunteering and how it might be possible to get one certificate and to avoid wasting Garda time with vetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#J00700","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I will start with a straightforward and simple question.  Is the Covid-19 stability fund exhausted or will there be further approvals of allocations?  My second question is also straightforward.  Does the Minister of State have responsibility for dormant accounts and can he tell me the total amount of money in the fund, net of the statutory reserve that must be kept and of any money kept aside for projects that already have been allocated funding?<\/p> <p>  My third question refers to something not in the Estimate and which I regret disappeared from it in 2012, namely, the RAPID programme.  It was set up to deal with what are, scientifically and sociologically, based on census data, the most deprived communities in the country.  Every one of those communities was an urban one.  I never buy the argument that any rural communities are as deprived - and I take the whole meaning of the word \"deprived\" - as are some of the urban communities in this country.<\/p> <p>  The idea was that we would build a big wall around those communities in respect of funding but not anything else.  This was because, as we have seen in the past, more affluent areas are much better able to grab the money.  All sorts of people, outside of the relevant areas, get money for community development within deprived areas but sometimes that can be queried.  The RAPID programme had some interesting characteristics in that regard.  There was an area implementation team, AIT, on which people who actually lived in local authority housing had guaranteed representation.  The Garda and the VECs were also included, as were other organisations.  <\/p> <p>  Money was given by the Department.  That meant that if community representatives, who actually lived the reality of life in an area, did not sign off on proposed projects, such as playgrounds, for example, those projects would not happen and the Department would not pay.  In any co-funded scheme, therefore, the local representatives were the people with the ultimate choice as to whether a project would go ahead.  The counter veto was with the local authority in respect of its half of the funding.  It was necessary, therefore, to get both sides to agree for a project to go ahead.  That type of set-up, however, stopped the domineering effect of people from the outside always telling people in more disadvantaged communities what was good for them.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, dormant accounts money totalling &euro;100,000 was also being given every year for small things.  It went through the AIT and it spent the money.  There was again specific ring-fencing in respect of the power of the community representatives.  For the first time in their lives, they were part of the decision-making process.  That meant that it was not always somebody else making their decisions for them.  For whatever mad reasons, which I have never understood because these are, scientifically, the most deprived communities, this focused and targeted scheme was abolished.  All I got in reply to parliamentary questions as to why that happened was a load of raim&eacute;is. <\/p> <p>  It seemed to me that some interests got at this programme because they did not like it.  Local authority managers did not like it either and that was because somebody else could ensure that the money was spent.  Places like the Oliver Bond Street flats complex, which was in the news recently, saw great friendships created.  For the first time, people in places like that had a real say in what was happening.  They were at the table as equals and they had their share of the money.  Other people did not then always have control of the money, because the local people had their veto as well.<\/p> <p>  It is not the Minister of State's fault that the programme does not now exist because he is new in the Department.  I am glad that he comes from the voluntary sector.  It seems that three of us here come from a background in that sector, or perhaps the five of us present do.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the RAPID programme as it was in its heyday, taking into account the psychological empowerment that came with that programme.  We are always talking about empowerment and we were giving real control to people in that programme.  Will the Minister of State look at that model and consider whether it should be reinstated?  I have never believed there was a valid reason to get rid of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#K00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  While we are on subhead B3, the senior alert scheme has been very successful.  I see this year that &euro;5.3 million has been allocated for it.  Again, however, no more than in the case of the defibrillators, we could do much more with that money regarding the types of devices we are providing to older people.  When we are connecting people to the Internet, we could provide them with a laptop or a smartphone, and combine monitoring and communication in the senior alert scheme.<\/p> <p>  I refer to providing mobility in this context, because, thankfully, older people today are not physically confined to the home.  They are at the moment, sadly, because of Covid-19, but otherwise many older people are often outside.  Having a device connected to a mobile network, in respect of an alarm or a fall, means that an alert can be triggered by someone in a field in the middle of nowhere, out in a park or out for a walk on the street, instead of the fixed scheme existing now.  We could achieve much more by using the technology that exists, rather than using what is now old technology. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#K00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I will address that issue briefly.  To my knowledge, there are plans for higher technology devices to come on stream.  I need to confirm that but I recall that there were plans in that regard.  The lot option for the forthcoming scheme in 2021 has been confirmed, along with the technical specifications for the telecoms equipment to be included.  Work is ongoing at interdepartmental level to explore the potential amalgamation, in the medium term, of the senior alert scheme into broader assistive technology schemes operated by the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There has, therefore, been some thinking on this issue, and it looks like there will be some sort of product at the end of it.  There is definitely great potential in linking up with other technologies and other needs.<\/p> <p>  If the committee does not mind, I will go backwards and address the questions from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I have been thinking about how to empower communities and give them a voice at a grassroots level and how that was done in the past.  That was one of the first things I started thinking about when I got the job.  I have also been talking to organisations about this matter and how it might be done.  <\/p> <p>  We got new funding, albeit a small amount, of &euro;1 million yesterday to start some pilot schemes next year with a view to growing this kind of approach again.  I come from the sector and know how valued that approach was.  I acknowledge that it has dissipated or diminished over time and in the past ten to 15 years especially.  This is, therefore, a small measure being undertaken to try to restart that approach in a small way.  Many good things have also happened in the same period, however, particularly concerning the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  As I know it is not perfect, this is about finding spaces for it to develop.<\/p><p>I have been thinking about it and there will be something happening on it next year.<\/p><p> On the question relating to the Dormant Accounts Fund, I do not have all the figures that the Deputy asked for, but the 2020 action plan was approved with more than &euro;45 million worth of measures included, &euro;12.6 million of which rests with the Department of Rural and Community Development, and the remaining &euro;32.4 million is spread across eight other Departments.  I will look into getting other figures for the Deputy.  <\/p><p> We obviously dipped into the Dormant Accounts Fund substantially this year for the stability fund, which I can talk about because I have some figures with me.  The majority of the moneys have been disbursed.  Approximately 560 organisations received grants from the fund.  There is not a lot left and some applications are still under appeal.  However, the good news on the stability fund is that an additional &euro;10 million has been allocated to the fund in the budget, which is to be used before the end of this year.  We are in the process of figuring out how best to use it, because we have to do it quickly and use it by the end of the year.<\/p><p> On the issue of Garda vetting raised by Deputy Donnelly, it goes into the broader issue of volunteering.  I am pushing to bump up where volunteering sits in the national psyche and in the community voluntary sector.  There is huge potential and a significant volume of good work is being done, but it needs a framework, direction and proper funding.  Those things are happening, and I am glad that we will publish the first national volunteering strategy before the end of the year.  Without revealing too much of its contents, there is an action included in respect of Garda vetting.  The issue of Garda vetting is a problem not only for the volunteering sector.  I know that it is also an issue for sporting organisations, and it can be frustrating to have to repeat the process of vetting, so there are wider issues to consider.  However, in respect of volunteering, Garda vetting is on the list of issues that we need to address. The policy on volunteering will be coming out and there has been a significant increase in funding from &euro;3.5 million to &euro;5.1 million next year.  This will allow us to finally open a volunteering centre in every local authority area.  Currently eight areas do not have a centre.  At the end of next year we should have a full national network of volunteering centres, which is crucial for many reasons.  The evidence is that if people want to volunteer and can talk to a professional about it, they are much more likely to follow through rather than just send an email and hope something happens.  If people sit down with someone in a volunteering centre to discuss the options and the support framework, they will be more likely to volunteer.  It was one of the big positives that came out of yesterday's budget that I was glad to see.  We will be able to put volunteering on a much more solid level and will ultimately develop a national volunteering corps.  <\/p><p> Covid-19 really has shown the value of volunteering.  Committee members will be well aware of this but people are still helping at Covid testing centres through volunteering, both informally and through volunteer centres.  The ESRI is engaged in research which seeks to measure the value, reach and scope of the community call initiative, which continues at local authority level.  All the local authorities are meeting this week because the country has moved to level 3.  That research is trying to measure the value of community call and I will be interested to see what value we can take from it and what can continue, and how we can support that engagement from local organisations and volunteers to help people in their communities that need it most.  I think that broadly covers most of the questions asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020101400002#K00400","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602630000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Before we go any further, we have 16 minutes left.

A strategic decision made somewhere to take community development out of the community and put it into local authorities and partnerships.

We had community development workers in community centres working on the ground, and the then decision was made to withdraw them to office work, and a connection was then lost.  It coincided with the diminution of RAPID and AIM.<\/p> <p>  The question I wish to ask relates to the Mulvey report on the regeneration of the Dublin north inner city, for which &euro;6.5 million has been allocated.  It goes some way back to RAPID, because the north inner city is a very disadvantaged area.  I read a recent report on Darndale, written by Jack Nolan, who is a retired assistant Garda Commissioner.  It is a very similar situation to the north inner city where there have been serious issues with gangland murders.  Darndale is close to my heart because I worked in Coolock for almost 19 years, I know the place really well, and I knew some of the young people who were killed last year.  I am wondering how the funding was allocated to implement the recommendations of the Nolan report.  When I read the report on Darndale, I did not see a reference to a co-ordinating group.  There are many tasks for different agencies, but I could not see one group to oversee the work.  However, there is a co-ordinating group in respect of the Mulvey report, and &euro;6.5 million has been allocated to it.  How does that happen?
