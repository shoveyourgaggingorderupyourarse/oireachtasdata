Well over\u00a0half of all the public transport trips are by bus; some\u00a0136 million passenger journeys annually.\u00a0 It is no\u00a0surprise then that Bus is\u00a0the main component of the planned approach to\u00a0addressing our current congestion problem and to meeting our future transport needs. <\/p>  <p>  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region. On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are currently only in place for less than one third of the corridor.\u00a0 This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.<\/p>  <p>  Against this context, the NTA are progressing the roll-out of BusConnects commencing in Dublin. BusConnects Dublin provides the foundation to this overall transport system, with the revised bus system projected to carry the majority of passengers across the region and provide key linkages to serve the needs of Dublin into the future.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by:<\/p>  <p>  - building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus\u00a0routes\u00a0to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and\u00a0reliable;<\/p>  <p>  - completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide passengers\u00a0with a more\u00a0efficient network, connecting more places and carrying\u00a0more people;<\/p>  <p>  - developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and\u00a0debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and\u00a0making\u00a0payment much more convenient for the travelling public;<\/p>  <p>  - implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up\u00a0passenger\u00a0boarding times;<\/p>  <p>  - revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure;<\/p>  <p>  - allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public\u00a0transport services, without\u00a0financial penalty;<\/p>  <p>  - implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system;<\/p>  <p>  - rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information, and\u00a0increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and<\/p>  <p>  - transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using\u00a0 low-emission vehicle technologies.  <\/p>  <p>  NTA are aware that maximising the potential of the BusConnects project means enabling more people to use the bus services instead of private cars. For those travelling longer distances, the optimum strategy is a park and ride arrangement, where they can make part of the journey by car, then leave the car in a dedicated car park and complete the journey by bus. For people travelling longer distances, often the optimum strategy can be\u00a0a park and ride arrangement, where they can make part of the journey by car, then leave the car in a dedicated car park and complete the journey by public transport.\u00a0 Bus-based Park and Ride needs careful siting of the car parks, coupled with a high frequency of bus service, to operate successfully. Ideally, the location of the parking facilities should be just outside the area of congestion and conveniently located for car users on the particular corridor<\/p>  <p>  As part of BusConnects, a network of park and ride facilities will be developed at key locations along the radial road network. Indicative locations were published in 2017 on the basis that these would be subject to more detailed assessment as part of the project&rsquo;s delivery and may change and that additional locations may be added. In June, the National Transport Authority published the Core Bus Corridors Project report setting out the outline of 16 radial routes, together with 200km of cycling lanes, into and out of the city. In October of this year NTA expect to publish the detailed and considered proposals for each of the 16 corridors. At that stage a full public consultation process will commence. This will allow people to provide feedback and their thoughts on the proposals and the NTA will fully engage with people along the corridors and surrounding areas. Once this phase is complete and the design finalised, NTA will turn their attention to confirming the detail of network of park and ride facilities will be developed at key locations along the radial road network.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, it is envisaged that BusConnects will deliver a bus system, fully integrated with Park and Ride facilities to ensure a seamless connection between the parking facility and the bus system, \u00a0that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann Services","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[37879\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress of the Bus &Eacute;ireann review of services in the Ballincollig area; when recommended changes will be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[37705\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of proposals made by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the NTA to improve the bus services 220\/220X and 223 in Cork.","asker":"1223","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 47 together.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.\u00a0 I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.\u00a0 Deputies will understand that the operation of Bus Eireann services is a matter for the company with oversight by the NTA.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has entered into a contract with Bus &Eacute;ireann for the provision of bus services in the State.\u00a0 In accordance with the terms of that contract, the day to day operation of those services is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann.\u00a0 The Company is required to meet performance obligations in relation to service delivery such as punctuality, services operated, vehicles in service and customer information.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has invested in a significant improvement to subsidised bus services in Cork City.

On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.\u00a0 This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by:<\/p>  <p>  - building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus\u00a0routes\u00a0to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and reliable;<\/p>  <p>  - completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide\u00a0passengers with a more\u00a0efficient network, connecting more places and\u00a0carrying more people;<\/p>  <p>  - developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit\u00a0and\u00a0debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and\u00a0making\u00a0payment much more convenient for the travelling public;<\/p>  <p>  - implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up\u00a0passenger\u00a0boarding times;<\/p>  <p>  - revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure;<\/p>  <p>  - allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public\u00a0transport services, without\u00a0financial penalty;<\/p>  <p>  - implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to\u00a0the new bus system;<\/p>  <p>  - rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information,\u00a0and\u00a0increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and<\/p>  <p>  - transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using\u00a0low-emission vehicle technologies.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo;. This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex, is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes. Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit their full potential. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking.<\/p>  <p>  The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. <\/p>  <p>  While there will be concerns with any change, these strategies will deliver many benefits for the customer; much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure; provide more frequent all day services through new and frequent orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines. <\/p>  <p>  Under these proposals, an overall increase in services of 27% is expected, which as far as customers are concerned, can only be a good thing. The NTA estimate that\u00a0 of people who currently have a direct service to the city centre about 92% will continue to have a direct service under the new\u00a0bus proposals.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, it is envisaged that BusConnects will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before,\u00a0support\u00a0the elderly and people with disabilities in their travel, \u00a0and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test Data","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[37702\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900063#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of driver testers located in each county in each of the years 2015 to 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>The following table outlines the number of driver testers operating and headquartered by County for each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Well over\u00a0half of all the public transport trips are by bus; some\u00a0136 million passenger journeys annually.\u00a0 It is no\u00a0surprise then that Bus is\u00a0the main component of the planned approach to\u00a0addressing our current congestion problem and to meeting our future transport needs. <\/p>  <p>  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region. On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.\u00a0 This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.<\/p>  <p>  Against this context, the NTA are progressing the roll-out of BusConnects commencing in Dublin. BusConnects Dublin provides the foundation to this overall transport system, with the revised bus system projected to carry the majority of passengers across the region and provide key linkages to serve the needs of Dublin into the future.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by: <\/p>  <p>  - building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus\u00a0routes\u00a0to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and\u00a0reliable; <\/p>  <p>  - completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide\u00a0passengers with a more\u00a0efficient network, connecting more places and\u00a0carrying more people;<\/p>  <p>  - developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit\u00a0and\u00a0debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and\u00a0making\u00a0payment much more convenient for the travelling public;<\/p>  <p>  - implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger\u00a0boarding times;<\/p>  <p>  - revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure;<\/p>  <p>  - allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public\u00a0transport services, without\u00a0financial penalty;<\/p>  <p>  - implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system;<\/p>  <p>  - rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information and\u00a0increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and<\/p>  <p>  - transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using\u00a0low-emission vehicle technologies.<\/p>  <p>  As well as providing many benefits to exisiting and future bus customers, BusConnects Dublin is\u00a0calculated to also provide over 200km of cycle lanes as an integral element of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In July\u00a0the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo;. This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex, is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes. Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit their full potential. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking.<\/p>  <p>  The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is\u00a0aware, the NTA supported by Dublin Bus have embarked on a process of full public consultation\u00a0 on these bus proposals involving local brochures, local face to face events organised at various locations around the city, digital imaging of the network, on-line surveys and consultation with user groups. They are both\u00a0 listening to people who have suggestions as to how these plans can be made even better.\u00a0 The public consultation process will run until 28th September and presents a great opportunity for people to have their say before the plans are finalised by the NTA. The NTA expect to publish the finding from the public consultation phase before the year end. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the consultation process, I am advised that the NTA has also engaged with disability groups, facilitated by the National Disability Authority, with regard to the BusConnects proposals. The NTA understand that the issue of interchange is more difficult for elderly people and people with disabilities.\u00a0 Accordingly, it intends to make changes between services as seamless as possible.\u00a0 NTA are planning that each key interchange location will have a bus shelter, seating, lighting and passenger information.\u00a0 Where bus routes intersect at a junction, the bus stops will be moved as close as possible to the junction to minimise any walking required during the bus interchange, and pedestrian crossings will be added where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I understand an overall increase in services of 27% is expected, which as far as customers are concerned, can only be a good thing.\u00a0 The NTA estimate that, of people who currently have a direct service to the city centre,\u00a092% will continue to have such a service under the new proposals.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am\u00a0well aware of concerns raised by people at the Information roadshows and at\u00a0local meetings. Area specific issues raised at public consultation will be\u00a0looked\u00a0at again by both the NTA and Dublin Bus when the consultation period is over. While\u00a0the proposed network is a significant opportunity to continue the growth of bus services,\u00a0it will be a huge change for everyone in the\u00a0city. However, the objective of the proposals is to provide a bus service\u00a0that is easier to use, understand and more attractive to customers and to\u00a0potential customers - to make the network more efficient, with frequent services and access to more places.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude,\u00a0BusConnects is an innovative proposal that\u00a0is getting people to think\u00a0about how they travel.  I\u00a0am satisfied \u00a0that BusConnects will\u00a0deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900064#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":96,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Road Network","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900064#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[37816\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900064#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if additional funding will be allocated to local authorities for their road works programme in 2019 in view of the importance of the non-national road network particularly in rural counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[37815\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900064#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a substantial increase in funding for the non-national road network in 2019 will be ensured in view of the need for additional investment in this network in areas such as counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 46 together.<\/p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of local authorities, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

The Memorandum included elements aimed at moving from planning to implementation in a number of key areas and the Government requested detailed follow-up proposals, including in regard to the recruitment of customs officers and staff responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary checks.

Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions.  The first two of these have commenced operations in recent weeks.  A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint.

Similarly, the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the incident referred to by the Deputy, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner, and was the subject of a High Court order directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it. The removal of individuals from the property was not conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order. <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to facilitate the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest. I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed initially and were later supported by a Garda Public Order Unit.<\/p>  <p>  The execution of High Court orders is not a matter which falls within the remit of the Private Security Authority. The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court made under them, and any dispute in relation to the enforcement of a Court Order is solely a matter for the Courts. <\/p>  <p>  I note Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s recent statement in relation to the protest and he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I understand that this review will include an examination of a particular vehicle involved in the removal of the persons from the premises, as well as any other associated Road Traffic Act offences that might have occurred. I also note that the Policing Authority will be pursuing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. <\/p>  <p>  The right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy, and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, it is also a right that must be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others. In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were enforcing the law of the land in what were very difficult circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, there has been some disquiet about members of the Public Order Unit wearing hoods.  The Commissioner has said they should have been worn in conjunction with helmets and you will be familiar with public order police around the world wearing helmets in the course of their policing duties.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad fact and a worrying development that Garda&iacute;, and particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest itself, the Garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident, racist abuse and I condemn that behaviour. Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all. I would appeal to people to recognise that Garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be targeted in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900065#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900065#WRC06000"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[37951\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900065#WRC06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; in each of the years 2010 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly,\u00a0since 2014, 276 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Public Appointments Service (PAS)\u00a0have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise running recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing , while recognising the value of a Garda Reserve, has recommended that recruitment to the Garda Reserve should be paused, pending the outcome of the Strategic Review.

Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated, but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all.

Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organ Donation","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[37901\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of plans to implement a national opt-out organ donation policy; his views on whether this needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>The\u00a0General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill is being finalised at present and will be submitted to Government for approval shortly.\u00a0<\/p><p>The proposed legislation will include provisions for a soft opt-out organ donation system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD05000"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[37922\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of plans to publicly fund the treatment Spinraza for persons with spinal muscular atrophy here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[37948\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900066#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when persons suffering with spinal muscular atrophy can expect to have the drug nusinersen approved for reimbursement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 104 together.<\/p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

As a consequence, no passenger licences have been issued which include Inishmurray on their plying limits. It was recommended that no such licences be issued until such time as the appropriate landing facility has been provided. No passenger boat licences have been revoked due to this issue and those passenger boats which have the appropriate licences may approach the island so that passengers may see the island and take photographs. <\/p>  <p>  It was brought to the attention of the MSO that certain boats were advertising trips to the island and as such may have been operating outside the terms of their passenger boat licences. As safety regulator, the MSO has a responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers and officials of the MSO contacted the owners of these vessels to remind them of their obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Further to my response to Parliamentary No 464 on 3 July 2018, I wish to make\u00a0clear that this issue relates to the issuing of passenger boat licences. A passenger boat is defined in the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 and includes a boat carrying up to 12 passengers for reward or while carrying up to 12 persons to or from their place of work. It would not include persons using a boat by themselves or while carrying friends or family as non-fare paying passengers. Such vessels may be considered to be recreational craft which do not require passenger boat licences but may still be subject to other regulation. My Department recently updated its code of practice on the safe operation of recreational craft.<\/p>  <p>  The solution is the provision of an appropriately safe landing facility. This is a matter for the owner of the property on which the facility would be built and the appropriate local authority, which in this instance is Sligo County Council. Once an appropriate landing facility is provided, officials of the MSO can assess it and any passenger vessel proposing to use it with a view to granting the appropriate licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900068#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900068#WRF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[37941\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900068#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has received correspondence from a person (details supplied) regarding development of lands at Harristown, Dublin Airport; his views on the grievances outlined in the letter relating to accusations made regarding his departmental officials and officials of Aer Rianta; the actions he and his Department have taken to address these concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Office received the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.

The LDA will act as a new commercial State body to actively manage development land with two primary objectives.  <\/p>  <p>  - The first objective is to ensure the optimal usage of State lands, coordinating their regeneration and development and opening up key sites not being optimally used, especially for delivery of new homes.<\/p>  <p>  - The second objective is to drive strategic land assembly through mechanisms that will bring together both public and private sector interests in ensuring the timely preparation and release of strategic land for development in a counter-cyclical manner. Such counter-cyclical action will be aimed at stabilising any tendency towards volatility in development land values, securing more of the increase in such values as a result of the planning and infrastructure investment processes for the common good and thereby driving increased affordability through better and more cost-competitive land availability.<\/p>  <p>  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  The LDA has been established, with three staff members initially rising to five in the weeks ahead and rising progressively thereafter, in line with the expansion of its development lands portfolio.  The expectation is that the Agency will have some 25 staff when fully operational. Staffing of the LDA will be focused on securing experienced personnel in the areas of planning, construction and development, project management, finance, procurement and law. <\/p>  <p>  Now that it has been established, the LDA is in the process of advancing agreements with various State bodies in relation to a range of sites, with the Housing Agency, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Defence participating in the first tranche of land agreements. A detailed business plan for the LDA is currently in development and will provide additional information on its delivery programme.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, to support the work of the LDA, the Government has agreed new policies requiring that 30% of public lands coming forward for redevelopment and or disposal are to be reserved for affordable housing purposes, in addition to the statutory requirement for 10% social housing under Part V provisions, ensuring more housing supply at affordable prices and rents.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is advancing the preparation of primary legislation to underpin the LDA in the longer term, replacing the Order under which it has currently been established.  It is expected that a General Scheme will be published later this Autumn with a Bill being published in early 2019, ensuring that the LDA has a clear mandate and sufficient powers, including in relation to compulsory acquisition if that becomes necessary, to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900069#WRG04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Administration","counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900069#WRG04500"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[37925\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900069#WRG04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if changes to the housing assistance payment model will be made in order to speed up a process (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>I refer to the replies to Question Numbers 270 of 27 June 2018, 589 of 22 May 2018 and 625 of 8 March 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The position in relation to the processing times for Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) applications remains unchanged.
