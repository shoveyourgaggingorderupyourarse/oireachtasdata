While I, along with my cabinet colleagues, continue to closely watch developments in the UK, my Department continues work to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit.  This work, at national and EU level, continues to intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  Central to all planning scenarios, the maintenance of rights and privileges under the Common Travel Area (CTA) will protect much of the valuable and rich cooperation which takes place between education on a North-South and an East West basis.  My officials have engaged with colleagues in the Department for Education in the UK on a set of principles which are designed to maintain and build on this cooperation. I am working closely with my Cabinet colleague, An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to conclude this process.  It is important to note that, notwithstanding the type of Brexit, the CTA will be in place.  <\/p>  <p>  Naturally, I do not wish for a Disorderly Brexit, but prudently, I am preparing for this.  As part of my Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Government Contingency Action Plan, an amendment to the Student Support Act 2011 has now been included as one of the parts of the proposed &ldquo;Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill.  This will facilitate the continued payment of SUSI grants to Irish students attending UK and Northern Irish higher education institutions and to UK and Northern Irish students studying in Irish higher education institutions. <\/p>  <p>  As well as that amendment, I also recently announced that EU fees would continue to apply to UK students and Northern Irish for the 2019\/ 2020 academic year.  This brings certainty to UK and Northern Irish students who can be assured that the EU fees will apply for the duration of their studies in Ireland.  However, equally important, both of these actions will ensure that Irish school leavers seeking to pursue their higher education in the UK and Northern Ireland will have certainty as they are making their CAO\/ UCAS choices at this time.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor all Brexit developments very carefully and I can assure all stakeholders in the education that the contingency planning is being constantly refined to substantially reduce risks arising from Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200058#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200058#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[2741\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200058#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when he expects works to commence on a new school building for a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The major school building project for St. Patrick's is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning, Stage 2(b) - Detailed Design, which includes the application for statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.   This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in response to your specific query I can advise that, in the first instance, parents should discuss their concerns in relation to their child or young adult with the Principal of the school involved with a view to discussing his\/her response to interventions in place and the appropriateness of involvement of the NEPs psychologist for individual input including assessment. <\/p>  <p>  However the Deputy will be aware that access to a range of specialist and therapeutic services for children with developmental issues fall within the ambit of HSE services and therefore her question, depending on the specifics,  might more properly fall to my colleague the Minister for Health for response. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200058#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":85,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 answered with Question No. 53.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200058#WRB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[2644\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200058#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for increased current and capital investment in the provision of special autism units in schools in Clondalkin, Dublin 22 and Lucan, County Dublin to meet the significant level of need in those areas.","asker":"1215","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>The policy of this Department is that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels.<\/p><p>The greater proportion of children with ASD attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. <\/p><p>Special class placements are provided in mainstream schools for students with ASD and more complex needs, where it has been demonstrated that he\/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports.<\/p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.<\/p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>Since the 2013\/14 school year the NCSE has increased the number of ASD special classes from 511 to 1196.

The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence\/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  <\/p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides. <\/p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at:.<\/p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.

These actions are also illegal, deeply unjust, and provocative.<\/p>  <p>  With the political process as such essentially frozen, Ireland has for some years focussed its efforts on the Middle East issues, both in the region and at international level, on trying to combat or mitigate these destructive and\u00a0inhumane policies. We have discussed these aspects here in the\u00a0Oireachtas on many occasions.<\/p>  <p>  Locally, in the region, Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU. I have done so myself on my visits to the area. During my visit in July 2017 Ireland joined\u00a0a number of other international partners in the West Bank Protection Consortium, a grouping where we seek to work together to protect Palestinian communities. Irish and other EU representatives have visited threatened communities and attended legal hearings related to their cases.  Ireland also funds Israeli and Palestinian NGOs engaged in defending these communities.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, the\u00a0European Union has taken a number of actions\u00a0relating to settlements. These include the levying of higher tariffs on goods from settlements compared with goods from within Israel's recognised borders, prohibiting the use of EU research funding in institutions located in settlements, and rules to prevent misleading labelling of goods from settlements as being from Israel. Ireland has been to the fore in securing many of these actions.<\/p>  <p>  At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council\u00a0last year, Ireland raised the continued expansion of settlements, and urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. I reiterated\u00a0our concerns about these policies in my speech to the UN General Assembly\u00a0in September.<\/p>  <p>  These actions by Ireland and others have had some effects in halting, delaying or mitigating some actions, but we are all aware that the pressure on Palestinian communities continues and is growing.

The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging and promoting competition and innovation, and the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments. The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing guarantee activities\u00a0that support\u00a0the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs. <\/p><p>The SBCI does not lend directly. Rather, the SBCI operates through its partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers;\u00a0the SBCI currently has three bank and three non-bank on-lenders: AIB; Bank of Ireland; Ulster Bank; Finance Ireland; Bibby Financial Services Ireland and FEXCO Asset Finance. <\/p><p>The SBCI aims to ensure on-lenders and financial intermediaries maximise the benefit and the service provided to Irish SMEs as well as protecting taxpayer money and the investment of both State and European institutions.\u00a0\u00a0I am advised\u00a0that the SBCI is keen to work with any lender, large or small, that can demonstrate it can deliver the required funding advantage\u00a0to eligible SMEs on terms that protect taxpayer money. <\/p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland commenced its activities in March 2015. To the end of March 2018, the total amount of SBCI supported lending activity, including loans made under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee Schemes, was &euro;972 million to 24,002 Irish SMEs supporting 129,300 jobs.

The SBCI continues to work on developing new innovative products, such as the Brexit Loan Scheme, which was launched in March 2018. This &euro;300 million scheme is to provide working capital support to SMEs to enable them to adapt and innovate in response to the challenges posed by Brexit.<\/p><p>Following on from launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme, a Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed to provide long-term investment financing for Irish businesses to help them strategically invest in a post-Brexit environment. There is an absence of financing available for businesses in excess of seven years and the Future Growth Loan Scheme is intended to provide finance of eight to ten years for investment in process and organisational innovation, and investment in tangible and intangible assets on agricultural holdings linked to primary agricultural production.

This credit was introduced in 1991 specifically to assist such parents in the transition from married to widowed status.\u00a0 The estimated cost of maintaining the relief at &euro;3,600 for five years is of the order of &euro;1.7m. This is based on 2016 data and assumes the number of claims for this credit will remain static at 2016 levels. It also does not take account of future economic growth, or the resulting change in income levels, which would have an effect on the taxable income and as a result the ability of taxpayers to fully absorb the credit.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the estimated cost of extending the relief to ten years, at the current tapering rate of &euro;450 per year there would only be 3 additional years before the credit is reduced to zero (&euro;1350 in year 6, &euro;900 in year 7, &euro;450 in year 8). The cost of extending the relief to include the 3 additional years is estimated to be of the order of &euro;5m which would be fully materialised after a period of 3 years, again assuming the number of claims for this credit will remain static at 2016 levels and it also does not take account of future economic growth, or the resulting change in income levels, which would have an effect on the taxable income and as a result the ability of taxpayers to fully absorb the credit.<\/p>  <p>  However, both during and after this five-year period a widowed person with dependent children is also entitled to claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC), in addition to the single personal credit. This ensures that their basic personal credits, before taking into account the additional widowed parent credit, will be equivalent to those granted to a married couple while he or she continues to have dependent children. <\/p>  <p>  Widowed parents who qualify for the SPCCC are also entitled to an increased standard rate band of &euro;39,300. This compares favourably with the single person&rsquo;s tax band of &euro;35,300 currently. This ensures that in 2019 a widowed parent will not be subject to the higher rate of income tax until their taxable income exceeds &euro;39,300.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, widowed persons without dependent children, who therefore do not qualify for the SPCCC or the widowed parent credit, are entitled to the widowed person tax credit of &euro;540 per year in addition to the normal tax credits for a single person.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that widowed persons who are in receipt of the social welfare non-contributory widow&rsquo;s pension are not liable to the Universal Social Charge on that payment. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the significant provisions currently in place relating to the tax treatment of widows and widowed parents are targeting limited resources to where they are most needed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200061#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200061#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[2587\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200061#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he has taken to date and plans to take in preparation for post-Brexit customs checks at ports here, specifically Rosslare Europort; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>The continued free-flow of trade through our ports and airports is a key priority for the Government.

Present figures stand at 1,617 policies, 1,163 of which are currently with the homeowner (these policies were transferred from the developer to the homeowner following completion of the build).  The remaining 454 policies were on houses that were not finished and therefore the policy had not transferred to a homeowner at the time of the liquidation i.e. the policy remained with the developer.<\/p><p>The claims handler (BCR Legal Group Limited) confirmed that its representative CRL wrote to the developers who had purchased these latent defects policies, on two occasions, to advise that Alpha had been placed in bankruptcy, that polices would be cancelled from 11 August 2018 and to request details of the owner of the properties insured under these policies. BCR subsequently wrote to all homeowners affected by the liquidation of Alpha, following receipt of their details from the developers, to advise that Alpha had gone into liquidation, their latent defects policies had been terminated and that they should consider replacing this policy.

The Deputy will be aware that legislation covering Part V obligations has been amended over the years. In many cases, even residential developments currently under construction may relate to older planning permissions granted at a time when legislation provided that Part V obligations could be fulfilled through a range of options, including monetary payments to local authorities, the transfer of land, the construction and transfer of houses on-site, the transfer of houses off-site or a combination of two or more options. I am also advised that, for some NAMA-funded developments, the Part V obligations had already been met prior to the transfer of the associated loans to NAMA.  <\/p>  <p>  The specific means by which Part V obligations are met is the subject of negotiation between the developer and the local authority in each particular instance and ultimately it is for the local authority to determine its preference, based on its own criteria and circumstances. In relation to NAMA-funded projects, I am advised that NAMA does not participate in those negotiations. On a project-by-project basis, NAMA supports and facilitates debtors and receivers in meeting their Part V obligations, however given the broad range of options that have been open to debtors in meeting those obligations in the past, NAMA does not track the overall delivery of Part V obligations which is a matter for the local authorities.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is no statutory obligation on developers to provide affordable homes. Debtors and receivers funded by NAMA are no different in this respect from developers whose funding is from other sources.<\/p>  <p>  I would point out to the Deputy that, since 2012, NAMA has worked with its debtors and receivers to deliver social housing units beyond the requirements of Part V. The purpose of its social housing initiative was to maximise social housing delivery from the assets securing NAMA&rsquo;s loan portfolio. Through this programme, NAMA has delivered 2,481 units directly through approved housing bodies (AHBs), local authorities and its special purpose vehicle, NARPS.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s question in relation to a number of named development sites, the Deputy will be aware that I am prohibited from providing information on specific assets under the control of NAMA debtors and receivers as such information is considered to be confidential by reference to Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of digitalisation on job roles and sectors across the economy in Ireland and to highlight the opportunities and challenges that this presents. <\/p><p>The study consisted of a large volume of desk research and the development of a quantitative model. This was complemented by a number of interviews with policymakers, key informants from industry, representative groups and the Regional Skills Fora, in order to gain insights for the report. The report combines all these elements to provide an assessment of the impacts of digitalisation in Ireland over the next five years, to 2023. It is available online from both the EGFSN&rsquo;s website (www.egfsn.ie) and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.dbei.gov.ie).<\/p><p>The report projects strong overall growth for the economy over the next five years. While the report predicts the number of jobs lost to the adoption of digital technologies will increase steadily over the next decade, it expects that the majority of sectors will employ more people in 2023 than they did in 2018. The report notes that the result of increased digitalisation in the economy will be a slower growth in employment growth, generating a hypothetical loss of 46,000 jobs. <\/p><p>The report further finds that one in three jobs in Ireland are at high risk of being disrupted by the adoption of digital technologies. Much of the disruption, however, will result in changes to job roles and tasks performed by individuals rather than job losses. This means that lifelong learning will become even more of an imperative and the report finds that there will be opportunities for many people to upskill within their current jobs.<\/p><p>The report highlighted how the Government is already acting to address the challenges and mitigate the negative impacts of automation on job numbers. <\/p><p>The report finds that Ireland has the opportunity to place itself at the forefront of digital technologies through ensuring adequate skills provision and capitalising on Ireland's significant ICT sector. It finds that that existing Government policies and initiatives currently in place provide a solid foundation for response to the expected changes from the increased adoption of digital technologies.

Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  For the State as a whole, since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (Q1 2015 to Q3 2018) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment, with 163,500 of these located in the regions outside Co. Dublin &ndash; that&rsquo;s 3 out of every 5 jobs created.<\/p>  <p>  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands has seen good progress, with employment in the region increasing by 17.6% from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. There are 19,100 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015, the start of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process,\u00a0to Q3 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands Region is currently at 7.1% (Q3 2018), which is higher than the State average of 6% and continued focus is therefore required on regional enterprise development and job creation in the Midlands.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) administered by Enterprise Ireland is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. To date the Fund has supported 42 support significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives around the country to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.<\/p>  <p>  Under the REDF first call, I was very pleased to announce that Irish Manufacturing Research CLG based in Mullingar, were approved over &euro;2 million in funding to support the development of this important asset for the manufacturing sector in the region. A further two projects for the Midlands received an allocation under the second call, totalling just over &euro;650,000; namely Mountmellick Development Association and Offaly Innovation and Design Centre (Birr).<\/p>  <p>  The Government\u00a0remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 percent in each region by 2020 and to bring and\/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  That is why in April 2018, I asked the RAPJ Implementation Committees, including in the Midlands, to refresh and refocus their plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, especially in the face of current challenges, including Brexit. This work is ongoing and I expect to launch the refreshed Regional Enterprise Plan for the Midlands next month. The Regional Enterprise Plan will continue to add value to the core mandates of the enterprise agencies by bringing together regional stakeholders to work collaboratively on projects to support enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is also committed to playing its part in the economic development of Irelands Regions. IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in County Westmeath, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are now 42 IDA supported companies based in the Midlands, employing 5,720 people in 2018. This employment figure represents a 14% increase on 2017. The Midlands Region was the highest performing Region in terms of FDI employment growth in Ireland during 2018. The Region has been successful over a number of years in mobilising inward foreign direct investment (FDI), with employment levels in IDA client companies increasing every year since 2011. County Westmeath specifically has performed well with 3,466 people employed in 2018 in FDI companies, an increase of 16.5% over the 2017 figures.<\/p>  <p>  Across the Region, IDA Ireland has a portfolio of Business &amp;amp; Technology Parks available to support IDA and EI client companies. These flagship Business Parks in key locations, including Mullingar, have been designed and landscaped to a high standard and are occupied by many high end manufacturing and international services clients with capacity to facilitate and accommodate new international investment.\u00a0 IDA also works closely with the private sector to encourage and market appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions suitable for FDI clients.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The region has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with particular strengths in Life Sciences, Technology, Global Business Services, International Financial Services and Engineering. Significant &lsquo;new name&rsquo; investments in recent years in both services and manufacturing include Aerie Pharmaceutical, Neueda Technologies (both based in Athlone), SkOUT Secure Intelligence in Portlaoise and Red Seal Cups in Longford. The largest new name project has been Centre Parcs, which is a &euro;233m development in Ballymahon, Co. Longford that will see 1,000 people employed when fully operational in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Expansions of scale from the existing client base over recent years included projects from Ericsson and NPD in Athlone, Abbott in Longford and Avery Denison in Longford.\u00a0 The existing FDI base of companies enjoy strong collaborative links with the Athlone Institute of Technology and the presence of a third level Institute of scale has been key to the development of the Region. <\/p>  <p>  The availability of appropriate property solutions continues to be a strategic asset supporting the winning of FDI. To support the delivery of IDA&rsquo;s current strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019, a &euro;150m property investment plan was announced in February 2015. This investment focus is on the building of Advance Building Solutions (ABS), infrastructure investment in a number of Utility Intensive Strategic site solutions and the upgrade of Business and Technology Parks within IDA's national portfolio.\u00a0 IDA&rsquo;s property investment programme for the Midlands Region included the construction of an Advance Building Solution (ABS) in the Athlone Business &amp;amp; Technology Park, which facilitated Aerie Pharmaceutical in establishing a new ophthalmic production facility and the creation of 50 high jobs. <\/p>  <p>  IDA&rsquo;s focus over the coming two years and beyond is to build on the strengths and competencies of the Midlands Region with a particular focus on high value manufacturing, services and research and development opportunities across a number of established clusters in Life Sciences, Technology, and Global Business Services. Emerging technology trends have and will continue to create new opportunities across the region in areas such as data analytics, smart manufacturing, cybersecurity and new approaches to working such as home working and hub working.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with existing clients to retain and strengthen their presence through continued company transformation as well as pursuing new areas of opportunity for clients companies.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board;<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.\u00a0 In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that residents of nursing homes should enjoy the same levels of support and access to services as when they lived in their own homes. It is of course acknowledged that the reason they require 24 hour levels of support is due to their level of dependency, which in turn will require inevitably access to clinical services including hospital and other outpatient appointments in the community. The HSE provides for a level of Intermediate Care Vehicles, which are used predominantly for non-emergency transport between acute hospitals for admission and discharge purposes. They would be reserved for those who would need specific support in transport and other than that normal transport arrangements apply. These arrangements (e.g. wheelchair taxi) are normally funded by the individual.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200071#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Building Programme","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200071#WRP01600"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[2362\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200071#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the &euro;9 million for a replacement 50 bed unit at the Sacred Heart Hospital, County Roscommon, has been ring-fenced; if the design team has been approved; if the project is still included in the HSE capital plan 2017 to 2021; the status of the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>Following the publication of the Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2019, the Health Service Executive is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2019.

The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described. GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skill set outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions. Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes. The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and\/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process. It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new. Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility. There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process. Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.\u00a0 Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance.<\/p>  <p>  The Best Practice approach as outlined above is endorsed in the Service Development Model as developed by the Quality Improvement Division of the HSE in 2017, in collaboration with TENI. This model is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE. Recruitment commenced to develop these national teams in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0new posts\u00a0includes one consultant endocrinologist (adult services), one consultant endocrinologist (paediatric services), one social worker (adult services), one speech and language therapist (adult services), one senior psychologist (adult services), one senior psychologist (paediatric services), one clinical nurse specialist (Paediatric services), two administrative support officers (adult and paediatric services). This investment\u00a0is a concerted measure by the HSE to address the waiting times and immediate service needs of children, adolescents and adults in transition. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to building mental health, acute hospital and\u00a0primary care services for\u00a0transgender\u00a0children, adolescents and adults\u00a0in accordance with international best practice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200075#WRT03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services Provision","counter":1007,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200075#WRT03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1008,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[2578\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200075#WRT03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he plans to bring forward legislation for safety or exclusion zones around hospitals and primary care centres which provide terminations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1009,"content":"<p>It is\u00a0my intention to introduce legislation to ensure safe access to premises in which termination of pregnancy services may be provided.

Several of the PSI&rsquo;s functions under the Pharmacy Act 2007 relate to education, including promoting and ensuring the highest standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist, and make sure that relevant experience is gained in the course of that pharmacy education and training.<\/p>  <p>  In 2010 the PSI commissioned a review of the five year programme of education and training for the pharmacist qualification in Ireland.  One of the recommendations included the introduction of an integrated 5-year Masters level programme of education and training for pharmacists in line with international best practice, to replace the previous 4 year Bachelor plus 1 year in-service practical training programme.<\/p>  <p>  A National Forum was established to advise and assist the Council of the PSI in its oversight of the development and ongoing delivery of the new fully integrated programme of pharmacy education, training and assessment.  The National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Interim Report of November 2013 noted that it was an essential component of the integrated degree that the student remain a student for the full five years of study.  Under the previous model, students became employees during their final year.<\/p>  <p>  Since September 2015, students commencing their pharmacy education undertake a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master's degree programme in pharmacy, with the first cohort awarded this MPharm degree graduating in 2020.  This programme is operated by the schools of pharmacy in three universities in Ireland (Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and Royal College of Surgeons Ireland).<\/p>  <p>  This newer pharmacy programme provides for both the academic and practical experience that is required by students to qualify to practise as a pharmacist in Ireland.  Students qualify after 5 years with a Masters in Pharmacy and are eligible to apply for registration as a pharmacist with the PSI.<\/p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Education and Training) (Integrated Course) Rules 2014 (S.I. No. 377 of 2014) is the legislation which underpins the new 5 year MPharm educational programme.  It includes the programme recognition and accreditation requirements, and details about the in-service training placements for students.<\/p>  <p>  Part of the PSI&rsquo;s accreditation process involves visits to the universities operating the MPharm programme, which includes meeting with representative students at each School of Pharmacy.  The accreditation teams assess the programme of training and education various standards, including one related to students and the supports available to students.<\/p>  <p>  The PSI has stated that it will continue to engage with the academic institutions that deliver the MPharm programme and their role is to ensure the quality of the MPharm programme and high standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200077#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":1106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200077#WRV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1107,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[2847\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200077#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of infants who have used clinical milk supplies from Northern Ireland and the UK over the past five years;

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose as usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient.  Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at:\u00a0hse.ie\/yourmedicines.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician.

However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and the HSE has advised that, currently, results of smear tests may take up to 22 weeks from the time of the test. Although many results are returned in less time, some may take longer.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog.

However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme\u00a0into stabilisation this year.\u00a0This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200078#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200078#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1166,"qnumday":456,"qnumall":"[3066\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200078#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional amount the national children&rsquo;s hospital will cost in 2019;

The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  <\/p><p>All medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.<\/p><p>The initial authorisation of Gardasil was supported by the results from the study known as Future II.  This study concluded that in young women who had not been previously infected with HPV-16 or HPV-18, those in the vaccine group had a significantly lower occurrence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia related to HPV-16 or HPV-18 than did those in the placebo group.<\/p><p>Subsequently the results from Future III updated the product information for Gardasil in relation to the vaccination of women up to 45 years old.<\/p><p>The trials for Future II or Future III were not conducted in Ireland and therefore the HPRA did not have access to the original clinical trial submissions, however, the results of the studies are publically available at <i>www.ema.europa.eu\/documents\/scientific-discussion\/gardasil-epar-scientific-discussion_en.pdf).<\/i><\/p><p>In both the Future II and Future III studies participants were randomised to either a vaccine group or placebo group.

The use of the aluminium-containing adjuvant in the placebo group is stated in the study documents referenced above. <\/p><p>A placebo arm is an important aspect of many clinical studies and supports the evaluation of the true overall effect of the experimental drug under study. There is a strong rationale for using a placebo in large pivotal studies as it is widely considered to be the most rigorous method of evaluating the efficacy of treatment or prevention interventions. The only difference in composition between the placebo and vaccine in the above-mentioned Gardasil trials was the absence of active substances (HPV virus type proteins) in the placebo.

The retention of a sufficient budget for the CAP is an essential requirement for Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been actively engaging with my European counterparts on this issue. Along with counterparts from France, Spain, Finland, Portugal and Greece, we have called for the restoration of the CAP budget for the 2021 &ndash; 2027 period to current levels.  Up to 20 Member States have joined this alliance and we will continue to work together in an effort to build consensus on this point.  I recognise that to achieve the best outcome, we need to seek common ground with like minded Member States.  Ireland will continue to seek to build alliances as the negotiations for the next CAP and its budgetary allocation progress and I will continue to fight for a strong CAP budget. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the CAP legislative proposals themselves, the new regulations for the CAP 2021-27 were launched on Friday 1 June 2018 by Commissioner Hogan.  The existing four CAP Regulations (1305\/2013, 1306\/2013, 1307\/2013 and 1308\/2013) are being replaced by three new Regulations.  The Direct Payments Regulation (1307\/2013) and the Rural Development Regulation (1305\/2013 are being consolidated in one Regulation which establishes rules on the CAP strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States. The European Commission's objective is to have the proposals adopted by the co-legislators in Spring 2019, prior to the European Parliament Elections in May.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. There will be some additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in Council Regulations. Risk management measures, and measures to support young farmers and new entrants will be mandatory, and there will be a significant emphasis on education and technology adoption. At least 5% of rural development funds will be ring fenced for the LEADER Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The current proposals require Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plan to the Commission for approval before the deadline of 1 January 2020.

We must also acknowledge the exposure of the sector to Brexit impacts.<\/p>  <p>  However, one of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  I hope that this positive engagement will continue.  I have utilised the Beef Round table to highlight the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency and to support the sector through examination of mechanisms to add value along the supply chain and increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including Beef Producer Organisations.  Officials from my Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders in relation to Beef Producer Organisations.<\/p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the beef sector, in the last Budget I secured &euro;20 million for a new Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agri-food sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  It is also envisaged that suckler farmers will be the primary beneficiaries of the &euro;23 million ANC increase in addition to the &euro;20 million available under the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot.<\/p>  <p>  Securing new market access and enhancing existing Irish beef access has been a particular priority for many of the trade missions in 2017 and 2018. The opening of the Chinese market for Irish beef last year was the culmination of significant work, over a number of years.  My Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain market access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish beef products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200080#WRY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200080#WRY03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1281,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[2812\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200080#WRY03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if technical agricultural officers working in his Department have the opportunity to work until they are 70 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1282,"content":"<p>The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Bill 2018, which was enacted on 26<sup>th <\/sup>of December 2018 increases the compulsory retirement age for civil servants, recruited prior to 1<sup>st<\/sup>April 2004, from age 65 to age 70.<\/p><p>Technical Agricultural Officers employed by my Department, who meet the above criteria, are included in this cohort of staff and now have the opportunity to remain in employment until age 70. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200080#WRY03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme Applications","counter":1283,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200080#WRY03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[2841\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200080#WRY03500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a payment under a scheme will issue to a farmer (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1278","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1285,"content":"<p>The person named applied for investments under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme of TAMS II and the application was approved on 4 July 2017.

During this period, Irish applicants submitted a total of 28 eligible CEF applications for transport projects. This includes projects also involving other Member States, for funding for multi-beneficiary actions, which I have further detailed below. Three transport-related CEF funding applications of relevance to Ireland were submitted as part of the 2018 CEF call for proposals. These applications are currently being evaluated and assessed by the European Commission, with a decision to be made in the first half of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  CEF funding\u00a0is allocated in the form of grants awarded to\u00a0successful applicants\u00a0following competitive calls for proposals, which are published on the website of the European Commission.\u00a0Each call has specific funding priorities and explicit criteria for activities that are eligible for funding under that individual call and calls vary from year to year. <\/p>  <p>  Irish beneficiaries have to date received\u00a0over &euro;90.1 million\u00a0for projects on Ireland's Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Network. This figure includes funding where Irish project promoters have successfully joined with project promoters across other EU Member States. These\u00a0would include successful applications for the deployment of Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) and road transport projects with other Member States, which includes studies on the harmonisation of interoperable intelligent transport systems (ITS) and cooperative Intelligent transport systems (C-ITS).

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. <\/p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.<\/p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the Port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities, and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets, and new technology.  The Port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the Port over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I have met individually with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, to discuss Brexit matters on three occasions since mid-2017. I most recently met the Secretary of State, at his request, in Dublin on 8 November last.  Our discussion fully respected the mandate of the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Secretary of State outlined key areas of concern for the UK in relation to transport. <\/p>  <p>  While I did not specifically raise the issue of ownership of Rosslare Europort with the Secretary of State, I set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, including in relation to ports, aviation, road transport, and cross-border rail services. I stressed the importance of finalising the Withdrawal Agreement, highlighted the importance of the UK landbridge for Ireland as a route to European markets, and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports.    <\/p>  <p>  I stressed that as regards the future EU-UK relationship, Ireland wants to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, across a range of areas including transport. At the same time, I re-iterated the importance of preserving the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and that the EU&rsquo;s regulatory autonomy is respected.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that Brexit will have implications for a number of key ports and airports, and Rosslare continues to work closely with my Department and a range of other relevant Government Departments and Offices in preparing for the additional border controls that will arise from Brexit.  In this context, my Department has met Rosslare Port management on a number of occasions over the past year, most recently last week, about the infrastructure requirements of the Port in connection with Brexit.  My Department has also been meeting ferry and shipping companies regarding their plans for dealing with the challenges of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200081#WRZ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200082#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1370,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[2308\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200082#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the breakdown of his Department&rsquo;s capital expenditure to the end of December 2018 under the heading of B.8 sustainable transport.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1371,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that end year\u00a0outturn figures for the Vote for 2018 are currently being finalised;\u00a0however, the provisional breakdown of expenditure under Subhead B8: Public &amp;amp; Sustainable Transport is as follows:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Amount<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Smarter Travel \/ Sustainable Urban Transport<\/td><td>&euro;19.3m*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Heavy Rail Safety \/ Development<\/td><td>&euro;173.1m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Transport Infrastructure<\/td><td>&euro;195.6m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cycling and Walking<\/td><td>&euro;18.1m*<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Subject to finalisation <\/p><p>The bulk of funding provided under the various programmes is allocated to the National Transport<\/p><p>Authority (NTA) which in turn allocates the monies toward specific projects and programmes; however, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is also allocated money directly by my Department under the heavy rail safety \/ development programme in line with the Infrastructure Manager Multi Annual Contract (IMMAC) which funds maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network.<\/p><p>The Deputy will no doubt welcome the increased allocations I have secured\u00a0in Budget 2019\u00a0which represent an increase of 18% in capital expenditure under B8 Public &amp;amp; Sustainable Transport as compared to last year's allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200082#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200082#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[2336\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200082#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the review by the Irish Maritime Development Office into the use of the UK landbridge by exporters and importers here.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1374,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my answer to PQ number 2337\/19, copied below.<\/p><p>The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) report was published in November 2018 and is available on the publications section of the IMDO website (<i>www.imdo.ie<\/i>).<\/p><p>The report estimates that the annual volume of Roll on\/Roll off (RoRo) traffic using the landbridge to transport goods to and from the continent is approximately 3 million tonnes, which equates to approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles.

This Corridor map outlines a link from Ireland to the UK, through the UK land bridge, and on to continental Europe.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the European Commission has proposed an Amendment to Regulation (EU) No. 1316\/2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which would realign the NSMED Core Network Corridor given that the UK will no longer form part of the Corridor or the TEN-T network. \u00a0This proposal seeks to ensure that the NSMED Corridor does not become fragmented as a result of Brexit, and will take effect only when the CEF Regulation no longer applies to the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to revise the current alignment of the NSMED Corridor with linkages between Ireland (Cork and Dublin) and the ports of Rotterdam, Zeebrugge and Antwerp.

The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) report, published in November 2018, estimates that the annual volume of Roll on\/Roll off (RoRo) traffic using the landbridge to transport goods to and from the continent is approximately 3 million tonnes, which equates to approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles. The total value of trade with the EU using the landbridge is estimated to be &euro;21 billion, and may well be higher. This is a significant proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade and a significant aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s international road haulage sector.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the study, the landbridge is a strategically important route to market for many Irish importers and exporters and certain sectors of the economy will be adversely affected by Brexit, mainly those that trade in time sensitive goods, e.g. Agri-food, seafood etc. The study recommends that Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to the UK landbridge is protected in the ongoing EU-UK negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing liaison between Ireland, the European Commission and other similar affected Member States on matters relating to the land bridge.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0I\u00a0have also assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the Landbridge. I recognise that the longer journey time on these direct routes may not offer a viable alternative and some trade will continue to use the Landbridge or, in the event of significant delays, may become unviable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider,\u00a0I have\u00a0advised Government that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019, and if demand for further capacity arises, the shipping sector can respond quickly.

The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November and relates to the\u00a02017\/2018 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision, in general, meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0report outlines a 4% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in\u00a0\u00a0Dublin - Fingal, i.e.,\u00a011,149 children enrolled in registered services with 450 vacant childcare places.

I meet\u00a0 some of these in structured meetings or as part of visits or conferences I engage with.<\/p>  <p>  Key pieces of policy work such as the preparation of our new 10 year strategy, First 5, or the Affordable Childcare Scheme, warrant additional focused engagement with the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme\u00a0 (ACS) was first informed by an Open Policy Debate in 2015 as part of the work of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future investment in Childcare. Various representatives of the sector made a valuable contribution to the debate and the IDG report reflects their input. During the development of the policy of the scheme there was a public consultation and more than 4,000 responses were received and analysed.\u00a0\u00a0The ACS project currently utilises\u00a0a number of smaller working groups of key stakeholders to inform ongoing development. For example, the ACS team has conducted focus groups, completed usability testing and chaired working groups directly with parents and sample\u00a0groups of childcare providers to test, review and refine the scheme in an iterative process to design a system\u00a0that\u00a0will be\u00a0user friendly for both parents and childcare providers. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore regarding the ACS, there will be several hundred training and information events for childcare providers and their staff announced shortly to prepare for the launch of the scheme later this year. In 2017, eight roadshow events took place\u00a0nationwide, attended by almost\u00a01,000 childcare\u00a0practitioners, to discuss plans at that stage, including the September 2017 measures and the introduction of Programme Support Payments.\u00a0 Feedback at the events influenced policy formulation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the development of First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, a number of early learning and care providers and provider representative organisations participated in opportunities for engagement, including at two Open Policy Debates that I participated in.\u00a0 At one of these events, I asked two providers, one private and one community, to address the group of approximately 100 stakeholders, sharing their personal and professional reflections on what they would like to see in the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The recently published School Age Childcare Regulations were informed by a working group which included sectoral representatives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As Minister I regularly speak at conferences where I also have the opportunity to be briefed on important concerns and developments.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the time my officials and I commit to engaging with the sector is both critical and valuable.\u00a0 I believe that good engagement via a collaborative approach will assist us to tackle the many challenges and opportunities facing the early learning and care sector in Ireland. We are committed to\u00a0 continuing to develop ways to most effectively engage with stakeholders.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200084#WRCC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":1529,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200084#WRCC05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1530,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[2665\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200084#WRCC05900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the accusation that her Department and Tusla are using an outdated methodology to calculate the adequacy or otherwise of provision of domestic violence refuge places and supports as reported in the media (details supplied).","asker":"1215","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1531,"content":"<p>I am aware of the media report referenced by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV).<\/p>  <p>  The Council of Europe's document on minimum standards for support services for victims of domestic violence, \"Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services\", continues to be in effect.\u00a0 This document provides a detailed breakdown of minimum and aspirational standards that apply to a wide range of services for victims, including the level of provision of shelter places.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised me that it references this document in relation to all standards that apply to a wide range of services, including the level of provision of refuge spaces.<\/p>  <p>  \"Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services\" references two standards: either one shelter space per 10,000 head of adult population, or one shelter space per 10,000 head of female population, with specific measures of population and calculation of shelter spaces.

The abridged adoption certificate, which appears identical to a birth certificate by displaying details of adopters as &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot;, will be updated by way of regulation to also include details of &quot;parent&quot;, to coincide with commencement of legislation that will provide for this on birth certificates.<\/p><p>Legal recognition of adoptions is provided for in the Adoption Act 2010 (as amended).

The primary purpose of the Act is to give effect to Article 42A (Children) of the Constitution, in so far as it relates to adoption. In particular, the Act provides for:<\/p><p>- The adoption of any child, regardless of the marital status of his\/her parents.<\/p><p>- The Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Court, to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.<\/p><p>- The Authority or the Court to ascertain the child&rsquo;s views and such views to be given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>- The introduction of revised criteria for dispensing with consent, in the case of the adoption of children whose parents fails in their duty towards them.<\/p><p>- The adoption of a child by his or her step parent without the requirement for the child's other parent to adopt his or her own child.<\/p><p>- The provision for the joint adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples.<\/p><p>- The further adoption of a child who was previously adopted.<\/p><p>The Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 amends the Adoption Act 2010. Before the commencement of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 only a sole applicant or a married couple could apply to adopt a child under the Adoption Act 2010. On commencement of the Marriage Act 2015, a same sex married couple who were married in accordance with that Act automatically became eligible to apply to adopt a child.<\/p><p>Therefore, there are\u00a0no plans to include provisions in civil registration legislation, including the proposed Civil Registration Bill 2019,\u00a0that would extend additional\u00a0provision in respect of such adoptions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200087#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1667,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200087#WRFF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1668,"qnumday":633,"qnumall":"[2602\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200087#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position in relation to the proposed changes of the pension system in 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1669,"content":"<p>A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA to be introduced from 2020 on the 28th of May to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were\u00a0invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised, and I understand will be submitted to me very shortly.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the pension is still intended to be a contributory pension, as exists in most developed countries,\u00a0and that those who have contributed to the Social Insurance Fund would still\u00a0build up\u00a0pension rights through\u00a0PRSI paid over the\u00a0years.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will be introduced by legislation,\u00a0and the\u00a0proposals\u00a0will, I believe, be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of this, on 23 January\u00a0 2018, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated using an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of\u00a0new HomeCaring periods.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  Following enactment of the necessary legislation at the end of 2018, reviews of c. 80,000 pensioners impacted has commenced, and given the numbers involved\u00a0will take a number of months to complete.  As the reviews are processed, the pensioners involved will be notified of the outcome of their review, or asked to provide further information to allow the review to be concluded.

A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were\u00a0invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised, and I understand will be submitted to me very shortly.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the pension is still intended to be a contributory pension, as exists in most developed countries,\u00a0and that those who have contributed to the Social Insurance Fund would still\u00a0build up\u00a0pension rights through\u00a0PRSI paid over the\u00a0years.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of this, on 23 January last, the Government\u00a0agreed to\u00a0allow pensioners, born on or after the 1st September 1946, affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands, to have their state pension (contributory)\u00a0entitlement calculated under\u00a0an interim\u00a0TCA (TCA2012).  This also\u00a0provides for\u00a0up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or\u00a0looking after individuals who needed increased levels of care.<\/p>  <p>  In late September, my Department commenced the examination and categorisation of around 79,000 individual social insurance records of pensioners identified for review.  Information letters have issued to these 79,000 pensioners to let them know that their social insurance record is being examined and what will now happen.  This number for review will increase weekly, as new non-maximum rate state pension (contributory) claims are awarded, and each of these pensioners will be communicated with by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation to facilitate this interim TCA and the application of HomeCaring Periods was enacted at the end of 2018.  This allows the Department to progress the reviews and that work has now begun.  The Department has recruited over 110 temporary staff members to expedite this work.  As the reviews are processed, the pensioners involved will be notified of the outcome of their review, or asked to provide further information to allow the review to be concluded.  Where the review results in a rate increase, their weekly payment will be adjusted and arrears paid - backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner's 66th birthday if later.  Where an increase is not awarded, their personal rate of pension will remain unchanged.

Many of the provisions contained within the Directive will\u00a0support positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector.  The Directive provides for a range of new requirements concerning governance, management standards in schemes, safekeeping of assets, the need for clear and relevant information to members, the removal of obstacles to cross-border provision of pension services and the facilitation of cross border transfer of schemes.  There are also provisions that will enhance the powers of the\u00a0Pensions Authority\u00a0for\u00a0effective supervision of occupational pensions.<\/p>  <p>  The IORPS Directive was the result of almost three years of discussion and negotiation and came into force on 12 January 2017.  Officials in\u00a0my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process of the IORP II Directive.  This is a substantial Directive and preparation of regulations to transpose the Directive are at an advanced stage.  It\u00a0is expected that transposition\u00a0into Irish law will be achieved\u00a0later this quarter.  This timeframe is in keeping with many other EU countries. It should be noted that from enquiries made, the Department is aware of only one country which has transposed the Directive to date.<\/p>  <p>  Codes of practice will also be issued by the Pensions Authority following approval of the Minister.  The codes will expand on requirements, policies and principles prescribed in the transposing regulations. They will explain in practical detail what the Authority will expect from trustees to demonstrate their commitment to serving the best interests of members, deferred members and other beneficiaries.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that schemes are informed of their obligations under the Directive, the Pensions Authority will also undertake a communication campaign on the implementation of the Directive.  The Authority will engage and consult with industry stakeholders and trustees on implementation of the new regulatory regime and related codes of practice.

review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. <\/p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced later in Q1 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid 2019.<\/p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning Acts, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Therefore, it is not intended to place a moratorium on applications for planning permission for wind farm developments as referred to pending the finalisation of the revisions to the 2006 Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200089#WRHH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":1767,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200089#WRHH00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1768,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[2624\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012200089#WRHH00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the right of United Kingdom citizens resident here to vote in European Parliament elections will be maintained in the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March) Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1769,"content":"<p>It is intended to bring legislative proposals to Government shortly to amend the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 (as amended) in order to give effect to the recommendations in the Report on European Parliament Constituencies 2018 in connection with the configuration of our European Parliament constituencies and the number of members to be elected from each such constituency.

The scheme was included by Kildare County Council in their 2017 bids under Measure 1 of the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2016-2018.  This measure provides for improvements to group water schemes in order to achieve compliance with the quality parameters of the Drinking Water Regulations.  In 2017 my Department's funding allocations under the programme included an allocation of &euro;89,490 for works to the scheme.  While no specific allocation was made in 2018 the scheme was eligible to receive funding from a retained reserve to support projects not included in the allocations.  In doing this my Department undertook to work with the Council with a view to there being a plan in place to ensure the satisfactory progression of works.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that in 2018 Kildare County Council completed an options report on the scheme. This report was compiled by the Council to provide clarity on the best way forward for investment in the scheme.  A whole life cost (capital and operation) was used to make this assessment.    <\/p>  <p>  I understand the report showed that the best solution, from an economic and compliance point of view is for the scheme to interconnect to, and be taken in charge by, Irish Water.  The Irish Water supply would ensure that householders in the supply area for the scheme receive drinking water that is in compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations on a consistent long-term basis.  The least favourable option identified was to continue as a private group water scheme.  Under this option, the associated costs are considerably higher than for the other options and even with significant capital investment the scheme would still be considered vulnerable to non-compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations.  The water supplied by the scheme has a record of containing high levels of nitrates.   <\/p>  <p>  In October 2018 the Council wrote to the management of the scheme outlining the funding position and enclosing a copy of the options report.  The letter advised that funding was available to upgrade the scheme to the standard required by Irish Water in order to take the scheme in charge.  I am advised that officials from Kildare County Council met with the scheme on 10 January 2019.   <\/p>  <p>  Funding is not an impediment to a solution that is sustainable and cost effective in the long-term.

The landlord must also provide three examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area to demonstrate this.
