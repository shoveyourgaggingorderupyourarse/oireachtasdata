Covid-19 has presented Ireland and countries around the world with our biggest public health challenge in living memory.  In recent months, more transmissible variants have driven up infections, and governments right across Europe are extending restrictions.  As we are all aware, daily numbers of new cases in Ireland remain stubbornly high.  Last Sunday, 769 new cases were reported in the country.<\/p>  <p>  It must feel to many like this pandemic will never end.  Many people are understandably frustrated at what can seem like a largely unchanging landscape.  Pandemics end, however, and this pandemic will end too.  Its end is firmly in sight thanks to the remarkable triumph of science and medicine, which have produced hugely effective vaccines very quickly.<\/p>  <p>  Our biggest weapon against Covid-19 is our vaccination programme.  More than 700,000 vaccines have now been administered.  People right across Ireland, from Achill Island to Mizen Head, from Tory Island to Cape Clear Island, have been vaccinated.  Many more will be vaccinated today.<\/p>  <p>  The stories from GP clinics around the country have been uplifting.  Dr. Mait &Oacute; Faol&aacute;in described how the GP-led vaccination clinic at The Helix in Dublin vaccinated more people in one day than there were Covid-19 cases nationally over the previous week.  I heard another GP describe the sense of collective mission and history being made.  I believe he spoke for many when he expressed the deep satisfaction felt by so many directly involved at finally taking the fight to Covid-19 after what he described as a year of defensive skirmishes.  That GP, Dr. Stephen Murphy, described what we are now witnessing as a kind of D-Day for GPs.  These personal stories are filled with hope.  There will be more of these stories in the coming weeks and months as our supply of vaccines increases.<\/p>  <p>  We are using three highly effective vaccines and expect to have received in excess of 1 million doses by the end of March in just six days&rsquo; time.  Next month, we are due to begin to receive deliveries of a fourth vaccine, made by Janssen.  More than one in eight adults has now received a vaccine in Ireland.  We now have clear and strong evidence that the vaccines are having a big effect in keeping people safe from the effects of Covid-19.  This is hugely encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  Our nursing homes were among the most vulnerable settings for this virus.  Nursing home residents and staff were the first to be vaccinated in Ireland.  Serial testing for Covid-19 in nursing homes is now showing a positivity rate of less than 0.2%.  In late January, 11% of Covid-19 cases were detected in nursing home outbreaks.  By mid-March, that had fallen from 11% to less than 1%.  That is a big drop and it is bringing comfort and relief to nursing home residents, their families and, of course, everyone working throughout the country in the nursing home and long-term residential care sectors.  Now, in-person visits to nursing homes are restarting.  Many families will be wondering when they can hug a loved one in a nursing home or hold their loves one&rsquo;s hand without worrying about putting them at risk.  By reducing transmission in the community and ensuring widespread vaccination, that will become a reality again.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress is also being made vaccinating older people.  We are moving through the age cohorts.  The first group was those aged 85 and older.  We then moved on to those aged 80 to 84 and have now started vaccinating those aged 75 and older.  Here again, the results are really positive.  The number of cases of Covid-19 among those aged 85 and older has fallen by nearly a half over the past two weeks alone.  Our Covid-19 vaccination programme is also having a spectacular impact on hospitalisations of older people.  In January, 11% of people hospitalised with Covid-19 were residents in long-term residential care.  That has now fallen from 11% to just half of 1%.  Given this really encouraging data, it is no surprise that public support for vaccines in Ireland is very high.<\/p>  <p>  In April, we are due to receive approximately a million vaccine doses.  That will be approximately the same amount received up to the end of this month.  In May, and then again in June, we are also due to receive around a million vaccines a month.  As always, this is dependent on the pharmaceutical companies delivering to the agreed amounts.  If they do, then four in every five adults can be offered either one or two vaccine doses by the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  I want to finish by addressing the current situation with Covid-19 cases, something we are all watching very closely.  It must be said that huge progress has been made since January.  Ireland now has one of the lowest rates of Covid-19 cases in Europe.  As we all know, cases are still high and have been rising in recent days.  We are seeing a big fall in cases associated with the vaccinated cohorts.  That big fall, unfortunately, is being offset by an increase in cases associated with increased mobility and increased interactions.  I thank colleagues right across the D&aacute;il for their ongoing efforts in engaging with people in their communities and nationally by encouraging them to stick with the public health measures.<\/p>  <p>  While vaccines will facilitate our exit from these tough public health measures as more of the population is vaccinated, we are now also making other interventions.  Enhanced measures are being introduced today at specific locations to help monitor and suppress the spread of Covid-19 in areas that are showing case levels which are persistently high.  Measures include deployment of HSE mobile units with walk-in testing, that is, self-referral for testing, Community Call supports, and engagement with local communities by our public health teams.  We are using antigen or rapid testing in the healthcare and meat processing sectors, and pilot projects will soon be launched to examine opportunities for rapid testing in other sectors as well.<\/p>  <p>  We are introducing mandatory hotel quarantine for people travelling from what are regarded as high-risk zones.  We are the first country in the European Union to introduce such a comprehensive system, and it builds on extensive measures already in place.<\/p> <p>These include fines and-or prosecution for non-essential travel, pre-flight PCR test requirements, mandatory home quarantine and genome sequencing of positive tests from category two countries.  Work is ongoing around a new campaign, delivered in co-operation with employers and trade unions, on compliance with the work safely protocol.<\/p> <p> This will be the largest vaccination programme in the history of the State.  Huge progress has been made in a short time.  The vaccination programme is less than three months in operation and we are vaccinating people as quickly as possible.  I thank all of those involved for their hard work which has brought us to this point which will, in time, result in the full resumption of our normal lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500003#A00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616667000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The national vaccination programme is unprecedented in its scale and will grow to become the largest immunisation programme in the history of the State.  It is less than three months since the first vaccination dose was administrated in Ireland.  Already more than 680,000 people have received a first dose with more than 184,000 of our most vulnerable and at-risk, including some of those with a disability, now fully vaccinated against the disease receiving both a first and a second dose.  Ireland continues to perform above the EU average with almost 5% of the adult population now being fully vaccinated.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccination programme continues to progress and has reached the community as we continue to vaccinate our older citizens.  The benefits of the vaccination programme are being experienced as Covid infection rates continue to fall among the groups targeted for vaccination.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of disability services, this is all being done while the provision of services continues.  I must stress how grateful we all are to the staff working on the front line, continuing to deliver services for people with disabilities and their families, day in, day out.  There have been a total of 317 outbreaks of two or more cases in disability services since the onset of the pandemic, 149 of which occurred this year.  This has been a significant challenge for service users and staff.  Services have done their utmost to keep people safe.  I am pleased to report that two thirds of the disability outbreaks in 2021 have now been declared as closed as of 20 March.  However, 53 such outbreaks still remain open.<\/p>  <p>  Tragically, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has advised that we have lost 35 service users to Covid in these outbreaks.  To lose a loved one is always painful.  To lose one during the pandemic, where nobody can shake a hand or give a hug, compounds it.  To those families who have lost loved ones, I pass on my sincere condolences.<\/p>  <p>  The most frequently asked questions I get about the roll-out of the vaccination are for people with disabilities and their carers.  As the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will confirm, we have had a number of conversations in recent months about this.  I have also had discussions with several officials in the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure we can provide clarity around when people with disabilities will be vaccinated.  From the very beginning, the vaccination programme has been built on fairness.  The focus has been on ensuring those who face the greatest risk of severe disease and death, the oldest and most vulnerable in society, as well as those who care for them, were prioritised for vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, the vaccination allocation strategy was revised to take into account the latest clinical and medical advice based on national and international evidence.  Those with a medical condition that puts them into a very high risk of severe disease and death are now being vaccinated in group four.  I am delighted the HSE recently began vaccinating this vulnerable group.  This provides people with disabilities further reassurance of where they align in the vaccination allocation strategy.  It is good to see that 1,200 people with a disability living in residential care, aged over 65, have been fully vaccinated, while an additional 4,000 people in disability services were vaccinated up to the week of 13 March.  It is important to note too that disability services staff who are front-line healthcare workers are scheduled for vaccination as part of the prioritised healthcare worker cohort.<\/p>  <p>  Next Monday, the vaccination programme will be three months old.  Truly remarkable progress has been made in such a short space of time.  There is no doubt that there will continue to be challenges but the programme has already demonstrated its agility in responding to unpredictable changes in delivery schedules and changes to clinical evidence.  The programme sets out from the start to protect our most vulnerable, along with the front-line healthcare workers who place themselves at great personal risk to care for them.  The vaccines are proving to be more than effective and more than we could have hoped for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500004#B00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1616667000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We are entering into a critical phase in the fight against Covid.  This is the phase in which we can fight back and win.  It is the phase in which we can give people hope that, over the next number of months if we start to get things right, we can see the easing of restrictions as we move into the third quarter.<\/p>  <p>  For that to happen, however, the State has to get its part right.  The contract we made with people was that they would abide by tough restrictions.  They have been doing so for some time.  The State then would step up its responsibilities and make sure it would get right what is under its control.  In areas such as test and trace, travel and quarantine, as well as the vaccine roll-out, we fell short in the first quarter, however.  To have any chance of winning the battle against Covid - the Minister said the same in his opening statement - in the next quarter we have to get all of those basics right.<\/p>  <p>   What is the number of vaccines which will have been received by the State and administered by the end of March?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500004#B00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1616667000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Deputy's comments on this being the start of a period of hope.

The testing and tracing programme is very comprehensive.  We have one of the highest capacities and compare very favourably.  Our international border measures are now the most comprehensive in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  As with any vaccine programme in the world, of course there have been things that we need to learn and do better.  The vaccine programme I think has gone well.  In terms of the numbers, we are expecting significant deliveries in the next five days or so.  We do not really want to get caught up in whether it is the last week of March or the first week of April.  The contracted deliveries are for the end of March.  We would expect to receive in excess of 1.1 million doses.<\/p>  <p>  The target then obviously is to administer those doses as they come in.

I have two questions about that remit.  The Minister spoke earlier about testing and tracing and said we can agree to disagree.  I have never believed we got it fully right because testing and tracing has to be used to hunt down the virus and stay ahead of it.  Many public health experts have written in our national newspapers and pointed out the same issue I have raised time and again.  We simply do not have the capacity.  We need thousands of contact tracers if we want to do the deep retrospective contact tracing that needs to be done.  Last November the Minister and his Government committed to deep retrospective tracing to get to the source of infections and outbreaks, looking back over nine days and not 48 hours.  Has that happened?  Is it going to happen?  How robustly is that going to happen?  As we sit here today, how many contact tracers are employed in the HSE?  How many of them are doing the type of deep retrospective contact tracing that is necessary?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the vaccine roll-out, will the Minister give us an assurance on it today?  Of course it is good news that 1 million doses are coming in the second quarter, but as the administration of vaccines ratchets up, people will want to know the Minister can get the roll-out and the administration side right.  Do we have the staff to make that happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500005#C00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1616667600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>To clarify, we will receive 1 million doses per month.

We are expecting a very high volume of vaccines to come in in the next number of days.  We are not looking at an incremental increase in April; we are looking at a step-change in the number of people being vaccinated.  As recently as yesterday I met with HSE management and we again went through this.

I felt like writing back to him because anyone who wants to understand the inequalities in Irish healthcare would feel the lack of a proper system such as a national health service has been highlighted in the vaccine roll-out.  I understand that pandemics highlight inequality.  People who are housebound due to ill health have been contacting my office in Tralee as they have not received a vaccine.  Their daughters have been contacting us and their GPs.  The GPs told them to go to the HSE, and the HSE said to go to the National Ambulance Service.  That roll-out has not worked out well for them.<\/p>  <p>  If people are aligned to a large GP practice, they are top of the queue, but if they live in a rural area or are attached to a small practice, it has been suggested they buddy up with another practice.  That is okay for organising a school tour to Fota Island but it is not good enough for getting a vaccine rolled out in a fair way.  GPs feel the system was not managed.  There was no system for pairing or buddying up, there was no guidance and there was nobody available to listen to them when they needed it most.  Desperate patients contacting us is not good enough.  The supply chain has not worked well enough.  There is too much confusion, and when there were problems in the supply chain, the flaws in the Government's roll-out were exposed badly.  What has the Government learned from the initial stage of the roll-out?  What steps have been taken to ensure a smoother roll-out?  What steps are being taken to ensure there is communication with patients and members of the public when they go to access the vaccine into the future?<\/p>  <p>  The vision of reopening has to be apparent to people.

My concern is that the positivity that the Minister expresses as to where we are now and where we are going and the caveats therein cause significant confusion with the public because they are deeply concerned through the stories that they are hearing from their GPs, on the radio or in print media, that the vaccine is slow in its arrival.  The Minister cannot ignore that.  At a time when we were talking about vaccines and were asking America for the loan of vaccines because they had a stockpile, we were being told that that was not the case.  <i>The New York Times<\/i>carried a banner headline on an article about the AstraZeneca vaccine that was stockpiled in the US.  The Minister cannot deploy spin to beat the facts and the fact is that AstraZeneca has failed us, Europe has failed us to a degree, and we are not getting sufficient vaccine.<\/p><p>The Devil is in the detail.  When we talk about the categories that are being vaccinated, we have to continue to remember that there should be a political input into this.  I reject the statement made yesterday that if carers in the home get vaccinated they are taking it from somebody else.  That is simply not true.  We are asking that they be recognised properly and that they be given a place within the different categories which respects the work that they do and their position.  That can be said also of the Garda, vulnerable teachers and so on, and we need to address it and to show political leadership by responding in a way to the change that is needed in the different sectors when a case is made.  That is not asking for anyone to jump the queue.  <\/p><p>In the same way we hear the argument about going back to places of worship.  The fact of the matter is that ten people attending a funeral in a massive church is absolutely ridiculous and there is no common sense attached to the argument that there should only be ten people.  These are the issues that people are watching, understanding and questioning.  They want to know why there can only be ten people in a church but that there can be as many people in a store as one likes.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to look at the carers and at the places of worship and to give consideration-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500006#D00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1616668200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is up.

I will give three examples.  First, there is a single mother in my area with an immunocompromised child.  The mother herself is young and fit but she cannot afford to become ill as she is the child's only carer.  She does not know when she will be vaccinated.  There is a couple caring for their young daughter with leukaemia.  Their support system is gone because of Covid and they are now terrified of catching Covid and passing it on to their daughter.  Of course, they too are young and healthy, so they are at the end of the queue in that sense.  As carers, they will be prioritised but they do not know where, how and when.

I cannot get a response from my CHO, and the HSE helpline refers me back to the vaccine roll-out plan.  Any parliamentary question with the word &ldquo;vaccine&rdquo; in it seems to get a fairly generic response linking me back to the HSE website, so there is no point in me reading it out.

It is very welcome news.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have served our communities with the utmost distinction during the pandemic.  Their unwavering commitment to public service deserves our thanks and we recognise their work involves duties that entail a high level of risk.  I feel there is a genuine need to prioritise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the vaccine allocation strategy.  I also wish to include the Defence Forces, who have done tremendous work in contact tracing and logistics, and will also play their part in the mandatory quarantine programme.  I also want to highlight teachers, who have facilitated the reopening of our education sector.  Their work involves a high level of interaction with students and they also should be prioritised in the vaccine strategy.  I also make special reference to special education teachers and special needs assistants.  We need them to be protected to ensure the education sector is protected.<\/p>  <p>  One final area I want to highlight is that of maternity services.  We have seen there is a serious need to reconsider and, in particular, increase the time allocated for birth partners and fathers to spend together with mothers after labour.  We must end the current situation where fathers are not permitted to enter for scans, leaving pregnant women potentially receiving tragic news alone.  This is an important step forward as we see many front-line workers and health staff have now been vaccinated.

Does he believe that, because of this, it is now possible to look at a more nuanced strategy for reopening, where we could look at it on a county or regional basis?

There is a really interesting discussion that we are beginning to have around vaccine certificates or, as the Deputy said, not necessarily just that but it could also be negative PCR tests.  We have seen very interesting pilots in Israel, for example, with open-air concerts available to people who can authenticate that they have been vaccinated.  I know the Deputy will be well aware the EU is looking at so-called green certs, although, interestingly, the WHO, as of now, is not in favour of that because of the question around transmissibility versus protection.  However, it is a very interesting question that we need to look further into.<\/p>  <p>  To give a short answer on whether the risk profile is changing in terms of the link between the number of cases and the number of hospitalisations and fatalities, absolutely, it is.  It is exactly what the national vaccination programme is doing.  It is by vaccinating those most vulnerable that, essentially, for the same number of cases, what we will be expecting to see is significantly less illness, harm and death from that.

They have been to their excellent GP practice, which tells them it too is in the dark, and does not know when they will get the vaccine.  Also in north Kildare, there are people with complex illnesses, like advanced emphysema, being sent to their GP by their consultant, who tells them to go back to their consultant.  None of them seems to know when they are going to be vaccinated.  I had a similar call last night from a cancer patient in Celbridge who has been sent from the hospital to the GP, and the GP has told them to go back to the hospital.<\/p> <p>Nobody is able to tell them when they are going to get the vaccine.  I submitted a parliamentary question asking when people over 70 with chronic illnesses would be vaccinated and when their GPs would be informed of the plan and I got a one-line answer.

I had to send that one-line response to several of my constituents last night, apologising to them and assuring them that I would be raising the matter with the Minister in the D&aacute;il today.

When it becomes clear that there will be doses left over, people who are next on the list should be on site to get the jab so that there will be none of this nonsense about vaccine doses going down the drain.  We overbook planes and I do not see why we cannot overbook vaccinations.  Everybody knows that the vaccinators are working to their limit and doing their best and people would not be upset if they had to come back the next day.  After those who are next on the list, would the Minister consider spare vaccines for local carers, particularly parents of children with profound disabilities?  These people are worn out.  They have not been using day care centres because they are so worried about their children.  They are terrified of getting Covid, even though they are fit and well, as they do not know who will look after their children if they die.

However, I hear the same targets around the 14-day incidence rate, the R number and so on.  I do not see any change in the thresholds.   We need to have a more honest discussion about that and if we recognise that there are lower risks, when will we be able to have conversations with different sectors about how they can make small changes to make their sectors safer?

In fact, I am in the middle of a very detailed conversation with the modelling group, led by Professor Nolan, on exactly this issue.  We know, for example, that 88% of Covid fatalities in Ireland to date have been among those aged 70 and over, rising to 93% for those aged 65 and over.  There are different rates in terms of hospitalisation and serious illness but it is essential that changes to the risk profile because of the incredible impact of the vaccination are factored in.  In other words, Ireland will be able to deal with a higher level of cases in a much safer way when we have vaccinated and highly protected the most vulnerable groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500009#G00800","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1616670600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>We have had a slow roll out of vaccines.

These tests are cheap and can be another tool to combat this pandemic.  Perhaps the Minister will come back to me on that.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to information gathering, there is no database for vaccinations.

I believe there is a role for rapid testing but there are differently held views among experts on both sides of this.  Some believe there is a very limited role for rapid testing, while others believe there is a very broad and useful role for it.  I am in favour of rapid testing.  There are risks, such as people believing they have a highly accurate negative test, but with rapid testing they do not.  Serious concerns have also been expressed about how those people may then behave in social interactions.  They would incorrectly believe that they have a negative result in the same way one would have from PCR testing.  On the other side, however, rapid testing is very quick, it is easy and it is cost effective.  If the right test is used in the right way, and when a person gets a positive result from it, the result can be very accurate, which is up to 99.9% accurate.  I believe that rapid testing has a greater role to play.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies have asked what we are doing in this regard.  I have established an expert group, led by Professor Mark Ferguson, to report back to me on that.  The group has come up with some very interesting and thought provoking views.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, and I have a large project happening in the meat processing plants.  Rapid testing has been deployed into healthcare settings.  We are looking at pilot programmes where other sectors and areas could use rapid testing, be they in the construction sector or other commercial and State sectors.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of the heart transplant patients, I will ask NIAC for a view and the public health team for a detailed answer to that for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I thank both Deputies for their supportive words on the helpline and the enhanced local measures.  As of 11 a.m. today, five new centres for walk-in testing have opened up.  Four are in Dublin and one is in Offaly.  I must clarify that this is not for rapid testing, it is for PCR testing and it is self-referral.  We are starting with five areas for seven days and we can increase that if there is a strong demand for it.  We are targeting areas with persistently high cases to try to encourage people in the local communities to get tested so we can really identify and get rid of this virus, especially in the areas where case numbers are very high.<\/p>  <p>  I will absolutely take up the Deputy's point about the Carlow vaccination centre with the HSE.  I am aware that more vaccination centres are now coming on line.  Many of them have been tested and trialled with healthcare workers and others.

With every passing day, patience and tolerance are fading.  There have been problems, excuse after excuse and fingers pointing in all directions.  As people hear about confusion and distrust, they become more swamped by despair.  Their frustration grows.  The public are very conscious that mass vaccination is the only route to personal freedom.

Much of the time it is because of infection prevention and control in the hospitals.  I fully share the Deputy's passion and desire to get these services back.  We have taken a few actions.  In this year's budget, for the first time I have fully funded the national cancer strategy.  The doctors, clinicians and oncologists I am talking to are very enthusiastic about what can be done in progressing cancer treatment in the country this year.  The Deputy can rest assured that we will continue to do that in subsequent years.  In addition, one of the areas the oncologists are very interested in is the allocation we have made this year of &euro;50 million for new drugs.  It is believed that approximately one third of that will be for oncology drugs so there is a lot going on.

As of 11 o'clock this morning, any teacher, pupil or parent in our area who has a concern and needs to access a test can do so.  That is a very welcome step for education, if not for the wider monitoring of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I hope the five centres are the start of dealing with this virus.  In my constituency, Whitehall-Artane, Ballymun and Finglas have some of the highest rates of infection in the country.  The Minister might consider them for the location of an additional test centre when they become available.  The two test centres we have are within a 5 km or 6 km distance but I imagine the Minister wants to catch as many cases as possible so I urge him to consider those areas with the highest numbers.<\/p>  <p>  Third, April has been indicated as the month when the supply of vaccines will finally arrive.  In terms of AstraZeneca particularly, can the Minister give the indicative dates and timelines the pharmaceutical companies have given him for delivery in April?<\/p>  <p>  My final question concerns the continued desire to clarify the position of key workers.

The Minister and I both agree that we simply cannot disappoint these people.  NPHET and the Government have significant decisions to make over the coming days but the reality is that the public needs to see the start of a pathway out of lockdown.  At the end of the month, we will be 13 weeks into the current lockdown, and businesses need to know a start date, whether that is May, June or July.  They certainly need some sort of signposting.  We need to allow children back to play and practise sport or hobbies.  They have lost out on the guts of a crucial year of their development and it is time to restart for them, especially as the evenings are getting longer.<\/p>  <p>  As we approach the most important date in the Christian calendar, it is important that people of faith will be able to celebrate Easter in churches this year.

It is time for golf and other individual sports, such as fishing, to resume in a controlled environment, because all of these can be done in a controlled manner and people have proven sensible in the past.  The retail and hospitality sectors need to see a roadmap.  They need at least indicative start dates that they can work towards.  They have lost staff, customers and suppliers.  They will need to rebuild and cannot be restarted overnight.

As we look ahead to these three months and the implementation of the vaccination programme in earnest, it is also critical that next week sees the delivery of a message to the public that states that we are in this together and on a journey together.

It is to support people, communities and geographic areas where people need this support so that we can find this virus, treat people, isolate the virus and get the case numbers back down.

They also need a voice and to be respected.<\/p>  <p>  Besides the issues with supplies, Ireland's vaccination roll-out rumbles on at a snail's pace.  Clinics and doctors all over west Cork have been trying to get vaccines for their patients.  The Clonakilty medical centre was supposed to receive 210 vaccines last week.  It received 85.  These were supposed to be administered to people who are between 79 and 85 years old.  Imagine the disappointment of these patients in Clonakilty and the surrounding areas at being told that they are getting the vaccine one minute, and then in the next minute that there is not enough supply.  I was speaking to a doctor in Bantry, where only 40% of the promised vaccines are being received.  This doctor said that if they received the correct number of vaccines, doctors and staff would work day and night to administer it.  The doctor said that there are patients who desperately need it so that they can get back to some type of a life that they had before this hit.  One patient went to that doctor last week.  This lady had not left her home in more than a year.  Take a minute to think about that and imagine not leaving one's home for a whole year.  This roll-out is not good enough.  This Government has to fulfil its promises to people in this country, vaccinate people who want to be vaccinated, get the country back up and running and stop playing with people's lives.<\/p>  <p>  Why has the Government not applied for the EU emergency support funding?  The garda&iacute; have been at the front line in the pandemic but are at the back of the line to receive the vaccination.  They have been in contact with me and have asked when they will be offered the vaccination.  Student doctors in Cork University Hospital, Bon Secours and Bantry General Hospital are being told that their contracts will not be renewed, which means that we will lose many of these talented doctors.  We are letting down our guard.  The pandemic is nowhere near over.  I ask the Minister to rescind this decision and renew these contracts.  Hospitals such as Bantry General Hospital need these doctors.  I would appreciate a written reply about that issue.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister really believe that lockdowns are working?  People are dying all over the country and are in pain because they cannot access medical treatment or mental health services.  Teenagers are being kept at home from school.

County Laois is doing exceptionally well with a low incidence rate of Covid, while in County Offaly, there are reports of concern.  We need to see the localised figures.  It is not good enough just to give us figures for the county.  We need to put it into context.  We have had 331 cases in Offaly over 14 days, but that is out of 77,000 people.  These figures being churned out create much fear and alarm.  We need to give people the facts and the context.  I am concerned and I know people are doing their best.  Businesses are at breaking point where they have done their best to put every measure that they could in place to ensure the safety of all.  The roll-out of the vaccine has been less than satisfactory.  I have received a substantial volume of calls from people in Offaly who are concerned.<\/p> <p>I am wondering if that is also a factor.  Without pointing the finger at communities, perhaps the vaccine roll-out should be looked at, and how County Offaly is faring in comparison to other areas.

I call on the Minister and the Government to resume cancer services and do all they can for cancer patients and their families, who are going through a dreadful time.

Once again, I want to put this issue in perspective.  Some 52% of Covid deaths, amounting to 4,628 of the total, have been registered since 1 January 2021.  Of the 232,164 confirmed cases, 60% have been notified since 1 January 2021.  More people have died and more cases have been confirmed in this phase of the pandemic, all of which were eminently foreseeable.  I will not use up my time on this point because I raised it last week, but it is important to put it into perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has given a statement, and I welcome him and believe he is taking the right approach by standing here and doing his best to answer questions.  However, I am certainly not happy with those answers.  The whole debate is phrased in terms of the vaccine roll-out, which I understand is the title of the topic at hand, but generally, vaccination is one part of an effective overall plan for dealing with Covid.  I notice that the talk on the part of the Government is about vaccination now, not just today because that is the topic at hand, but generally.  All our eggs are in one basket, which is totally unacceptable.  <\/p>  <p>  I will make a few general points in a moment.  However, first I want to take issue with one or two points the Minister made in his statement.  When he wants to quote GPs, there is an onus on him to get a broad variety of GPs for this purpose.  I welcome the opinion of GPs who think the vaccine roll-out is a collective mission and that history is being made, it is D-Day and it is all marvellous.  However, like many Deputies today, I can quote other GPs, in my case from Connemara.  I have been told, for example, that the roll-out is totally inconsistent in Connemara.  It is most unusual for doctors to contact me, so they are going out on a limb when they do so.  One doctor told me: \"Despite the Minister's assurances and his undoubted confidence in the information he is receiving, the fact remains that there are huge gaps in the amount of vaccines being rolled out.\"  I know of GP practices with 500 patients aged over 70 that are only getting a small number of vaccines and other practices with fewer patients in that age group that are receiving more.  I know of a case in the middle of February, where three out of four GP practices in an area three received a supply of vaccines and one got nothing.  The GP in question spoke on the radio and was very vocal about the issue and has got any number of Pfizer vaccines since.  He said this himself.  He has now moved on to administering the vaccine to over 70 year olds.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge inconsistencies, therefore, on the ground.  I am not sure that we could expect any better, because the HSE was creaking before the pandemic and the public health system was in a mess.  I want a debate some day in the D&aacute;il on all of the important aspects of dealing with a pandemic.  Last week I quoted Mr. Ryan, who said that we still had time to change in March last year.  He reluctantly declared that there was a pandemic and stated that there are different aspects to this that we must deal with, namely, testing, tracing, isolation and treatment.  To my absolute horror last week, I heard a very nice doctor from UCG talking about students who had caught Covid again.  The entire conversation was about getting Covid a second time as opposed to testing, tracing and telling us how those students caught it in the first place.  No question was put to this doctor on the national airwaves and no attempt was made by the doctor to explain the lack of tracing.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure if the Minister of State will have the opportunity to answer, but she told us that all those aged 85 would be vaccinated.  Perhaps she could clarify by note whether that referred to the first or second dose of the vaccine.  I also ask her to clarify how that relates to those who are housebound.  I was contacted by a person at their wits' end who said that she is actually throwing things at the radio and the television when we are assured that everything is going well.  She said that her 90-year-old mother is housebound and has not received any vaccination because the programme that the Minister of State said would be rolled out by the national ambulance service has not been rolled out yet.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister stated that he would get back to me on the issue of call centres.  Nobody has got back to me on call centres, the cost of them and how they will work.  The people contacting me are at their wits' end.<\/p>  <p>  I have 40 seconds left.  At the outset I said that there is frustration at the constant chat about vaccination without any time being allocated to all the other aspects of the Covid pandemic.  I am also tired of hearing Deputies calling on the Taoiseach to talk to AstraZeneca.  It has utterly failed in its contractual duties.  I have no idea how such a mess was made of that contract.  Now we are going to appeal, as it were, to the bully who is stockpiling, as opposed to looking outside of the box and seeking to obtain vaccines on a non-profit basis in the future.  We will face other variants and more epidemics.  Why do we not look at the example of Cuba?  It has a population of 9 million and seems to have a very low death rate.  Have we talked to its government?  I understand that five vaccines are in development there, one of which is to be rolled out in July on a non-profit basis.  Are there other examples we can look at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500013#L00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1616672400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>As we wrap up, I will speak on two different issues.  One concerns the housebound individuals to whom Deputy Connolly referred.  I will provide an update on how the roll-out is working for that cohort.<\/p>  <p>  GP practices receive guidance from the HSE home vaccination programme for the over 70s who are housebound.  They have the responsibility of referring eligible patients who require this service.  We assumed that there would be approximately 1,500 people in this group, but 2,000 people aged over 70 have been referred for home vaccination.<\/p>  <p>  The housebound vaccination programme started on 12 March, so it is now in its second week.  By the end of this week, 740 people will have been vaccinated.  Dose one of the vaccine has been administered to patients in Dublin city and county, the north-east and the midlands.  Vaccination commenced in the south-east this week.  In the next two weeks, the programme will expand to the west and south.  All first doses are expected to be administered throughout the country in early April.<\/p>  <p>  I will specify how the roll-out was determined.  The roll-out of the programme is a significant logistical challenge.  A decision was made that the national ambulance service would roll out the vaccines.  There are dedicated regional teams in each area that are rolling out the vaccine.  I wish to thank the service.  This is a slower process than when a patient attends a clinic or a mass vaccination centre, because these people are very vulnerable and they are housebound.  I have said it many times previously, but I want to emphasise that nobody will be left behind.  We are getting through the first doses.  To reiterate, 740 out of 2,000 people eligible will be vaccinated by the end of the week.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move on to nursing homes.  The prioritisation of those in nursing homes and long-term residential care facilities has proven to be the right approach, as those most at risk of a bad outcome or serious illness or death from Covid.  I acknowledge Members have questioned how prioritisation is determined, but along with my colleagues, I fervently believe that prioritisation for those most at risk of Covid has to be based on clear medical and clinical guidelines.  It can never be determined by politicians.  As a result of a very successful roll-out of the vaccine in nursing homes, 99% of residents and more than 90% of staff have been vaccinated.<\/p> <p>As a result, visitations resumed last Monday, 22 March, for people living in nursing homes, which was really welcome.  Residents may now be facilitated to receive two visits per week on general compassionate grounds, commencing two weeks after their full vaccination.  That is the norm in nursing homes.  There is no requirement to limit visits to less than one hour.  I want to state that categorically.  The new provision is an increase from the current guidelines, under which one visit per resident was facilitated every two weeks.<\/p> <p> In addition, it is not required that the same family members are listed to visit.  For example, in the case of a family of six siblings and where the mum or dad is in a nursing home, it does not have to be the same two siblings who visit every week.  The visitors can rotate.  I am aware that some nursing homes are taking a cautious approach and saying that it must be the same two dedicated family members, but that is not the requirement.  There is no obligation that it must be the same two family members making the weekly visits.  I am asking all nursing homes to support and implement these new visitation guidelines, which are in line with existing public health guidance and advice.  Vigilance in regard to general infection prevention measures must be maintained.  The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerge.<\/p> <p> We have taken a cautious approach regarding nursing homes.  The pandemic bore down really hard on them.  A total of 88% of those who lost their lives from Covid were aged over 70 and more than half of all who died were in the nursing home sector.  We must continue to take a cautious approach.  As of today, there are 68 open outbreaks of Covid in nursing homes but they are not of the scale as was the case previously.  A lot of the cases are now asymptomatic.  I will end on a good note by pointing to how successful the vaccination programme in nursing homes and long-term residential care facilities has been.  Last week, in round 9 of serial testing, of the 40,423 people who were tested, only 81 cases of Covid were detected, which is 0.2% of the total.  That is really positive news for all those who have worked so hard in the sector for the past 12 months.  I compliment everyone involved.  There have been very difficult, traumatic and lonely days and it has been really tough on residents, families and staff.  When we see how successful the vaccination programme has been in nursing homes, it shows there is light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500013#L00400","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616673000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>If I may, I will use the time left to me to address some of the issues raised by Deputy Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500014#M00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1616673000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Deputy Colm Burke raised a couple of issues and left ample time for a response, but the Minister ran out of time.

However, I take the Deputy's points very much on board.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the distribution of vaccines to GPs, I hope Deputy Connolly will not mind me referring to the GPs who have said positive things about it.  There has been a lot of coverage of GPs who did not get the vaccines when they should have.  Sometimes that was unavoidable because supply from the pharmaceutical companies did not come in, but sometimes, particularly in the initial few weeks, the system was not flawless.  Improvements were needed and a lot of things have since been put in place.  I would like to apologise to the Deputy because I committed two weeks ago to get answers for her on the call centre.  She should have had those answers and we will chase them up for her.  The GP model is working well.  It is not flawless but we are hearing very positive things in terms of the call centre that has been put in place and the improvements to the supply.  A week of notice is now given to GPs.  There will always continue to be wrinkles for individual GPs as supply goes up and down and we manage what is a very complex logistical operation.  We must always endeavour to get it as right as is possible and continue to learn.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding people aged 85 and over, I can confirm to the Deputy that this cohort has now been very largely vaccinated.  Within the three-week period we set, approximately 99% of that cohort was vaccinated by GPs.  As the Minister of State said, the national ambulance service is engaged this week in a national programme of vaccinating those who are housebound.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Deputy Connolly, quite rightly, called for a wider debate.  We debate the vaccines roll-out regularly in this House for the understandable reason that it is such an important part of our response to Covid.  Within healthcare, there are, in essence, three things we are focusing on right now.  The context is that huge progress has been made and we now have one of the lowest Covid rates in Europe.  We have to protect that progress.  As we know, cases have stalled.  The question then is what we are doing to address that.  As I said, there are three big areas of focus.  The first is on targeting suppression of the virus in Ireland.  Today, for example, we have opened five walk-in PCR testing centres.  We are engaging locally with communities, as well as with unions and the employment sector, to look at work commutes and health and safety within the workplace to target cases associated with commutes to work.  The second thing we are doing is further strengthening biosecurity at our borders to protect against variants.  The latest measure this week is the launch of hotel quarantining.  The third action, which has been the focus of today's debate, is that we are vaccinating as quickly as possible.  We are fighting for every single vaccine we can get and we are ensuring that those vaccines are administered as quickly as they come into the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500014#M00700","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616673000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.57 a.m. and resumed at 12.01 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1616673600,"counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500015#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1616673600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Feicimid go bhfuil sonra&iacute; foilsithe ag \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" maidir le baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n sonraithe de chuid na Ranna Sl&aacute;inte ar ph&aacute;iste a raibh uathachas agus m&iacute;chumais fhoghlamtha eile orthu le sm&aacute;l a chur orthu agus ar a gcuid teaghlach.

Cad a bh&iacute; ar eolas aige agus c&eacute;n uair?<\/p>  <p>  This morning the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme published shocking revelations stemming from the disclosures of a whistleblower in the Department of Health.  This relates to children with autism whose families have fought to ensure their children got proper access to services to which they should have been entitled.  Unbeknown to these families and the children, the Department of Health had been gathering information on them for many years, specifically to defend legal cases the families considered bringing to vindicate the rights of the children's access to services.<\/p>  <p>  It is truly and absolutely shocking that this is and was going on.  It highlights an attitude of suspicion and contempt towards families that is simply unjustifiable.  This information on file in the Department's database includes detailed medical and personal information that any right-thinking person would believe is covered by doctor-patient confidentiality.  Instead of assisting families in accessing proper services for children with a disability or a learning difficulty, we had instead the Department of Health playing private investigator, trying to dig up dirt on parents who had already been through the mill.  The information that was gathered is clearly very sensitive, intimate and, very often, completely unrelated to any litigation.  It is at the very least invasive and disproportionate.  In reality it is dishonest, totally unethical and possibly illegal.  It represents a monumental breach of trust.<\/p>  <p>  The database in which this information is stored, despite its incredible sensitivity, is available to a whole division in the Department of Health for access.  It includes items such as reports from schools, details of psychiatric consultations involving children, and videos of children in a distressed state.  It is absolutely alarming that personal information, which parents gave in confidence to their child's doctor at a time of family crisis, would be collated by the Department of Health in this manner to be used against the families as a tactic in litigation to prevent families getting the additional supports they sought.<\/p>  <p>  The severity of this is, quite frankly, unquantifiable.  There are many questions we all need answered.  We know the whistleblower in question raised concerns with bosses in the Department of Health.  Does the T&aacute;naiste know when that was?  Who was the Minister with responsibility for health at the time?  Was that Minister informed of the fact a protected disclosure was made by the whistleblower last year?<\/p>  <p>  This practice has clearly gone on for many years in the Department of Health.  As a former Minister, did the T&aacute;naiste know this practice was ongoing and the Department was gathering this type of sensitive information, which it had no right to access in the first place?  It told doctors not to tell families that this information was being provided to the Department.  Was the T&aacute;naiste aware of this practice when he was Taoiseach?  Was he made aware of it?  Will the internal examination by the Department of Health into this practice be made public?  Is this practice of gathering private information, none of which could be considered relevant to possible litigation, still ongoing in the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500015#N00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1616673600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I read about this morning on the RT&Eacute; news website.

I do not know all the facts but I will watch the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme tonight.

Leaving aside the kite-flying that has been entirely unhelpful in recent weeks, the question for the Government is what exact steps it will take to address this problem to drive down numbers and allow some level of opening society and the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of people have severely restricted their movements and lives in what can only be described as a major national effort to limit the spread of the virus.  However, increasingly, there is a sense that the Government has not played its part or done as it promised.<\/p> <p> I will raise a number of key actions required and actions promised by Government.  I seek the T&aacute;naiste's response and the reasons for the Government's inaction across these various areas.  First, why has the Government not addressed the long-standing issues with the under-resourcing of public health doctors?  Every time I have raised this over the past 15 months, there have been promises but the matter remains unresolved.  Public health doctors are critical in a pandemic.  It is indefensible that this has not been resolved.  Related to this is the lack of retrospective tracing to establish where exactly transmission is taking place.  It is a basic thing and it beggars belief that it is not being done.<\/p> <p> The issue of travel is arguably the biggest failure in the response to Covid.  People have been instructed that they must only travel for essential reasons yet, inexplicably, the Government has stopped asking international travellers about this since 7 February.  That week, 46% of people were travelling for non-essential reasons.  Since then, we have no idea why people are travelling.  On so-called home quarantining, the garda&iacute; have only just established pilot projects in six divisions for enforcement purposes.  Mandatory hotel quarantining was finally introduced this week.  Who exactly is responsible for security?  Is it the hotels, the security companies, the garda&iacute; or the Defence Forces?<\/p> <p> On vaccinations, when will the Government publish the detailed plan for the mass vaccination programme?  What is the revised vaccination target for the end of the first quarter this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500015#N00600","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616674200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will do my best to answer as many questions as I can and, where I do not know the answer, I will ask the Minister for Health to correspond with the Deputy directly.<\/p>  <p>  We are approaching 4,700 deaths in this State of people who died with Covid.  We have reached the point where as many people have died from Covid-19 this year as did in all of last year.  That is an extraordinary statistic, when one thinks about it.  These are not just statistics but people with grieving families.  That statistic demonstrates how serious the B.1.1.7. variant is and how different it is to the Wuhan strain or the wild strain that we dealt with last year.  It perhaps demonstrates that getting down to low figures like ten, 50 or even 100 per day is not a prospect in the way it was last year because the virus has mutated and is more transmissible and deadly than the original wild strain.  Despite the enormous efforts of the Irish people, who are doing all the right things, we have got stuck around 500 or 600 cases per day and it is hard to see how we will get much lower than that.<\/p>  <p>  What are the things we are doing to attempt to reduce the numbers?  We have increased border biosecurity.  It is now the strictest in the European Union, with mandatory hotel quarantine starting tomorrow for people coming from more than 30 countries and anyone coming without a negative test from any country, including non-essential and essential travel.  We will add many countries to that list in the coming weeks, once we have the system up and running.

We are speeding up the vaccine roll-out.  We have given more than 700,000 vaccines at this stage.  We expect to receive more than 1 million vaccines by the end of this month but they will not all be in people's arms.  It will probably be around 800,000, and another 1 million or so in April.  We will have the report on antigen testing soon and that will be used in outbreaks in other places like work places.  We are increasing our testing and tracing capacity and there has never been any restriction on resources in terms of taking on contact tracers or people in public health departments.  We have always said to NPHET, the Department of Health and the HSE that this is probably the cheapest thing we could do.  It much cheaper than the pandemic unemployment payment or the wage subsidy scheme to take on public health staff and contact tracers.  There has never been a restriction on that.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the question on public health doctors, I believe this should be a consultant-led service and negotiations are under way between the Government and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, about that.  Should the IMO wish to refer those discussions to the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court, both of which are under my remit, we would be happy to hear the case.  Let us not be too simplistic about this.  There are a lot of public health doctors in Scotland, England and Wales, many of them consultants.  Yet their death rate and case rates are way higher than here.  Let us not suggest that will be a silver bullet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500016#O00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1616674200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I think the T&aacute;naiste was really disingenuous in the answer he gave there.

How can he expect the public to stay with the Government and to stay the course when the Government is not doing what it said it would do?  I listed all of those things.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the new variants.  They are the big threat and they change everything.  However, they have been allowed into this country by the failure of the Government to address the issue of travel.  There was a basic question on people's reason for travel and the Government stopped asking people that.  How can people have faith in the Government if it will not address the things it has promised to do for the last 12 months?  The Government has to do much better.

Unfortunately, it would have inevitably come into the country.  It does not just come through ports and airports.  It also comes in, and came in, through Northern Ireland, as did the Spanish strain which contributed to the second wave.

Our regional cities are important.  We are told Cork, Limerick and Waterford cities are instrumental to this new vision.  The cities need to be connected to achieve economic growth and to access ports and airports.  Tipperary County Council, Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council and Kilkenny County Council have made submissions on the upgrading of the N24 to motorway standard as part of the Ireland 2040 vision.  Submissions were made by Tipperary County Council on the mid-term review of capital projects and the voluntary Cork-Limerick Alliance Group also made submissions.  It is important these people are listened to.  We can get to Cahir from Limerick and on to Cork or Dublin with a maximum delay of nine to 12 minutes.  It is an investment of &euro;3.8 billion to undertake that development as opposed to &euro;10.3 billion in capital expenditure to do the M25 and the M20 motorways, not to mention the damage and impact on the environment and everything else.  It brings negligible travel time differences and transport 2040 goals will be met in a fraction of the time.<\/p>  <p>  There will a greater return on investment on the M8, which is totally underused and was probably at 50% capacity pre-Covid.  It will create regional access to the motorway infrastructure and lead to fewer cars on the N20 and N25.  Faster port access is vital, considering Brexit and related issues.  Connecting the ports of Galway and Foynes and on to Rosslare and Waterford is vital with Brexit.<\/p> <p>This document is lovely.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look at an independent evaluation of the proposal for the M25 to go from Limerick to Cork.  We can do it for a fraction of the cost.  Cahir is the central crossroads in Munster, certainly, and almost in Ireland.  We could have a digital hub for heavy industries and, indeed, all kinds of industry. The town is adjacent to two motorways, namely, the M8 and M24.<\/p> <p> We do not want another children's hospital that started out at &euro;600 million, is now almost at &euro;3 billion, is still not built and has had huge delays almost a half-decade later than delivery.  This can be delivered.  The people, energy, enthusiasm and expertise are out there.  They are not all confined to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Department.  People have good ideas that should be listened to.  Connect Limerick to Cahir and on to bypass Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and on to Waterford and Piltown in County Kilkenny, which is a notorious spot that has had several fatalities.  Please go back and re-examine this before it is too late and try to develop this link.

As he will be aware, Project Ireland 2040: National Development Plan 2018-2027 is currently under review.  We expect to be in a position to publish the revised and updated national development plan in the summer, most likely in June or July.  That will project out to 2030 in terms of the major infrastructure projects we intend to progress during that period.<\/p>  <p>  It has been a long-standing objective of successive governments to connect all our cities by motorway or by high-quality road.  We have made enormous progress in that regard in the last couple of decades.  One thing we need to bear in mind, particularly taking into account the need for climate action, is that we need to now look at this in the round.  Connecting cities can be done in two ways: by rail and by road.  We need, therefore, to weigh up options in terms of closer and faster connections by rail as well as by road, and ideally both.  We also need to bear in mind that when we progress these projects, it is not just about connecting the cities but also bypassing the towns along the way.  If I understood him correctly, I believe the Deputy suggested that the link should be from Cahir to Limerick, and that could double as the link from Cork to Limerick.  That is true, but it does nothing for Buttevant or Charleville, towns which are heavily congested and need to be bypassed and relieved of that traffic.  There is also the issue of Foynes, Adare and Kilmallock, which are linked into road projects between Cork and Limerick, such as the Foynes to Limerick road which includes the Adare bypass.<\/p>  <p>  All this, therefore, must be looked at in the round as we seek to review the national development plan.  The programme for Government gives a clear commitment that new investment in transport will be split 2:1 in favour of public transport, with two thirds of the money going into public transport and one third going into new road developments.  What is absolutely certain, however, is that there will not be enough money to do all the projects we would like, whether it is all the public transport projects in the cities or all the road projects in cities, towns and counties around Ireland.  We will, therefore, need to make some choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500017#P00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1616674800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I do not have any issue with those towns the T&aacute;naiste mentioned in counties Cork and Limerick; they need bypasses.

It is &euro;3.8 billion versus &euro;10.3 billion.  That is &euro;3.8 billion to go from Limerick to Cahir and on to Waterford with connectivity back to Cork or Dublin against &euro;10.3 billion to do the Cork-Limerick, and indeed, Cork-Waterford roads.  It is a no-brainer with the impact on the environment and so forth.  Of course, we have a reasonable rail service that needs to be upgraded.  Certainly, however, this must be re-examined in this timely review because if we get connectivity to those cities, the people in those places mentioned by the T&aacute;naiste - Adare and all the other towns - will have less and less traffic because all the heavy trucks will be gone.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly and most importantly, Tipperary town is completely jammed with lorries.  We must get the trucks out.  There is extra traffic now because they are going to Rosslare instead of Dublin as a result of the issues with Brexit in different ports.

When I was Minister with responsibility for transport, I remember working very hard with the then Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, who is in the Chamber, to save those rail lines mentioned by the Deputy in Munster and County Tipperary and put forward a proposal for a one-way system or bypass for the town, which councillors decided against.

Sixteen different factories, to name but a few, are printed in terms of price every week.  Funnily enough, however, the same price is there for each and every one of them.  As they say in rural Ireland, there is not a breadth of a hair between them, ironically enough, even though meat is going to different parts and different contracts, be it in Ireland or Europe.  Drilling down into this very good information, especially around 7 February 2021, it shows heifers were quoted at &euro;3.75 and cows at &euro;2.90.  Drilling down more, it is seen that in certain parts of the country, especially in the south, one factory ended up on the price of &euro;4.48.  A person does not have to be a mathematician to take out all the bonuses and see that the price would have to be around &euro;4 to &euro;4.10.  Ironically enough, however, it has been stated to me from information I received that beef feedlots are what brought in a large amount of cattle that week.

I know the price of beef and volatility of beef prices is causing enormous concern for farmers and rural communities throughout Ireland.  The Government is aware that recent price volatility in the beef sector is causing huge difficulties.  We are conscious that the sector is especially exposed due to factors such as Brexit and Covid-19 given its resilience and reliance on international trade and the food service and hospitality markets.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, prices for beef and other commodities are commercial matters which the Government has no role in fixing.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and his Department are working to ensure that businesses and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, as well as ensuring that payments and commercial activities necessary to protect farm incomes continue.  The Department is also working to ensure Irish beef has access to as many high value markets around the world as possible.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, are today having virtual meetings with customers in China, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> The nature of all markets is that prices will fluctuate, especially in the case of a market disturbance.  That has been evidenced during the Covid crisis and also the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.  The Government provides a range of financial aids to help beef farm incomes, as well as to support economic and environmental efficiency.  These include the &euro;300 million beef data and genomics programme.  In addition to this, over the past two years more than &euro;200 million was made available specifically to the beef sector, including the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, and beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, schemes in 2019, along with the beef finisher payment and the beef environmental efficiency programme sucklers, BEEP-S, in 2020.  In budget 2021, &euro;85 million was allocated for specific supports for sustainable beef farming.  This included more than  &euro;40 million for the extension of the beef data genomics programme during the transition period before the next Common Agricultural Policy.  The beef sector efficiency pilot, with an allocation of &euro;40 million, and the &euro;5 million dairy beef measure were launched last week.  Considerable financial supports are going from the Government to beef farmers and, to a lesser extent, dairy farmers.<\/p> <p> The Minister has also secured &euro;6 million in the budget for promotion of the suckler beef brand abroad.  He continues to progress work around protected geographic indication status for Irish grass-fed beef.  As trade Minister, I am working on that with him.  We hope to extend this on an all-island basis in time.<\/p> <p> Bord Bia's beef market tracker includes a comparison of the prime Irish beef composite price with a comparative export benchmark price based on weighted average of our key export markets.

We will give people as much clarity as we can but we have seen on so many occasions that this virus rips up our plans.  I do not want to give people assurances for six weeks&rsquo; time that we then have to withdraw in three weeks&rsquo; time, as that is not fair either.<\/p>  <p>  On the risk profile question, this will change because of the vaccine but only 10% of people have received a shot now and it has not changed the risk profile enough at this stage.  We really need to be up around 40% to 50% of people having received one vaccine before one would see that having a meaningful impact on the R number and we are not there yet.<\/p>  <p>  On vaccine supply, I attended the European People&rsquo;s Party, EPP, summit this morning and I engaged with President von der Leyen on this.  She and we are doing everything we can to speed up supply in the second quarter of this year.  It will speed up during this quarter and she is confident that we will have between 300 million to 360 million doses in the European Union in the second quarter of this year, that is in April, May and June.  That is over 3 million doses, more than 1 million a month, coming to Ireland in that second quarter.<\/p>  <p>  On testing, as I mentioned earlier, we are now extending PCR testing on demand to five parts of the country where there is a high incidence in Dublin and in Tullamore.  A person does not need to go to a GP and can just drop in for a test.  We are also going to see greater use of antigen testing, particularly in outbreaks and in workplaces.<\/p>  <p>  We are not ready yet to treat different counties differently.  Unfortunately, there is no county in Ireland at the moment where the incidence is low enough.

Five Governments have tried to deal with it.  There is a fundamental difficulty in solving the problem.  CE supervisors appear to be seeking a public sector pension but they are not public servants.  They were never hired as public servants and did not make a contribution to the public service pension scheme throughout their working lives, in the way every other public servant does.  If we give a public sector pension to somebody who is not a public servant and who did not make public sector pension contributions, the knock-on demands would be incalculable.  This is the problem.  We need to be honest with ourselves about this and to be honest with them about it.  Perhaps we can do something prospective for future pensions.

Some companies have introduced their own labelling systems showing, for example, the quantity of greenhouse gas emitted in the process of manufacturing and shipping parts to consumers.  However, a fuller carbon inventory would attempt to itemise all greenhouse gas emissions released for the product's life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials through to its manufacture, distribution, use and eventual disposal.<\/p><p>While many consumers are willing to make more sustainable choices, they face difficulties.  Consumers need better information for sustainable purchase choice to become easier.  Currently, there are no commonly used or accepted standards on how to calculate or communicate to people a product's carbon footprint.<\/p> <p>There is a clear need for independent, verifiable and universal standards and specifications.  An understandable carbon footprint label on product packaging can empower people by enabling informed choices to be made and encouraging the purchase of goods with a lower overall environmental impact.<\/p> <p> Essentially, with this Bill, we want to make it easier for people to take small steps to help reduce their impact on the environment.  People have a strong desire to do that but to incorporate that into their regular shopping habits, people need help.  We all have our routines when going to do a shop, whether it is a weekly big shop or multiple shops.  We know where the products are and we try to get through it as quickly as possible, but we also want to make more informed choices.  If there is something easy and identifiable that we can look for, we may make the choice between, say, three products where the defining factor in our choice is its impact on the environment.  Our Bill would do this by giving the consumer such information about the impact of the product they are going to buy, offering them an opportunity to compare and contrast with other products and to choose a sustainable product, should they wish to do so.<\/p> <p> It puts the onus on companies to stop flag-flying on climate issues and will expose those which are not doing enough.  It will also expose those who are actually making a huge effort, so this should be welcomed by those companies, of which there are a great number, that are making strides in terms of reducing their carbon footprint.  However, it will expose the ones which are not, which are using unsustainable practices and which are manufacturing in such a way as to damage the environment and damage the fight against climate chaos.<\/p> <p> By putting carbon labelling on products, we are encouraging awareness of the steps we can take to slow climate change in people's everyday lives.  No one person or organisation will solve climate change.  It is all about incremental changes that we can make every day, and this Bill will empower people to do that.<\/p> <p> In the same way that people have nutritional data to manage their health, we need to provide clear carbon data so people can manage their climate impact.  Research shows that nutritional labelling reduces consumer intake of calories by almost 7% and there is a clear opportunity to empower people to do the same with their carbon footprint.  This needs to be done in conjunction with a wider information campaign on people's carbon footprint and information on the products and processes they use in the environment.<\/p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention the publication this week of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.  There are elements to it that we have welcomed and it has been strengthened, of that there is no doubt.  We in the Labour Party look forward to it coming before the D&aacute;il for further discussion.  We believe our standards Bill, although it is a stand-alone Bill, and depending on what way the Government views it, and we hope it will view it in a positive way, is something that can help in the fight for climate justice.  We may be incorporating it with the Government&rsquo;s climate Bill through amendments, so we will keep that option open.<\/p> <p> I thank the House for the opportunity to introduce the Bill.  We hope it will progress to Second Stage in the not-too-distant future and we can discuss it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500021#T01500","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616677800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1616677800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616677800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1616677800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1616677800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U00600","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616677800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1616677800,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616677800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1616677800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I want to reflect on a number of issues that were raised in the earlier part of the debate.

None of the claims, even late last year, that renters would be thrown to the wolves, that Fianna F&aacute;il was not protecting renters or that we were putting people at risk, have come to pass.  I would say to those Deputies that this Bill is extending protection for renters.  The 5 km protection, as long as that stays in place, protects renters, and other legislation was introduced prior to Christmas which also protects renters.<\/p>  <p>  Who does it not protect?  It is clear from the sections of the Bill that deal with this that the people it does not protect are those who refuse to pay rent even though they have not been financially impacted, who refuse to engage in a process to resolve this or who are engaged in areas like anti-social behaviour.  We want to protect renters and we have protected renters, but that should not mean there is a blank cheque for people not to pay their rent when they have not been financially impacted by the crisis.  They should not be protected if they are engaged in anti-social behaviour, such as illegal drug dealing, the unofficial sale of alcohol or other anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for protecting renters and for again bringing this forward.  As to the point on why it is only three months, Opposition Deputies in this House state continually that we need a referendum on the right to housing.  I agree and so does the Minister.  However, they cannot have their cake and eat it and pretend this is not needed when the Minister can only introduce a three-month ban.  There is a constitutional issue that needs to be dealt with, and that is why the three months is there.  They should not pretend in this House that does not exist when they are seeking a longer period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U01000","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1616677800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>In 2002, as I have learned, 560 council homes were built or acquired across County Donegal.

It is an attempt to suggest the Government is trying to protect tenants in the midst of the Covid pandemic when, in reality, apart from a tiny cohort of tenants for whom protections will be extended, literally a few hundred tenants, the Government&rsquo;s real intention is, as of 5 April, to allow vulture funds and landlords to evict people in the midst of a pandemic purely on the grounds that the 5 km rule has changed.  That simple fact seems to escape Deputy McAuliffe and it seems to escape the Minister, despite the fact I have repeatedly cited for four years now, including on multiple occasions with the current Minister, the example of St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is just one example of what happens when tenants are persecuted for profit by vulture funds and of the failure of the Government and successive Governments to put in place protections for those tenants, who have not done anything wrong.<\/p> <p>They have not committed anti-social behaviour and have always paid their rent.  They simply have the misfortune to live in an apartment complex, many of them for up to 20 years, which was unloaded by NAMA into the hands of one vulture fund and then another, as happened with many properties across this city and country.  These vulture funds have persecuted the tenants for profit and for no other reason.  First, they tried to put up the rent by 60% but failed.  Then they tried to evict tenants on the grounds of substantial refurbishment when, of course, there was no need to evict them to refurbish the complex.  Next they tried to evict tenants <i>en masse<\/i>.  Ten have effectively been driven out over two years, persecuted by anxiety and hardship.  The funds then tried to evict the remaining ten tenants but luckily, they fell foul of the Tyrrellstown amendment.  Weeks later, they came back and said that they could not evict ten tenants because of the Tyrrellstown amendment but would evict eight.  It is not as if anybody believes that the other two evictions will not follow immediately afterwards, given that the fund tried to evict all tenants on two previous occasions.  I went to the RTB with those residents on numerous occasions.  The barrister representing Mill Street Projects Limited, the vulture fund involved here said &quot;This is ugly.  This isn't very pleasant but our owner has to maximise the value of the property&quot;.  The fund has sat on the ten apartments from which it managed to drive tenants out, through sheer anxiety.  Those apartments have been sitting empty for two years.  As of 5 April, the remaining tenants will have ten days before they are evicted in the midst of a pandemic.<br\/><br\/>The preamble to this Bill says that the Government does not want to worsen the public health situation and that evictions could contribute negatively to the transmission of Covid-19 and of course they could.  That is absolutely right.  These people will be, and some are already, knocking on the door of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and engaging with its homeless services.  We are talking here about families and individuals, some of whom are pensioners but the Government is not protecting them, which is what it should be doing.  Neither is it protecting thousands of others like them.  The suggestion is that when the 5 km restriction is lifted, it will be easier for them to find alternative accommodation in south Dublin or even in Wicklow or Wexford at the rents they are currently paying, of approximately &euro;1,000 per month.  These rents are high but what will they go up to, given that average rents in the area are approximately &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,200 per month?  Where are these people going to find somewhere to live?  The Government is failing to protect them and many other tenants like them.  It is not extending protections to such tenants.<br\/><br\/>We have tabled amendments to the Bill that provide for Covid-related protections to be extended until April 2022 for all tenants who could face eviction through no fault of their own.  We have no idea when this pandemic is going to end, particularly given the mess the Government is making of the vaccine roll out.  Beyond that, and in the intervening period, our amendments provide that the Government starts protecting tenants, full stop.  Why should vulture funds, under any circumstances, be able to evict people just because they want to increase the value of their property?  They simply should not be able to do so.  Tenants should have security of tenure.  Funds can sell or refurbish properties with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>, which is standard practice across Europe.<br\/><br\/>This Government is not willing to protect tenants because it has courted, facilitated and encouraged vulture funds and others who want to make profit from property, regardless of the human consequences for those who live in the property.  It is absolutely disgusting, frankly, the stress and pressure that residents of St. Helen's Court have undergone for four years at the hands of vicious, ruthless, inhumane, profit-driven entities.  These entities do not give a damn about human beings.  I have asked this and previous Governments, again and again, to protect tenants like these but they simply will not do it.  It is absolutely enraging, especially when the Minister has the cheek to come in here and suggest that this Bill is protecting a significant cohort of tenants.  It will protect the few hundred who can jump through the hoops and show that they haves suffered direct, Covid-related income loss and are on the PUP but the vast majority of people who could face eviction will not get any protection under this Bill and will potentially be thrown to the wolves on 5 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500022#U01300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616678400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given the green light to and granted planning permission for Ireland's tallest building.

It will have a pulling and dragging effect and will push up the general price of rent in the city.  What does that mean?  We found out yesterday from the RTB that year on year, Cork city saw a 4.5% increase in rents last year.  There was a 4.5% increase in the middle of a global pandemic.  The greed of landlords in this country and in Cork city in particular, has to be seen to be believed.  An increase of 4.5% in the middle of a global pandemic begs the question as to what rents will be when the pandemic ends and landlords have more of an opportunity to jack up the price of rent.  This shows the need to have a ban on evictions and on rent increases that stays in place and is not lifted when the 5 km travel restriction is lifted.  Such a ban should not be lifted in the short term, which is what the Government is aiming at with this Bill.  We need to keep the ban on evictions and rent increases in place.

It is incomprehensible that given the length and depth of the housing crisis in Ireland the building of homes in this country is currently deemed non-essential.  Hundreds of people have died in homelessness on the streets of our towns and cities over the last number of years.  Many more will lose their lives over the next number of years if this Government does not get serious with the building of family homes.  The building of homes has been disrupted massively by Covid-19 and construction is practically non-existent in 2021.  Every week that sites are closed, some 800 homes are not built.  I ask the Minister to think about that.  This is 10,000 houses that have not been built this year.  This is 10,000 homes.  At the same time Focus Ireland states that there are 8,313 people who are homeless in the State.  That we cannot join the dots between the massive need that exists in the State and the provision of homes is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  The cessation of construction will decimate the supply of properties in an already under-supplied housing market.  Failure to reopen the construction sector will lead to an increase in rents, an increase in house prices and an increase in homelessness.  It will also lead to increased deaths in the future and all the misery that entails.  There is already an under-supply of all forms of housing.  Continuing the Government's blanket lockdown in this area is, in my view, nonsensical.  I have spoken to workers in the sector.  There is an abject fear that jobs and livelihoods will continue to be lost and that it will be very difficult to rejuvenate or kick-start the sector again in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to be forensic.  We need to make sure to protect workers and protect every single person who works on a building site, but we have a situation where the State is allowing for social housing to be built, which I welcome.  How is the building of a private house any more dangerous than the building of a social house?  The truth of the matter is that all of those houses go into the same pot of housing supply.  They all affect the rents, the house prices and the ability for people to get homes.<\/p>  <p>  Contrast this State's attitude towards the blanket banning of construction and that of Germany.  Ireland has had nearly 190 days of lockdown, which is more than any other EU country.  Ireland is an outlier in this.  No other Government in the European Union has tackled Covid with a complete reliance on blanket lockdowns.  They have used other tools and have allowed for forensic restrictions to exist so that issues of real importance, such as home building, can happen.  A brickie, a plasterer or a chippy can work outside on a house, or maybe in a well-ventilated house that has not yet got its windows.  They can work together in small, well-organised bubbles to make sure they get the job done in a safe manner.  We need to make sure that we get back to this very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Of course we must be conscious of the threat of Covid, but it is an incredible situation that in my Meath constituency people who are single are waiting 12, 13, 14 and 15 years on the housing list for a home.  How can it be right for any human being to apply for a home at 45 years old and possibly get a home when he or she is 62 or 63?  It does not make sense at all.  It shows that we need to get real about building homes in Ireland.  We 100% need to protect people on construction sites.  There is no doubt that those who have underlying health issues, or who have vulnerable people at home, should be allowed to stay at home.  Ignoring the warning signs in the housing sector will have enormous consequences for those hundreds of thousands of people who are in severe housing distress today.  The Government needs to get forensic with how it handles this.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn now to how the Government has been dealing with the vulture funds over the past number of years.  The vulture funds have had massive access into the Department of Finance.  They have paid very little tax in Ireland.  They have been allowed to distort the housing market.  We have large international companies buying up lots of stock in the rental market, thereby having massive control over the rates and rents.  We need to make sure this power is taken from them.  We need to equalise the system so that families who need to pay rent to get a home can pay a rent that is not excessive so they are not in danger of being thrown out on their ear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500024#W00400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1616679000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Rental tenancies have become a very emotive subject over the past 20 years in Ireland with the fallout of the Celtic tiger followed by an economic upswing, which failed to deliver a commensurate rise in new house building and residential property supply.  Even before Covid, rents were on an upward trajectory requiring rent pressure zones in an effort to contain further price increases.  The Irish residential letting sector has, largely, two broad categories of rental investor.  The first is the REIT property hedge fund or vulture fund that has access to pools of investment capital and is based on large economies of scale.  The second category is the private investor who is often the accidental landlord who has inherited a property, or the future retiree who diversified his or her pension into a buy-to-let property.  A snapshot of buy-to-let properties from a 2020 fourth quarter Cental Bank report demonstrates there are significant issues facing small private landlords in Ireland today.<\/p> <p>Of a total of 96,400 residential mortgage buy-to-let accounts, arrears for 16% of the overall account were shown as follows: 19% were overdue by two to five years, 30% were in arrears five to ten years, and 13% were in arrears of more than ten years.  That scale and longevity of arrears demonstrates a failure to provide private landlords with the legal supports to terminate property letting quickly and successfully.  That is particularly true where a tenant is using all of the protections under the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, protocols, as well as other legal means to drag out the process.  That reality is removing small private landlords from the property market and, in so doing, is further constricting rental opportunity and supply.<\/p> <p> Previous Covid-19 legislation has seen Government rightly provide additional protections to tenants who find themselves in arrears as a result of Covid, including providing emergency access to welfare supports.  This Bill proposes to extend to June the provision that a tenant cannot be evicted during level 5 restrictions except where mortgage arrears have extended beyond five months.  It also continues to allow support for landlords when they register with the RTB as being unable to pay their mortgages because of the non-payment performance of tenants due to Covid-19.<\/p> <p> There has been much public discourse in Ireland around private home ownership and the rights of tenants to long-term letting agreements and fixed rent periods.  While I welcome the proposed introduction of this legislation, I remind the House that our national housing issues are largely centred on our construction capacity, the available land supply, amenable planning, and future controls on predatory pricing.  I make specific reference to governmental fees in terms of council levies, Irish Water connection charges, VAT and development fees, all of which are contributing to the spiralling cost of home ownership, whether council or privately funded, and currently amount to more than 30% of a new house build.<\/p> <p> The cost base now prevailing in the Irish house building sector is creating indebtedness for future generations as a result of having consumers invest in home buyer mortgages sold principally on exceptionally low interest rates without any understanding of what a 30-year time horizon can do to family repayment commitments.  That is a reflected image that is proving to be an economic millstone in the private rented sector also where rising rents are serving no one except professional landlords and financial institutions that continue to feast wildly on the financial arbitrage opportunities that exist in the Irish home building sector.<\/p> <p> Like many Deputies I await legislation that will seek to disrupt the financial dysfunction that permeates house building costs in Ireland today and remove the State's requirement to levy fees that will require 30- to 40-year mortgage paybacks and shared equity agreements from private sector payers.  Although this proposed Bill deals with tenancy rights in terms of Covid, the legislative conversation that will have to follow soon is the future direction of house build policy in this country.  Such analysis will have to be much wider, deeper and more radical than what we have seen previously with the mission, first, to protect our citizens by protecting our economy.  That will require the sustainability of our house build sector.<\/p> <p> I point out to the Minister also that the Regional Group issued a press statement yesterday asking for the construction sector to be reopened on the basis of using antigen testing on a two-day format protocol.  Currently, the UK Government is subsidising antigen testing and construction is open.  We believe that at this stage we must get some economic activity going in the construction sector.  It can be done safely with adequate screens and protective testing.  I ask the Minister to consider that also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500024#W00500","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616679600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Deputy Bruton is sharing time with Deputy Cathal Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500025#X00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1616679600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it forward.

There are also unacceptable cases where these systems are being abused by landlords.  However, it is fundamentally important we promote a viable tenancy sector, and the solution to this lies in the Land Development Agency in terms of the cost rentals and in the new initiatives being taken to ensure we can make tenancies affordable.<\/p>  <p>  I would warn strongly against some of the proposals advocated by others such as rent freezes, blanket bans on terminations and banning investors from buying in the market.

It is progressive legislation and is the fourth time since last summer he has brought forward such legislation before the House to protect tenants during the Covid pandemic.  Despite what others have said in terms of populist grandstanding, this legislation protects people.  I know several constituents, some of whom live close to me, who have been very much protected by this legislation to date.  It is fine to talk about blanket eviction notices and so on, but there are a minority cohort who have chosen to use the Covid pandemic as an excuse to stop paying rents and ramp up their anti-social behaviour.  What this legislation does and has done up to now is strike that delicate balance between protecting tenants and protecting those who own those properties from the properties being abused.<\/p>  <p>  The income thresholds for social housing are an issue we have spoken about many times.  I would love to see the Minister's Department progress that because the current income thresholds date back to the 2011 regulations.  They were fine at the time but we have seen such fluctuations in the market since then in the price of housing to buy and sell, in the rental market and in social and local authority housing.  We have seen the way people's incomes and everything else have fluctuated but the income thresholds have not changed in a decade.  They need to be changed.  I understand there is a memorandum in the Minister's Department.  I would love to see it progressed and come out the other end, so to speak.<\/p>  <p>  I would love to see the Minister's Department look more closely at houses in rural areas.  On any housing application form in any county, there are probably only a dozen locations where a person can tick off a box to indicate he or she wants to live there.  In between, community after community is being hollowed out.  We need to look at that.  There needs to be more spread in terms of where people are being socially housed and not ghettoise people into 100 or 200 housing developments.  We saw in decades past how that failed.  Small clusters of houses, such as the one the Department is currently planning, are the way forward in addition to more of a spread in and around counties to ensure rural areas are reinvigorated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500025#X00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1616679600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>While this legislation sets out to do something all of us would welcome in that it will protect renters and ensure they cannot be evicted because of the Covid pandemic, it also discriminates against other renters who may be evicted for other reasons.  That is the basic problem the Opposition has with the Minister's legislation.  It would be wise of him, in the interests of unity and bringing everyone in the House together, to ensure we can do something which represents everybody.  It is totally unfair that people will be put out of their home and will have to try to find alternative accommodation in a pandemic, regardless of whether their income has been reduced due to Covid.<\/p>  <p>  Other issues need to be raised with regard to social housing in particular.  Two come to my mind that the Minister needs to deal with, one of which is the level at which the housing assistance payment, HAP, is made.  Currently, in County Leitrim, a couple with one child has to find a home to rent for less than &euro;450 a month, which is impossible.  Everyone tells us that.  Another issue is that many landlords refuse to accept HAP tenants and are doing that openly.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue it is vital the Minister addresses is the level of income on which people can go onto the housing lists.  Currently, it is way too low.  People who cannot afford to rent in the private market are also excluded from going on the council housing list.  That needs to be addressed also.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, with regard to this particular legislation, the Minister needs to accept the amendments put forward by the Opposition and recognise that what all of us here must do is understand there are many people who may fall into rent arrears in a pandemic and who will have to try to find alternative accommodation.

The Minister needs to re-examine this legislation, accept the amendments put forward on it and do something about the three issues I raised, especially the HAP and the income level at which people can go on the housing lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500025#X00500","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1616679600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Deputy Nolan is sharing time with her colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500025#X00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1616679600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill.

While that is welcome, many people will be asking why we do not apply such legislative imagination to introducing more robust protections around evictions generally.

The purpose of this Bill is to extend the emergency period specified in the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 until 12 July 2021 and to provide the necessary amendments to the Act and to the Residential Tenancies Act 2020.  I welcome the Bill, under which tenants are protected in many cases and are offered 90 days notice of termination.  There are exemptions to the rule in the event of incidents of anti-social behaviour, unauthorised use of the dwelling, a threat to the fabric of dwelling or if a tenant is five months in arrears and has not submitted the relevant documents from the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service.  One should note that a tenant who has been arrears for five months is protected but if this Bill is passed in its present format, any tenant after today who is in arrears of five months or more would not be protected.  There are also exceptions for landlords where their only income is from rented property and where the landlord is under undue financial hardship.<\/p>  <p>  I am a Rural Independent Group Deputy and I am on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I came here at short notice last week to discuss this Bill.  I waited for two days for a copy of the Bill but did not receive it.  I asked the committee to sit on Wednesday through to Tuesday to discuss and scrutinise the Bill, which did not happen because it said it might not be able to get witnesses.  I, as a Rural Independent Group Deputy, offered to do that as did Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats and the Labour Party but it was refused by the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party members of the committee.  The Chairperson was completely out of order in how he spoke to every one of us about this.  My job here is to scrutinise the Bill.  My job was also to get the Bill, which I never got.  We are here to protect the renters and landlords.<\/p>  <p>  There are people who are renting properties and abusing the situation.  There are landlords who are abusing the situation.  My job on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is to scrutinise the Bill.  A vote was taken on pre-legislative scrutiny and they could not even get that right.  The vote was announced as being seven to five.  I scrutinised it and asked for it to be checked again.  When it was checked again, it was found I was right.  It was seven to six and one person was absent.  Members of the committee are there to protect everyone and to scrutinise the Bill, which I did not receive.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  We are here to protect everyone.  I welcome most of what is in the Bill but it needs to be amended.  We could have scrutinised it and got that done on time for this to be voted on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500026#Y00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1616680200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

He has agreed to look at it and to meet with officials from Tipperary County Council.  I thank him for his engagement and I wish him well in his portfolio as Minister.  He understands that he will also meet with mayor Siobh&aacute;n Ambrose later when we go through the score sheets and see what went wrong in that area.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding this Bill, it is clear what is going on.  There are some bad tenants and many good tenants.  There are some bad landlords and many good landlords.  There is always a percentage of people who abuse the situation.  Before the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, came into office, the last Government did precious little to protect people and to make sure they had certainty.  There are waiting lists of 12 years in places.  With construction closed - and there is no sense or meaning to it - expected output of new housing units will be 25% less this year.  We saw people, and even politicians, picture three construction workers getting  takeaway coffees and then brand all construction workers as rogues.  They are entitled to their coffee.  They want to go to work and to continue to build.  These same people are claiming we are not building enough houses.  They cannot have their cake and eat it.  One cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to what has gone on in the courts all through Covid, especially under one female member of the Judiciary, who I will not name and who has run riot with open engagement for vulture funds.  People have been evicted throughout the pandemic despite assurances that there would not be evictions.  There has been open door access to the courts for the vulture funds.  Land is now being sold off by banks to these vulture funds, which were invited into the country by the former Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan.  He said they were good.  The only vultures I ever see are pernicious, attacking young lambs when they are born, plucking out their eyes before they get their bodies on to the earth.  They must be brought to book.  They are plundering and raping our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500026#Y00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1616680200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I am afraid that this Bill may not protect the majority of people who are facing eviction.

They are not willing to listen to people who are desperate to hold on to their homes.  It is beyond belief that the vulture funds are being set up like this.  I fear that with the pandemic, many businesses will be scooped up by vulture funds in another two or three years.  We are at the beginning of a disaster.<\/p>  <p>  There is a housing crisis in west Cork, from Kinsale to Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Mizenhead, Bantry and Dunmanway.  People continuously come to me who cannot get housing.  Construction has not resumed, which is a crisis in itself.  People have homes wide open to the elements which have been destroyed by bad weather.  Someone has decided that construction is a danger with Covid, which it is not.  People want to move into their homes but cannot.  People in Kinsale phoned me and told me that their homes have been exposed to all sorts of weather, ruining the work and changes done already.  Many people do not want to be in social housing if they can avoid it.  They want to work to buy a house.  It is impossible for them to get loans and they are being refused.  It is important for young people to find sites so that they can build in the community that they work and live in.<\/p>  <p>  There is a disturbing matter about rezoning in Clonakilty.  There are areas of ground zoned in the town which are very important.  People have been in contact with me to say that part of that ground will be taken back in the county development plan.  That is an outrageous attack on the people of west Cork.  If that is happening in other towns in west Cork, such as Clonakilty, it will have devastating effects on an area which is in dire need of housing.  The county development plan gives an opportunity for people to get planning in an area who otherwise cannot get it for five years.  Our young people need to be looked after.  They want to build homes and to pay for their homes honestly and fairly.  I urge the Minister to look at the county development plans.  I urge Cork county councillors to seriously consider not voting if they are going to dezone ground or to vote against it if they are not going to give young people planning permission, and to stand up for the people.

Job loss brought on by Covid-19 has meant that those who were already struggling to meet high rents before the pandemic are now barely staying above water.  Sadly, many people's hopes of moving out of the rental market have been derailed by the events of the past year.  Their plans of home ownership have had to be put on hold.  Young families and working professionals in their late twenties and in their thirties have been hit hard in this pandemic and the uncertainty of being a renter has only compounded that.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of the pandemic, the Government stepped in to provide emergency legislation that froze rents and placed a temporary ban on evictions during lockdown level 5 restrictions.  It aimed to protect residents financially impacted by Covid-19 and to minimise movement while we are all subject to the 5 km restrictions.  For those whose incomes suffered as a result of the pandemic and who did not know where their next rental payment was coming from, this legislation became a real lifeline.  As we come to the end of that emergency legislation, we still find ourselves in a difficult situation and once again the Government is stepping in to protect vulnerable renters.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Bill will extend parts of the emergency provisions to ensure that protections are extended, even when the 5 km limit is extended.  This means that renters who have lost their job or income will not lose their home as well.  This time last year we could not have foreseen that we would be further extending our emergency rental response to Covid-19 for the fourth time.  It was never meant to be a permanent measure.  As the vaccine roll-out ramps up, I know that we are all hopeful that we will not be in this situation for much longer.  However, renters who have lost their job due to Covid need our assurance that they will be protected until we beat this virus.  That is exactly what the Residential Tenancies Bill will provide.<\/p>  <p>  In this last year we have been told time and again to stay at home.  For many of us, our homes have become our sanctuary and by now we are well acquainted with every inch of them.  Our homes have become a symbol of safety and somewhere to shelter from the uncertainty, and sometimes the dangers, of the outside world.  This Residential Tenancies Bill will ensure that renters who have lost their job due to Covid will not also lose their home.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is another cohort of renters that we need to support.  What about all the couples and individuals who have saved hard for their deposit and are ready to buy their own home, but whose plans have been upturned through no fault of their own because of Covid?  I am talking about the people who have their deposit saved, their mortgage approval in place and may even have an offer in on a new home.  Unfortunately, for many in this situation, their mortgage approval has been rescinded because their employer has been availing of Government supports to subsidise their wages.  These people are still working.  Most of them are still taking home the same pay and they still have their savings.  They still deserve to move on to the next stage of their lives.  I ask the Minister to commit to looking at ways of enabling people in this situation to realise their dream of owning their own home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500027#Z00100","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1616680800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome that this legislation does extend the protection for certain renters.  We all accept that we are in a brutal pandemic and it has lasted longer than anticipated.  However, we were already dealing with a huge issue, namely, the almost pandemic of ridiculous rental prices.  There were people who were already absolutely stretched in relation to making these payments.  There are people in my constituency who are paying rents of &euro;1,000, &euro;1,200 and even up to &euro;1,600 per month for relatively modest homes.  Some people were already in arrears and will not be protected.<\/p>  <p>  I beseech the Minister to look at the amendments, particularly those tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, from the point of view of rectifying this and ensuring that these protections are included.  I am talking about people who maybe do avail of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  For example, it could be the case that a child has gone from the age of 17 to 18 and suddenly the family cannot avail of the same amount of money, so they find themselves in a worse set of conditions.  We must deal with that. <\/p>  <p>  While the Minister is here, I would also like to ask him about the European report that was critical of the standards on social housing within the State.

It is being hailed as the protection for renters during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, extending protections to 12 July 2021.  However, what the Minister is not telling us is that it is an opportunity for the Government to strip rights from many renters in arrears but not affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is a short but dangerous Bill.<\/p><p>I would like to repeat the calls by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Threshold that section 2 of the Bill be deleted in its entirety.  Section 2 of the Bill will amend sections 3 and 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2020.  Therefore, even though there will be a moratorium on evictions, private renters in arrears may still be evicted.  There is either a moratorium on evictions during the pandemic or there is not.<\/p><p>Threshold has asked for further consultation to take place on the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 before any changes are made.  Obviously, that will not happen now that the debate has already started.  Threshold has stated that &quot;this Act has been very successful in preventing homelessness and precarity&quot;.  When a charity dealing with preventing homelessness from the private rental sector tells us that legislation is working, why would we change it?<\/p><p>There has been low uptake of the scheme to deal with rent arrears as provided for in the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  Threshold has noted that the rent arrears scheme is complex and that it does not provide any significant solution to tenant indebtedness.  It has stated that it is:<\/p> <blockquote> \tconcerned that there are many private renters who will not be able to avail of the protections afforded by the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 and who could be lawfully evicted during lockdown when the 5 km limit is in place. <\/blockquote>  <p>The rental market was a mess before Covid-19.  Rents were unaffordable, people were living in unsuitable, cramped and overcrowded accommodation units and most people experiencing homelessness had been evicted from the private rental sector.  Why would the Government now undo any protections in place for this cohort of renters?  Is it seeking to get the homeless figures back up to over 10,000?  It seems as if that will happen with this legislation.  Does the Government want to rob some more children of their security and homes?  I ask the Government to delete section 2 and consult with stakeholders who know what they are talking about and not just those who will make money on the back of its decisions.<\/p><p>The Government always likes to say that the Opposition or advocacy agencies never put forward any solutions to the housing and rental crisis.  We do, all the time.  It is that we do not just propose profit-producing solutions for landlords, real estate investment trusts, REITs, and investors.  Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly, policy officer at Threshold, stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tSolutions, instead of evictions, for rent arrears need to be established.  Threshold has proposed a number of solutions such as a low interest rent arrears loan fund, or a debt write off scheme in the direst of circumstances. <\/blockquote>  <p>Why does the Government continuously ignore the real-life impacts of its policy decisions?  Fianna F&aacute;il continues to talk out of both sides of its mouth.  The public-facing side says that it is protecting renters during a pandemic, but on the other side could be saying not to worry, it will get rid of those in rent arrears so that people can get new tenants and charge more.<\/p><p>I want to bring one of those real-life stories to the attention of the Minister.  I have already spoken about the housing and rental situation in Donegal.  There is scarce availability of places to rent and while the rents seem lower compared to Dublin levels, incomes are also much lower.  I would also like to support the comments of other Members in respect of the need to change the income level eligibility criteria for those waiting to get on the housing list.  I have made representations to the Minister and previous Ministers on that issue.<\/p><p>Apologies, I have lost my train of thought.<\/p><p>Where a landlord refuses to accept HAP for privately rented accommodation, it is up to the tenant to inform the relevant authorities.  That should not be the case.  It is not fair to put the tenant in that situation.  The County Council should be required to inform the relevant authorities.<\/p><p>I would like to provide an example of a woman, Ms Mary Coogan, who is trying to buy a home for herself in Dublin.  She has appeared on RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Prime Time&quot;, has written blogs and appeared on podcasts.  Mary's third house-buying blog post is entitled &quot;The Rage&quot;.  The inspiration for this blog post came from a <i>Journal.ie<\/i>article that profiled a single man looking to buy a home with a budget of &euro;600,000.<\/p> <p>That is not real life and it is not representative of people in the rental market looking to buy a home.  It is not representative of the majority of single people, couples or lone parents hoping to stop paying someone else's mortgage in the form of extortionate rent and instead own their own home and have some security for the future.<br\/><br\/>Mary Coogan has put the situation facing many renters very succinctly:<\/p><blockquote>\tSingle people are largely invisible in housing discourse...  Sure, we can be in mortgage ads happily unpacking boxes or dancing around our kitchen, but what they tend not to mention is that the happy dancer would need to either 1) be on a salary of 75k+ and\/or 2) have received a gift of min. 50-70K to get her hands on those keys.  Most of us are not on that kind of salary, and most of us don't have access to family wealth.  So what do we do?  Rent forever?  Live in a house share into our 60s?  I have saved the deposit on my own so I know I am well able to save, but no amount of skipped avocado on toast will enable me to save the 50-70k I need to get me towards a 2 bed in Dublin 12\/10. <\/blockquote> <p>It is time for the Minister to start listening to the Opposition, the advocacy and civil society groups and the many people affected by housing policies that only benefit the few.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500027#Z00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616681400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>We were supposed to learn from the Covid crisis and we were all meant to be in this together.  As I speak, I feel like we are being handed pieces of a jigsaw without an overall picture.  We had a speech this morning from the Minister for Health on the fantastic vaccination programme that did not provide an overall picture.  Now we are discussing a very specific legislative proposal but we have moved on from the lovely language of all being in it together.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with the positives.  The Bill before us is short, which is welcome.  I welcome the section that extends the timeframe for protections for tenants, but I agree with the amendments that have been tabled to extend those protections to more people.  I hope the Minister will see sense in that regard.  He delivered a speech yesterday that used the same type of language we heard this morning, encouraging us to look to a brighter day.  We do not need those types of speeches and we do not want to hear that type of thing.  People will make up their own mind based on information.  In regard to vaccinations, they want to know where the roll-out fits into an overall programme to deal with Covid.  They want to know where the protections set out in this Bill fit in as part of a housing programme that will deal with the housing crisis that has been in existence for years directly as a result of Government policies.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is back here today because of the sunset clause.  He knew that clause would run out and that he would have to come back to the House with new provisions.  I welcome his extension of the protections.  However, while one hand is extending protection to certain lucky tenants, the other hand is going to remove protection from another set of tenants.  He told us so in the lovely patriarchal language of it being for our own good and that we must balance the rights of landlords and tenants.  During the debate, antisocial behaviour was thrown into the mix.  As a former councillor and Deputy, I am a person who will not tolerate antisocial behaviour.  However, it is concerning that it was thrown into the mix by various Members in connection with the non-payment of rent.  In fairness to the Minister, he did not do so.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the justification for the lack of pre-legislative scrutiny of these provisions.  There was ample time for discussion.  In a different context, for example, a Minister of State wants an Oireachtas committee to sit almost every day to deal with the Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2019 because he is under pressure.  There is no problem with extra meetings.  I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, say there was no problem with extra meetings in regard to the Bill we are discussing now, but those meetings were not facilitated.  It is really shocking that the proposal not to waive pre-legislative scrutiny had to go to a vote in the committee.  That proposal was won by seven votes to six but the pre-legislative process was waived anyway.  I have no idea how the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, can stand over that type of scenario and say that we have a lively and healthy democracy.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is absolutely essential when there is a proposal to remove protections from some tenants.  He is shaking his head but that is what he is doing in section 2.  He has been asked by Threshold and the Simon Communities of Ireland not to do so.  They are much more expert on these issues than we are in this House.  We, as elected representatives, send people all the time to Threshold because its staff know exactly what is happening in local areas.<\/p>  <p>  To put the situation for renters in perspective, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service tells us that in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2016, the number of private renters doubled.  That is a deliberate consequence of Government policies, which have facilitated the private market.  I welcome the figure from the Minister that 70% of landlords own only one or two properties.  I am on record as saying that there is a role for those types of landlords and that we need them.  However, their rights must be balanced by a Government policy on housing that is fair and just.  The State must be in the middle of the market in providing public housing on public land.  From what I see in Galway city, it has gone beyond Dublin in terms of rent prices.  In my own area, the rent on a two-bedroom house is &euro;2,000 per month, which is beyond the ability to pay of most ordinary people earning a salary.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments that are sensibly seeking an extension of time and to leave out section 2.  I ask that he come back and work with us with a view to the Government putting forward a solution to the housing emergency that is a direct consequence, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said this morning, of dealing with homes as financial products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500028#AA00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1616681400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate.  At the outset, I want to address the matter of pre-legislative scrutiny.  Deputy Connolly noted that the committee voted on the issue and the result was seven votes to six in favour of proceeding with the scrutiny process.  We respect the committee vote.  I served on the housing committee in the previous D&aacute;il and I respect the Oireachtas committee system greatly.  It was not in any way, shape or form a slight on the committee that we sought to bypass pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is important to note that this Bill is an extension of existing legislation.<\/p><p>Having said that, I take the Deputy's point.  It is not something I would like to see done on a regular basis.  In fact, it should only happen <i>in extremis<\/i>.  I genuinely have taken on board the points Deputies have made, particularly those of members of the housing committee.  As I said, the decision to waive the pre-legislative process was not in any way meant as a slight on committee members and their expertise in scrutinising legislative proposals.  This is the fourth Bill on this issue and it is very similar to the previous Bills that were brought forward.  I certainly have noted Deputies' comments on this issue.  I reiterate that I do not want to see pre-legislative scrutiny being set aside with any degree of regularity.<\/p><p>In this instance, however, there is an urgency around the extension of protections for those who need them most.  On each occasion that I have brought forward legislation in this Chamber, I have said that if we need to do more at any stage, we will do it.  Anybody looking to arrive at a fair assessment of what we have done in regard to tenancy protections will agree that I have done exactly that.  The measures we take must be proportionate, legal and constitutional.  I have a job to do to balance the rights of tenants with the rights of property owners.  Some may wish to set that aside or dismiss it, and that is fine.  Deputy Connolly did not do so, to be fair.<\/p><p>I want to correct one point she made.  A total of 86% of landlords own one or two properties.  They are normal people and some of them depend on rent as an income.  I have to protect their rights alongside, and proportionate to, the rights of tenants.  The wilful non-payment of rent by tenants is not acceptable.  Even Deputy &Oacute; Broin said yesterday that neither her nor the Opposition in general seeks to protect anyone who wilfully refuses to pay his or her rent.  I agree with him on that point and this Bill will ensure there is clarification in that regard.  For anyone who needs help or assistance with paying rent, there are Government supports in place that are being accessed and should be accessed.  I have said that time and again.  More than &euro;11 billion of additional social welfare supports have been brought in by the Government to help people during this pandemic.<\/p><p>It behoves people to be realistic in this debate.  Last August, we brought forward new protections in the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, which some in the House opposed.  Many of those who have criticised the Bill before us voted against bringing in these protections in the first instance.  In the area of rent arrears, we introduced in that Act a new process to get MABS and the RTB involved at the first stage of arrears arising.  Before that, we never had data and assistance for people in this regard.<\/p> <p>I know right now, as Minister, that 2,401 warning letters were issued for rent arrears, as when the first rent arrears letter is issued by a landlord it must be copied to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, as well.  The tenants must also get a letter detailing what supports are in place for them.  That measure, by the way, has been very much welcomed by Threshold and others who I greatly regard and from whom I seek support and advice regularly.<\/p> <p> Let us remember that the provisions I am now thankful are in law were opposed by many of the Members opposite.  If we had gone down the road proposed by many of the Members who contributed to the debate today and yesterday, we would not have those additional supports in place for tenants right now.  The voting record is there for everybody to see.  I remind people that when we discuss this matter, we should do so with a bit of realism and honesty.  We might stop trying to play both sides that way.  Fundamentally we are ensuring a proportionate response to what is happening right now.  It is about extending further protection to the people who need it most and whose income has been affected by the pandemic, with the associated risk of going into rent arrears, or who are in rent arrears already.  Through a self-declaration, they can get protection until 12 July this year.<\/p> <p> If we need further action, I will introduce further legislation, as I have done before.  In the overall context of tenancies and rents, we are working on a package of reforms separate from the pandemic and responses we are discussing in this Bill.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Connolly, spoke of the bigger picture, and that is being addressed.  I will bring those provisions before the House later this year.  We must look at replacing rent pressure zones, RPZs, if anything is to replace them.  Work is ongoing in that space.  In the meantime, we must ensure those who need protection most will get it.<\/p> <p> Going back to the question of rent arrears, we must be realistic.  I respect what the Members opposite have said and listened to them intently, but there is a reality that, since 2018, we have seen a loss of approximately 18,000 tenancies.  Individual landlords, whether people like them or not, are leaving the market.  We are trying to build our public housing stock and deliver affordable rental and affordable purchase schemes, which I hope the Members opposite will support.  The Land Development Agency will ensure we will build on State-owned land, putting it to productive use to deliver public and affordable housing for people.  Again, some people critical of this Bill voted against that legislation also.  We are getting to the stage where those Members are against this and other provisions, so we must ask what they are for.<\/p> <p> Approximately 750 notices of terminations were issued - not effected - on the grounds of rent arrears, and that is in the context of just short of 300,000 tenancies that are in place.  That is a quarter of 1% of all tenancies.  Those notices of termination are not necessarily effected and there are additional protections under existing legislation.  From listening to Deputy Boyd Barrett in particular and others, one might swear there is no protection at all for tenants and the purpose of this Bill is really just to rip any protections out from under these tenants.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These are additional provisions.  I just ask for a fair reading of what is there.  We must act on this urgently.<\/p> <p> I remind Members there was much discussion last summer when we moved out of the blanket eviction ban introduced by the previous Government into something more sustainable.  It introduced legally robust provisions.  Again, at the time, many Members predicted a tsunami of evictions if protections were removed, but that has not come to pass.  That is not to be in any way complacent about the matters before us and we are still ensuring there are protections in place.  Many of the Members who oppose this legislation were the same who predicted a massive increase in evictions that did not happen because the protection we introduced worked.<\/p> <p> I will address something a couple of Members mentioned.  Approximately 407 individuals have sought protection under the existing Act.  Some people have said only 407 people have sought protection, so it must not be working.  Would it be better if there were 4,007 people seeking protection and we knew there were disputes and distress for them, as opposed to approximately 400 people?  It is a counter-intuitive argument and the fact the protections exist means the market knows tenants are protected.  Nevertheless, Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others are saying only 400 people are getting protection and they would much rather if 40,000 people had to sign a self-declaration about being in arrears and losing their income.  One of the reasons that has not happened is the Government support put in place through the pandemic, with the emergency rent supplement, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the more than &euro;11 billion in social welfare supports that have correctly been used to help people.<\/p> <p> Deputies cannot have it both ways.  These protections are working and all I am seeking from the D&aacute;il and the Seanad later in the week is to allow the most vulnerable and those affected by the pandemic to be protected further until 12 July.  Anybody with a fair mind looking at this would think this reasonable.  If others want to find reasons not to support this, it is up to them and I will respect that action while not agreeing with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500028#AA00300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616682000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1616682000,"counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500029#BB00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616682000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1616682000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive, are related.

I asked the Minister yesterday to correct the D&aacute;il record on the National Quality Standards Framework not being applied to private emergency accommodation.  It is regrettable he has not updated the record on that.  I can assure him I will keep raising the matter until he does because it is important we have clarity on it from the Minister with responsibility for housing.<\/p><p>I will be clear on a few points.  The Minister spoke about the opposition to the removal of the extension of the evictions ban in place since last July.  That was the position taken by the Opposition and we favoured the evictions ban being continued.  The Minister references figures, which demonstrate very clearly the highest number of evictions of families into homelessness last year after Covid-19 was in August, after the protections were removed.  It is clear and the Minister should be aware of those figures.  We should also be aware of landlords leaving the market as a direct result of Government policy and the favourable tax treatment of REITs.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that only 400 people are getting protection but Threshold has raised specific concerns about that.  It argues the arrangements introduced by the Minister have been far too complex for most people to understand and avail of.  Analysis by Threshold bears that out.<\/p> <p>Threshold are the people who are working on the front line on a day-to-day basis.  Deputy Connolly made the very good point that Threshold are the people we all refer constituents to when they need expertise and advice.  It is regrettable that many Government backbenchers have referred to issues of antisocial behaviour and tenants deliberately withholding rent to justify the changes being brought in.  No one in the Opposition supports or countenances antisocial behaviour or tenants who deliberately withhold rent.  The issue is the thousands of renters who are struggling to afford their rent and have genuine affordability issues.  The lack of protection and reduction in protections for that cohort of renters is of particular concern.<\/p> <p> My amendment and the other amendments I am speaking to seek to extend the limited protections for the limited cohort of renters through to October, at a minimum, which would give the Minister and the Department enough time to put in permanent protections for renters.  That is all the amendment seeks to do and, therefore, I urge the Minister to accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500029#BB00600","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616682600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I will speak to all of my amendments in this grouping in one go to save time.  I used the word \"Orwellian\" yesterday during Second Stage debate for elements of the Minister's speech and he has outdone himself in the Orwellian nature of his responses.  Crucially, he has ignored key concerns that many Opposition Members have expressed and that Threshold and the Simon Communities of Ireland have raised directly with all Deputies, the Minister included.<\/p>  <p>  The function of pre-legislative scrutiny is not for Deputies to have a debate, contrary to what a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher said earlier.  It is usually for us to bring in expert opinion to tease through whether the legislation in front of us does what the Minister claims it is intended to do.  That opportunity was denied in this instance.  That is particularly relevant for section 2.  While all of us have said from the outset that no protection should be given to any tenant who has the ability to pay rent and wilfully refuses to do so, we are concerned that the intention of that section is to remove protections from a much wider group of people.  We discussed some of those real-life scenarios earlier today.  Because we were denied the opportunity to have that pre-legislative scrutiny, the public did not get to hear the full detail of that scrutiny.  If the Minister had just brought forward a Bill that included section 1, we would have sailed through it yesterday and today.  We would have asked for it to be extended as the amendments in this grouping propose but we would not have any difficulties with it.  The Minister is not correct to say the Bill before us is simply a restatement of previous Bills because section 2 is a profound change.  Nobody here has any data to show the extent of the impact of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's representation of the Opposition and our opposition to the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act last year is also Orwellian.  We opposed that Act because it stripped the overwhelming majority of hard-working, hard-pressed renters of the protections the Oireachtas had unanimously agreed at the start of the pandemic.  It only provided protections for those who have experienced income loss because of Covid-19 and are on a Covid-related payment.  If the Minister had brought forward a Bill to provide greater protection, of course we would have supported that.  It was because his projections were so narrow that we could not, and rightfully would not, do that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is also disingenuous in quoting figures from the RTB.  I have the most up-to-date figures, which are more accurate than his.  The problem is that since the narrow protections for tenant in arrears due to Covid-19 income loss and on a Covid-19 payment have been introduced, 2,401 warning notices have been issued by landlords to tenants, while only 407 tenants sought protection.  That means there are almost 2,000 tenants out there, that we know of, who had warning letters.  There were 700 notices to quit but we do not know the difference between the 700 and the 2,000.  We do not know if, for example, those people were pressurised into paying more when they could not or if they voluntarily vacated the properties without taking a case because the Minister and the RTB cannot tell us that.  Of the people who between August and February received warning letters from their landlord, only a small portion availed of the protection.  That is because it is cumbersome, difficult for them to access and it completely misunderstands the disproportionate power relationship between landlords and tenants, which means that even tenants who might not be classified as vulnerable are nervous of taking cases to the RTB for fear of consequences from the landlord.<\/p>  <p>  On the section under discussion, it makes no sense to only extend the protection for that small group of renters for three months.  Nobody believes these renters will be back in work or will have fully dealt with their arrears by July.  Therefore, rather than having to rush legislation through again and possibly attach further onerous revisions to tenancy protections, why not extend it now?  Whether it is to the October date proposed by the Social Democrats, the December date proposed by me or a date next year, why not give more breathing time as is required?<\/p>  <p>  We may not get the time to discuss this later so I will say now that I think it is absolutely wrong of some Deputies to conflate the wilful non-payment of rent with significant numbers of tenants in rent arrears today through no fault of their own and who will be at risk of notices to quit and homelessness if section 2 passes.  The Minister repeatedly refuses to deal with the health impacts of forcing those tenants to look for alternative accommodation even if level 5 restrictions are lifted, but especially if they are not.  Some of those tenants could fall into homelessness.  There are direct health consequences in the context of a deadly pandemic of allowing that to happen.  That is why those groups of people should be protected.  If we had pre-legislative scrutiny of all of this, that could have been teased out.<\/p>  <p>  For the Minister and his party colleagues to claim that he is the champion of tenant rights when Bill after Bill progressively strips more of those tenants' rights from them is not credible.  Likewise, where he continues to give those small groups of tenants some protections, he makes it more difficult and cumbersome and only extends such protections for several months, increasing their anxiety.  That suggests the Minister has no real understanding of the difficulty those renters are in.<\/p>  <p>  Unless the Minister accepts our amendments, particularly the deletion of section 2, anybody on the side of renters has no choice but to oppose this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500030#CC00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1616682600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Like the other Opposition parties, we have a series of amendments, which seek to extend considerably further the protections this Bill proposes to extend only until July.  We have gone the furthest in saying they should be extended until April 2021 and I will explain why we think that is right.  We also support all the other amendments that go considerably further than the Government.  We also have amendments that oppose section 2 for the reasons that have been set out and explained by Threshold, namely, that this Bill in effect strips a cohort of people who enjoyed some protection of the protections they had under Covid.  People Before Profit has tabled another amendment, which I believe is unique to us, to extend the protections to other cohorts of tenants whom we do not believe should be evicted in the midst of a pandemic on grounds of sale, refurbishment or any other grounds.  That is the key.<\/p>  <p>  Others have called the Minister's defences \"Orwellian\".  I have called it a deception and a fraud but we are all trying to get at the same thing.  It is a deception and a fraud because the Government is presenting this Bill as if it protects tenants in the midst of Covid.<\/p> <p>In truth, it only extends protections to a tiny group for a few months.  It is the Government's policy decision that as of 5 April, the green light has been given for the rest of those tenants to be evicted in the midst of a pandemic because it has not protected them in this Bill.  That is the truth of what the Government is doing.<\/p> <p> I have tried to give the Minister the benefit of moving beyond politicking, abstract discussions to give real tangible examples.  This debate really only means anything when one applies it to real tangible examples and, of course, that is the reason the Minister does not respond.  Real people in St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have notices which say they will be evicted ten days after the 5 km rule is lifted, which is likely to happen on 5 April.  All those families and individuals have never engaged in antisocial behaviour, always paid their rent and are working people such as shop workers, carers, restaurant workers, pensioners and taxi drivers.  They are people I know personally now because I have been fighting alongside them for four years against four successive attempts by ruthless, vicious vulture funds that are trying to drive them out of their apartment complex in central D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The Minister is not protecting them.  That is the truth.  They are out, and as a result, they are already engaging with homeless services, and because no council houses are available and approximately 4,000 families are on the housing list, they will be sent to emergency homeless accommodation unless they can get housing assistance payment, HAP.  Rents in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, however, are now running at &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,200 and &euro;2,400 for two and three bedroom apartments.  Their current rents are approximately &euro;1,000.  How will they pay such rent?  They cannot, so they will be homeless.  What is the Minister going to do about it?  The answer in this Bill is \"Nothing\".  They will be knocking on the doors of homeless services.  Some of them will be sent with their children into hostels in town in conditions that will make the transmission of Covid-19 more likely, which is precisely what the Minister said this Bill is designed to prevent.  Therefore, even on public health grounds, never mind the need to protect tenants from ruthless operations such as Mill Street Projects Limited and Apollo Global Management, or whatever these wealth asset management speculators - these vicious, inhumane people - are called, the Minister is going to allow the green light for these people to be evicted.  That is why it is a deception and fraud.<\/p> <p> We are asking, therefore, effectively to reimpose the blanket ban on evictions during a pandemic.  In the meantime, we can discuss all the nuances for which the Minister is arguing.  We can sort them out.  He says it is more complicated and I agree; in some areas it is more complicated.  Let us reimpose the blanket ban that actually protected people in the midst of a pandemic and then use that intervening period to do the more nuanced stuff, which the Minister said needs to be done.  That is our argument.  If the Minister wants to protect tenants in the midst of a pandemic - people who have done nothing wrong, are not antisocial, have not generated arrears through any fault of their own or have done nothing wrong as tenants - and that is his genuine intention, he will accept the amendments put forward by the Opposition.  If he does not accept those amendments, he is, in fact, deceiving the public and this Bill is a fraud in terms of its claim to protect tenants during the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500030#CC00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616683200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I want to address a category of tenant I believe is in serious condition at the moment.  I have been contacted by a number of people who live in rented accommodation and are in difficulty with their landlord because the landlord has left the accommodation in appalling condition.  In fact, it does not meet the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  The problem is that if a tenant is not satisfied with the state of the house, and if the landlord refuses to make improvements, the tenant can and does go to the local authority and asks it to issue an improvement notice.  The difficulty then arises that the improvement notice works are limited to \"supply and delivery of essential or emergency maintenance and repair.\"  The problem, however, is really that minimum standards are what they are.  If they do not, therefore, meet the minimum standards, the landlord is required to carry out the improvement works listed because the houses are substandard and the people are living in very difficult and appalling circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty, therefore, which I ask the Minister to look at, is the issue with regard to the fact that once improvement notices are served, and in some cases authorities do not serve the notices because they do not meet that new definition, any basic standard that is not met must be met.  I believe it is essential.  It needs emergency maintenance and repair, by definition, and therefore, there should be no exclusions.  If a council writes and forms the opinion that an improvement notice is needed, and the standards for rented housing are not being met, it should be a mandatory requirement for the landlord to carry out that work forthwith.  The point some people are making here is that tenants are in great difficulties.  If the landlord refuses to do it and the council will not or cannot serve the notice, what does that tenant do?  The one thing he or she can do is withhold the rent on those grounds.  I believe he or she is right to do so and it is reasonable that he or she do that until the landlord rights the appalling wrong that has been done.  I therefore ask that when he is making regulations, the Minister could or would change the regulation that when the council forms the opinion that basic minimum standards are not being met, it will be grounds for the notice to be served and for the works to be carried out.  They would need to be exempt works under the Covid-19 regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500031#DD00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1616683200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I have taken note of the points he raised and I will engage directly with the Deputy on that.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of time, I will address the amendments in block, if that is okay.  I note that Members have also addressed their amendments in block.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive, all pretty much relate to the extension of the emergency period past 12 July.  There is a variance in that some Deputies are seeking October, some want December and other are seeking April next year.  I note that Deputy &Oacute; Broin said he will take whatever.  The approach to some legislation seems to be just to take whatever is available and it does not really matter.  Actually, it does matter.  We have a duty as a Government to ensure that anything we pass here is proportionate, legal, constitutional and is not open to challenge.<\/p>  <p>  At previous debates on tenancy legislation, the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson also said that we should test it in the courts and therefore to set aside the advice of the Attorney General and do it anyway.  That is an incredible attitude to have with regard to passing legislation and laws that govern our State.  We have an Opposition spokesperson saying we should just test it in the court and set aside any Attorney General advice, and that it does not really matter because that person knows better and that is fine.  That is not the way any legislation should be approached.<\/p> <p>It gives a view into the psyche of some Members opposite in that they will say or do anything if it is seen to advance their own position.  That is not the way we should be approaching the serious matter of protecting the most vulnerable tenants.<\/p> <p> To turn specifically to the amendments tabled, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, or 19 to 21, inclusive, which seek to increase the proposed extension in this Bill of the emergency period under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 from three months by varying lengths to provide an extension of either six months, eight and a half months or 12 months, ending on 12 October, 31 December or 12 April.  The amendments also propose consequential amendments to other dates within the Act which correspond with the various expiry dates proposed for the emergency period under the Act.<\/p> <p> Section 9(1) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 defines an emergency period as being from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021, during which the enhanced tenancy protections under the Act apply for tenants in arrears, subject to conditions and to procedural requirements.  Section 1(a) of the Residential Tenancies Bill 2021 proposes to extend the expiry date of the emergency period from 12 April 2021 to 12 July 2021.<\/p> <p> In line with the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, which I respect and regard as the main law agent of the State but others do not, which is up to them to explain why, the Government seeks to limit as much as possible any interference with the constitutionality of protected property rights.  The 86% of landlords in question are very normal people, most of whom own one property, some two.  It has not been outlawed, as far as I am aware yet, for someone to be a landlord.  While it is still legal for them to be landlords, they deserve an element of protection also.  This is about proportionality.  Again, others will set that aside and try to make a play on it.  One cannot just disregard people's rights at a whim or at the drop of a hat or if it is deemed it will get somebody airplay somewhere outside of this Chamber or a nice article in a newspaper.<\/p> <p> Covid-19 has indeed brought much uncertainty.  The Government's proposed three-month extension of the application of the enhanced tenancy protections under the Act aims to complement our wider efforts to suppress the spread of Covid-19 throughout the country.  When we debated the origins of this Act last August, even when we debated the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 in early December, none of us could have foreseen the fatal trajectory of Covid-19 on our island and across the globe.  As legislators, we need to work together to react quickly to suppress the spread of Covid-19 in everything we do, not just in government but in opposition as well.  There is a responsibility on all Members to play their part in that regard.<\/p> <p> We might need to review the situation again for tenants closer to July.  I am open to doing that, should we need to, as I have done already on three previous occasions.  I will bring forward any necessary or targeted protections for our most vulnerable tenants at that time.  I remind Members that protections under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 will help any tenant in financial difficulty while he or she is seeking income support from the State to help to pay the rent.  Tenants need to act and engage.  They are doing so, thankfully.  Organisations such as Threshold, with which I engage regularly, have been most helpful in ensuring this happens.  Tenants need to act to avoid a build-up of rent arrears.  There is no question of that.  We have State supports with emergency rent supplement and other payments.  I encourage tenants to engage in that regard should they find themselves in difficulties paying their rent.<\/p> <p> Section 1(a) to (d), inclusive, update various dates from April 2021 to July 2021 to reflect the extended emergency.  The proposed amendments in this Bill to the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 provide for enhanced protections for tenants, subject to conditions - no one is suggesting there should not be any conditionality - and procedural requirements under the Act, to continue to apply from 13 April 2021 to 12 July 2021, if they have been economically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and, consequently, are unable to meet their obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act to pay rent due and are at risk of tenancy termination.  These are the people we should be assisting.  That is what this Bill will do should it be passed.<\/p> <p> Those who oppose this Bill will be voting against extending those provisions to July this year.  Some voted against the original provisions last August and voted against them again in December of last year.  During this time and up to 12 July 2021, those tenants who need these additional protections, on top of existing tenancy protections already in place, will be safeguarded from eviction and indeed from rent increases.<\/p> <p> Section 1(b) extends the eligibility expiry date from 12 April 2021 to 12 July 2021 for tenants to qualify as a relevant person within the meaning of section 10(6) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  If this Bill is passed, a relevant person means a tenant unable to comply with his or her obligations to pay the rent due in respect of tenancy because he or she is or was at any stage between 1 August 2020 to July 2021 in receipt of, or entitled to receive, illness benefit because of a Covid-19 absence or in receipt of, or entitled to receive, the temporary wage subsidy.  Tens of thousands are in receipt of the latter.  It is another Government support in place to keep people working and connected with their jobs.  It also applies to any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19.  This includes the rent supplement or the supplementary welfare allowance.  It is abundantly clear as to what those protections are and who a qualifying person would be.<\/p> <p> If someone thinks there should be an addition to that, they should come forward.  I think we have covered as well as possible those who really need the protections.  Others will just disagree but we are used to that.<\/p> <p> Section 1(c) extends the eligibility expiry from 12 April 2021 to 12 July 2021 for landlords to qualify as a relevant person within the meaning of section 11(6) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  Pursuant to this, a relevant person means a landlord who is, or was, at any stage between 1 August 2020 to 12 July 2021 in receipt of, or is entitled to receive, illness benefit for a Covid-19 absence.  Those small mom and pop landlords also have rights.  Those rights need to be respected also.  There needs to be a proportionality between their rights and the future protections we bring in place.

This is a specific amendment.  Of course, the Minister did not respond to the point and I doubt he will but we will see.  This seeks to extend the protections that the Bill would afford to other cohorts of tenants who have done nothing wrong and who should not be evicted in the midst of a pandemic.  I have cited St. Helen's Court as a real human example.  The vulture fund that owns St. Helen's Court also owns properties in Inchicore where it has been trying to evict people.  It owns properties in Gardiner Street.  Of course, vulture funds own many properties throughout the city and country.  They are not the mom and pop landlords to which the Minister refers, and in any event whether they were or were not, these are people who have paid their rent and who are being evicted on grounds of sale or refurbishment.<\/p><p>Here is an irony for the Minister.  The tenants in St. Helen's Court would have been better off if they did not pay the rent over recent months.  Many of them are on the pandemic unemployment payment.  Many of them are in receipt of the housing assistance payment.  As they are good conscientious tenants, they pay their rent to a landlord that is trying to kick them out purely for money and the Minister refuses to protect them.  The amendment asks the Minister, if he is serious about protecting tenants from unfair evictions and evictions that are not their fault in the midst of a pandemic, to please protect tenants such as these who, in this case, have a letter that states that as soon as the 5 km restriction is lifted they will be gone in ten days.  Then they will be told by emergency services that they do not have council houses for them, that the housing assistance payment limit is too low to allow them to rent the property that is available in the area, which is &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,200, and that there is nothing for them but an address for a hostel in town where they can take themselves and their children.  It is straightforward.  If the Minister is serious about protecting these tenants will he please accept the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500034#HH03100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1616685000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because time is short.  I want to speak in favour of amendment No. 16 tabled by People Before Profit.  To speed up the process, I will withdraw amendment No. 18.  I have one point in response to the Minister.  Attorneys General are like political parties.  There are differences of opinion between different schools of law.  When many of us make proposals that are contrary to Government proposals we do so consulting legal experts as eminent, albeit with a different legal point of view, as the current Attorney General.  Therefore, many of us have strong legal advice from some of the country's most eminent constitutional law experts that the types of protections we propose are indeed possible.  Of course, legal opinions are not unlike hairdressers, whereby people like one and do not like another.  Let me be very clear that nobody in the Opposition is making proposals because we are not serious about them or because we do not believe they have legal grounding.  Our legal advice is different.  If we were in government with a different Attorney General I am sure we would be able to provide the type of protections to renters that the Government clearly will not provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500034#HH03200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1616685000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I want to put on record our support for these amendments.

The new subsection 1A of section 12 applies as per paragraph (c) of that subsection to a notice of termination grounded on rent arrears and served on a tenant during the emergency period, specifying a termination date that falls on or after 13 April 2021 and before 13 July 2021, that is, it falls during the three-month extension provided under this Bill.  Paragraph (a) of the new subsection 1A of section 12 provides that, subject to paragraph (b) of that subsection, if the tenant is protected by the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 and subsection 1A applies in their case, the specified termination date shall be deemed to be 13 July 2021.<\/p> <p> This measure provides the benefits of the enhanced protections to all relevant tenants until 13 July 2021.  To reiterate, the protections under the Act will help any tenant in financial difficulty while they are seeking income support from the State to help pay their rent.  We are abundantly clear that it is an extension of protections.<\/p> <p> To conclude, paragraph (b) of the new subsection 1A of section 12 provides that if the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 protections cease to apply in regard to a relevant tenant, the protections under paragraph (a) shall also cease to apply ten days after.  This affords a grace period for tenants to find alternative accommodation.<\/p> <p> I cannot accept amendment No. 16.  The text of the Bill and the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 have been carefully considered from a policy but, more importantly, from a legal perspective, with the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, which is the law agent of the State and of Government.  Others will say that should they be in government, they would seek to have some compliant Attorney General, but the Attorney General's job is to protect the Constitution and to uphold the law.  I certainly follow the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  These protections are carefully targeted to safeguard those tenants most in need of protection, that is, those tenants in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and who, consequently, are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Amendment No. 16 seeks to broaden the scope of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 to cover notices of termination that do not relate to rent arrears.  In line with the advice of the Attorney General, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 carefully limits and balances the constitutionally protected property rights by targeting the help at the most vulnerable tenants, as is appropriate, that is, those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 or at risk of losing their tenancy.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, this short Bill seeks to extend the existing protections under the Act for tenants in rent arrears for a further three months until 12 July 2021.  It does not propose to amend the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 in any other regard.  I cannot accept amendment No. 16 nor amendments Nos. 17 or 18, which propose to provide protections beyond 12 July 2021.  What I will do, as I have given a previous commitment to do, is ensure this is kept under review.  As we all know, this pandemic does not necessarily conform to plans that are set down.  Therefore, should I or the Government deem it appropriate to come back to review and revise the protections that are there, I will do so and I have done that in the past already.<\/p> <p> I hope that Members opposite, who opposed the original Act that affords these very important protections that they say they seek to keep and to extend, will actually support this Bill to ensure those who need the protections get those additional protections against eviction and against rent increases until July of this year.  I hope that, at this late stage, they will see fit to support and protect those who are most at risk of eviction in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500034#HH03400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1616685900,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 56;

While there is rightly an acknowledgement of women who could not avail of their full maternity leave being facilitated through the extension of parental leave, the small number of carers in receipt of carer's benefit who cannot go back to work because they are providing full-time care for someone who may still be waiting for a vaccination and worried about catching Covid-19 are not in a position to return to work.  Flexibility in this area would facilitate a handful of people throughout the country who are availing of carer's benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The bizarre situation is that they will now be forced to go back to work, which puts the disabled person or the older person at an enhanced risk of catching Covid-19 because there are more people coming into their household.  It increases the risk of someone being admitted to hospital or to ICU, putting further pressure on our health service.  The person who is already in employment, filling that position for the person who is on carer's leave, will not be able to get employment now because of the Covid restrictions and the impact of the pandemic on our economy, and will draw social welfare payments of a minimum of &euro;203 a week.  There is a net financial loss to the State of a minimum of &euro;203 a week, an increased risk to an older person or disabled person of contracting Covid-19, putting additional pressure on our overstretched health service, and all for no cost saved.  With carer's leave, there is no additional guarantee of a financial payment.<\/p>  <p>  It seems illogical that we are not providing flexibility to this small cohort of people.  I have taken this up directly with the Minister on behalf of Family Carers Ireland.  He has come back about the broader issue regarding flexibility for carer's leave.  I would be grateful if he could put his intentions in that regard on the record.  I urge him to speak with his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, to see if some flexibility could be introduced in light of the additional risk of exposure to Covid-19, the impact on our health service, and it costing the Department of Social Protection at least &euro;203 week for a small handful of people in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500039#PP00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1616687400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this point.  He has engaged with me directly about this and I have issued a response.  It is an important point.  As we work towards the full transposition of the work-life balance directive, we will have to continue to look at the position regarding carer's leave.  It is covered under Article 6 of the directive, which provides for five days of annual carer's leave for workers providing personal care or support to a relative or person living in the same household.  As the Deputy said, it is designed around trying to assist in balancing those caring responsibilities with work and potential reintegration in the workforce, or allow some compromises between the two.  We have quite a different system of carer's leave.  We currently provide for a minimum of 13 weeks and up to a maximum of 104 weeks of carer's leave for employees and an application of carer's leave for less than 13 weeks may be refused by an employer.  To avail of carer's leave currently, an employee must have worked for his or her employer for 12 months without a break in the employment.<\/p>  <p>  When one reads what is currently provided for under domestic legislation and what is provided for in the directive, they do not match up, so we will have to do further work on that.

I fundamentally believe, and think that anyone would, that children of one-parent families should have the same entitlement to time at home with a parent, which is the most important aspect of this Bill, as any other child in the State.  Is it the Minister's belief that inequality is enshrined in this Bill and that children of one-parent families will have unfair outcomes?  What remedy does he and his Department suggest so that we can support this in its current form?  This amendment, which I will push as much as I can, is about examining ways in which paid parental leave can be extended to lone parents to provide equality between one-parent and two-parent families.  That is important but beyond that, I am interested in the Minister's comments about why that has not been factored into the Bill until this point and how it will be remedied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500039#PP01400","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1616687400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 3, in which we outline a number of areas we think the Minister should report to the D&aacute;il on in a number of months.  It is good policy to have a review of this legislation because we need to understand how it impacts people and how it can be improved, so it is important that there is a continual review of the legislation that passes.  This amendment contains a number of areas that we would appreciate the Minister considering as part of that review.<\/p>  <p>  The first is about policy and budgetary analysis of potential further extension of leave under the accurate and how the EU directive relating to work-life balance is transposed, and requires a timeline for that.  We will all agree that Ireland falls well behind our European neighbours when it comes to parental leave.  It is important that we invest and are ambitious in ensuring that our parents and families have the State supports they need, especially in those early years of a child's life.  When things are tough, it is hard for parents to balance work, their family life and looking after their children.  It is important that we focus and invest strongly in those years for parents.<\/p>  <p>  There is a question about whether primary legislation was required to extend parental leave to nine weeks and whether the 2019 Act empowers the Minister to do that.  Will he say why we had to go through this process?  Over the past year, when parents were under significant pressure because of Covid and people were losing work, with uncertainty about how they would be able to manage to financially support their families, there were calls for months for us to bring this in.  Did we need to wait for this legislation to happen?  Could we not have done this and given that clarity and certainty to the parents who were calling for it?  There is an issue with us doing this piecemeal and I know that there are requirements under EU legislation.  Parents would benefit from a clear timeline for that will be rolled out.  Waiting for a week here or a week there for that to be announced is no way for parents to plan their families, finances and the support that will be available.  We know what we are required to do under EU legislation.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister clearly sets out how the Government is going to meet that requirement so that families have clarity and certainty on those supports.<\/p> <p> Section 4(2)(c) of the amendment mentions the streamlining of parental leave legislation.  At the moment there is maternity, paternity and parental leave benefit, and paid and unpaid leave.  It is an incredibly confusing system.  I imagine any new family starting to look into it would find it very difficult to navigate.  It also makes it very difficult for us as a State to measure how we are doing against other countries, because the terminologies and conditions differ, for example, in respect of whether leave is voluntary, unpaid or not.  We must streamline it.  It comes down to parental certainty and enabling parents to know what leave is available to them.  While starting a family is a fantastically exciting time, parents are exhausted and do not want to have to navigate this very bureaucratic system to find out what supports are available.  I ask the Minister to streamline the supports and the nomenclature used relating to them.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to examine ways to close the substantial gap between the end of parental leave, including paid and unpaid entitlements, and the start of early childhood education.  For any family who have a child and have benefited from accessing maternity or parental leave, there is a huge gap between that finishing and when the child is eligible for the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  During that period, parents have to pay enormous childcare fees, which are really out of kilter with what our European neighbours have to fund.  In many instances, the cost is the equivalent of another mortgage.  For parents in Ireland, there is an acceptance that this is just how things are.  They buckle down for the first few years of their children's lives, knowing they will be financially insecure during that period.  They know it will be a stressful and pressurised few years, but they buckle down and get on with it because they do not expect any more from the State.  If they were to look at our European neighbours and realise exactly how much better other countries are doing this, parents in this country would feel very aggrieved.  Currently, the gap between the end of paid and unpaid leave and the beginning of subsidised preschool in Ireland is 17.6 months, which is a considerable time.  We are outlier in that respect.  It is a pressurised enough time for parents, so we must narrow that gap and ensure supports are in place.  In 12 member states, there is no gap at all, while we have a gap of 17.6 months.<\/p> <p> Another thing we find and I have seen quite a bit is when mothers go back to work, because it is usually mothers who return to work, all their salary is going towards childcare costs.  They do it because they think that in two years' time their children will be eligible for the ECCE scheme, then start school, and they will then actually start to see some income from the work they are doing.  That is no way to live.  I ask the Minister to seek to reduce that gap.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Gannon, raised the issue of extending paid parental leave to lone parents.  When this Bill and these provisions were first discussed in the D&aacute;il, I believe the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, spoke about it.  She said that there will be an extra six weeks' leave available for families when this leave is introduced.  The Minister himself also commented at a committee meeting that there will be an extra six weeks' leave available.  They both made the assumption that there are two parents in each family.  We all know that is not the case.  Families come in all shapes and sizes and our policies and supports should reflect that.  When we are talking about paid parental leave, there are obvious benefits to a parent being able to spend time with his or her child.  However, this must be a child-centred policy and should be about a child spending time with his or her parent or parents.  In the case of lone-parent families, if a parent is managing the family on his or her own, they are in particular need of State support and for the State to give him or her the help that he or she needs.  This issue was raised before the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and was put forward as one of the recommendations.  It is a missed opportunity that the Minister did not seek to introduce a mechanism by which a lone parent could be given the two allocations of leave so that he or she would have the full entitlement of parental leave.  I ask that the Minister does that.  It is really important that we support parents who find it particularly difficult parenting alone.<\/p> <p> I also want to raise the issue of the rate of payment for this leave and encouraging people to take up this scheme.  It is an issue on which we must focus.  When the payment is being made, there is an acknowledgement and a need to make sure it is not just mothers who take up this leave.  I know that it is an issue of which the Minister is conscious.  We must ensure that when there are two parents parenting, both parents take this leave.  I do acknowledge there will be barriers in some families, particularly for some men, whether cultural or financial.  I ask the Minister to examine that on review of this Bill, looking at how the scheme is working, who is taking the leave, if it is being fully allocated, and how we can address the concerns or barriers in respect of why people may not be taking up all of this leave.<\/p> <p> I am sure Members all saw the media reports today that New Zealand has introduced paid leave for women who have suffered a miscarriage.  I ask the Minister to look into and examine the possibility of introducing such leave.  Currently, there is no provision or support for any woman who loses her baby before 24 weeks' gestation.  The options available are to take unpaid leave or sick leave.  Even the five days' bereavement leave currently available does not recognise miscarriage.  I ask the Minister to look into this issue.  A mother should not have to take sick leave when she is not sick.  The loss of a baby is an incredibly traumatic event.  It is a huge loss to any family.  Our leave and supports should recognise that.  What New Zealand has done is a very good model and it has shown real leadership with its introduction.  I ask the Minster to consider the issue.  If a woman loses a baby at ten weeks, 15 weeks or 20 weeks, it is an incredibly difficult time.  I ask the Minister to look into supporting those families when they have suffered in such a way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500039#PP01500","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616688000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I support both amendments.  They are most important.  As has been said, it is really important we review legislation after it has been introduced.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a few points about the amendment in particular.  One is the importance of a timeline on further extensions in parent's leave.  It is most important.  We have seen it last year and this year in particular.  This leave was mooted last summer, announced in the budget nearly six months ago in October, and parents had wait on its introduction.  Finally, they will be able to take this leave.  A timeline in that respect is really important and is something we should all support.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask a question on the EU work-life balance directive, which I raised yesterday, and the fact Ireland has to transpose this by June 2022.  Perhaps I picked him up wrongly, but I believe the Minister said the Government has until 2024 to introduce the nine weeks' leave in line with the requirements of the directive.  I ask the Minister to confirm that and with, that, whether that was an extension to 2024 sought by the Government rather than transposing it by June 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of lone parents, as a State we have let down lone parents and their families for decades.  This legislation is poor in that the babies of lone parents will not have the same support and time with their parent as babies in two-parent families.  That is a great shame.  We saw the changes that were made to the one-parent family payment back in 2012, and we saw the consequences of that in the Indecon report which showed those very changes made life harder for lone parents in respect of poverty and deprivation.  I hope we will not make the same mistake with this Bill, which we will if this amendment is not accepted and the Minister does not outline clearly today how he is going to resolve this issue for lone-parent families.<\/p> <p>They have been let down for far too long and the Minister should make that change in the legislation.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the rate of payment is an important aspect of this legislation.  We know there is a low take-up of parent's leave and parental leave, particularly among men, and we need to address that.  We can do so by looking at the rate of payment.  On European comparisons, it is very low relative to average wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500040#QQ00200","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616688600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for bringing forward these two amendments, which are very similar.  While I understand the intention of the Deputies in proposing that we provide a report on a review of this legislation within a year, I do not consider that to be the best approach.  I do not agree that these amendments offer the best way to proceed and I will try to explain why that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  The first issue is the proposal for a further extension of leave and the requirement to report on how that is being progressed.  I have made a commitment in this House that Ireland will meet its requirements under the EU directive to roll out the remaining four weeks of paid leave that are specified.  The directive has to be transposed into law by June 2022, as Deputy Kerrane noted.  However, it states that the last two weeks of paid leave do not have to be provided until August 2024.  This is not a derogation specific to Ireland; it applies to all member states.  The full nine weeks must be in play by August 2024 and seven weeks have to be provided for by June next year.  The current provision is five weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Whitmore asked whether this could have been done through statutory instrument.  The reason we are proceeding by way of legislation is to ensure the two-year period will apply.  This element requires legislation to enable it to be claimed in the first two years.  One year was set down in the primary legislation and we are amending that to provide for two years.  I understand the Deputy is bringing forward an amendment on that point, which we will discuss in due course.  Future extensions of the weeks of paid leave will be implemented by way of statutory instrument, which will allow this process to be aligned much more quickly with any announcement.  That is something everybody will welcome.  Those future extensions will have to be undertaken in engagement with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, who is responsible for paying the benefit, and, ultimately, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have been very clear in all my utterances of my intention that this is where my Department will be focusing in terms of supporting families over the coming years.  We will meet our requirements in this regard under the EU directive.<\/p>  <p>  The point was made that we should streamline all parental leave legislation, including that providing for maternity leave, paternity leave, parent's leave and benefit, and parental leave.  I appreciate that there is a wide variety of types of leave for parents and that this can cause some confusion.  On the other hand, it is good that all these types of leave are there to meet particular needs.  The amount of leave that is available has increased very significantly in recent years, which is welcome.  In terms of meeting the gap that was outlined between the end of maternity leave and eligibility for the ECCE scheme, I am very happy to look at how we can work to publicise in a clearer way the range of leaves that are available.  I have been engaging recently with the social partners, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and a number of employer groups, on these issues.  Indeed, this is an issue that regularly comes up in our discussions with those groups.  I am committed to examining how we can better outline to people what the various leaves are and how they can apply for them.<\/p>  <p>  When considering the gap between the end of parental leave, including paid and unpaid parental leave, and the start of the ECCE scheme, it is important to acknowledge that we are narrowing that gap, including by the significant step we are taking today, in this Bill, by extending parent's leave and unpaid parental leave.  That is extremely important in encouraging a more equal sharing of caring responsibilities between women and men.  It is also important to note that the national childcare scheme, NCS, is in place and kicks in from 24 weeks up to 36 months, or until the child qualifies for the ECCE scheme.  It is available for up to 45 hours per week at a 50 cent per hour subvention.  Families may also be eligible for an income-assessed subsidy from 24 weeks up to the age of 15.  This is set at a progressive rate of up to &euro;5.10 per hour for under-ones and &euro;4.35 for children aged one to three.  Undoubtedly, we need to do more to increase these rates and encourage a wider take-up of the NCS.  Deputy Whitmore and I have discussed this issue in a wider context and the Government has committed to do that.  It is important that we do not put out the message that there is a complete gap between the end of paid maternity leave and eligibility for the fully subsidised ECCE scheme.  The new scheme has been in place for only two years.  We have a lot more to do to improve it but it is there and I am committed to working further on it.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the rates of payment provided.  Parent's benefit is paid at the rate of &euro;245 per week, which is the same rate that applies for maternity and paternity leave.  If any change were made to parent's benefit, we would have to look at its impact on the other types of leave.  A total of 13,000 claims for parent's leave were made in the first 12 months of its introduction.  In January this year, there were just short of 2,500 claims, which represents a significant increase in uptake.  The leave is being availed of by parents and by better publicising its existence and how it can be applied for, we will continue to grow the numbers benefiting from it.  I am always happy at budget time to speak with the Ministers for Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform about how we can best target our resources to have the most impact, whether by raising rates or providing additional weeks of leave.<\/p>  <p>  I absolutely take Deputy Kerrane's point about the much greater risk for children raised in one-parent families of experiencing poverty.  There is statistical backup for that claim.  Our hands are tied in this particular legislation because we are transposing an EU directive and that directive is entirely clear about the non-transferability of the paid leave.  That is set out in Article 5.2 of the directive.  The nine weeks that we will eventually provide under the Bill is non-transferable.  To create a system whereby it could be transferred would, to my understanding, breach our requirements under the directive.<\/p>  <p>  I made the point yesterday that the range of people who can claim the leave is much wider than the biological parents of the child.  As well as parents, it includes civil partners, new spouses in the case of relationship breakdown and co-habitees of a parent.  There is a wide range of potential persons who can claim this particular benefit, in recognition of the wide variety of family situations that exist in society.  The directive, however, is very clear that this is leave for parents.  I take the point the Deputies made in this regard but that is the clear thrust of the directive.<\/p> <p>Just reading through its recital, the directive is very much cognisant of the fact that for too long, when leave was transferable, in the vast majority of cases the father's leave was transferred to the mother and traditional assumptions about care were reinforced.  That is what this directive is trying to get away from.  This directive has increased the amount of non-transferable time.  In the original directive, four weeks were non-transferable but that has been raised to nine weeks in this.  It was not felt enough was taking place to breach the traditional approach to caring responsibilities.<\/p> <p> I have been very clear I am aware we as a country must do more to support one-parent families.  We have provisions within the programme for Government to continue the rolling out of the proposals outlined in the Oireachtas joint committee on social protection report on lone parents from 2017.  We had a measure from this year's budget that will start in April this year for a one-parent family allowance.  There are a range of other measures in the programme for Government with which we are committed to addressing this matter.<\/p> <p> Focusing on this one measure as potentially addressing a much wider range of barriers faced by one-parent families is not realistic.  In particular, any changes made that would probably be in breach of EU law would only apply to one-parent families from now on and would not address the needs of existing one-parent families.  If we are putting in additional resources, we must target all one-parent families.<\/p> <p> I take on board the direction of the Deputies' amendments.  We must implement the terms of the directive by June next year and much of the work the Deputies are asking us to report on in the context of the amendments must be done anyway.  Not only will we report on it but many elements must be addressed either through primary or secondary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500041#RR00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616689200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will be pressing my amendment.  I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister in what he outlines but it is not in any way fair to suggest the child of a one-parent family will not be able to avail of the same time at home with a parent but this could be open to spouses or family members when this would not be the case.  In many cases the parent in a one-parent family parents the child alone and is isolated.  I cannot go back to them while saying I facilitated passage of this Bill because the Minister reassured me a spouse or other family member may emerge in future.  It is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment seeks to examine ways in which this provision could be extended to one-parent families over the next six months.  I understand the provisions of the directive the Minister refers to but there is clearly a lacuna in the law and we can be champions in pushing the discussion at an EU level, if necessary, or coming forward with legislation of our own that can address this question.  This omission is unfair and would enshrine inequality in the legislation.  We can do more to challenge or even enhance the directive at an EU level.  All I am asking for is a process of examination over six months and it is not good enough to say we are simply not going to do that.

As part of the Opposition we are very limited in the amendments we can propose.  We cannot, for example, make suggestions that place a charge on the Exchequer.  This amendment relates only to the monitoring and assessment of legislation and policies being implemented.  I have developed policies for the Australian Government and I know it is really important when developing policies and legislation to have a feedback loop built in.  We need to know what we do achieves the stated aims and that the process can be improved.  We should be constantly looking to improve the measures being put in place.<\/p>  <p>  All this amendment seeks is for the Minister to carry out a review that could have been quite simple and that would consider, assess and examine aspects of this process.  I can understand the Minister worrying about limitations about transferability with respect to the EU directive, and this may affect the ability to deal with one-parent families.  However, he should be examining ways in which paid parental leave can be extended to one-parent families.  It should be high on his agenda.  It is only one element and there are many other elements the Government should examine to support one-parent families.  This is a key element, nonetheless, and the Minister should consider how to provide this leave to one-parent families.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should also be looking at how to increase rates of pay and encourage the take-up of schemes.  What is contained in the amendment are actions the Minister should be taking as a standard.  This is a no-brainer.  I am thankful he said he would look at communicating better on the different types of leave available but he should be looking at how to streamline them.  This Bill started out as a parental leave Bill but it is now a family leave Bill.  There is confusion about what each of these elements mean.<\/p>  <p>  I wondered if we should ask how much time was set aside for each of these types of leave and the conditions required for maternity, paternity or parental leave or parental benefit and if Members would get the answers right if they were asked in the Chamber today.  We need to look at streamlining.  I understand some of them are very targeted but there should be a simple system for families to follow.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister indicated that the EU requires the Government to have the additional four-week period introduced by 2024.  Therefore, the period will extend to seven weeks by June of next year and the EU has stated we must have everything in place under the directive by 2024.  We are so far behind other EU countries in this regard and we must take a leadership role.  We should not be doing the absolute minimum required of us by the EU.  We should not say we will not bring in the remainder of this leave until 2024 because that is what the EU requires us to do.  We should look at our families and children within our communities to see what supports they need.  We know that is the right action to take, instead of following the EU instruction of having this in place by 2024.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to take a more proactive approach.  I am glad the EU has included a time limit as, unfortunately, we have seen over decades in the country that with our most progressive policies and legislation, the EU banging on our door makes us get it done.  I ask the Minister to be more proactive and get to the nine-week period before 2024.  He should give the families the support they need.  This provision for an additional three weeks is positive and a significant move, but that is because our bar is so low and we have done so little for families in this country when it comes to parental leave.  I ask the Minister to do more than what is expected.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment is simple and it is something a Government or policymaker should be doing anyway.

This extension is to recognise the difficulties new parents have had during the Covid crisis and the lack of traditional supports, be they immediate family supports or the wider societal supports that families normally seek to avail of.  We have demonstrated a proactive approach in terms of the amount we have granted this year and the context in which we are granting it.  There are other positive steps we are taking in this Bill on adoptive leave, such as removing a discrimination against male same-sex married couples and removing the presumption that adoptive leave would be taken by the mother in an opposite-sex couple who adopt.  This Bill demonstrates both a proactive and a progressive approach.<\/p>  <p>  I have outlined that we are undertaking the type of work and consideration set out in both of these amendments, whether in terms of rates or in terms of when we bring in the next increases.  However, I cannot make budgetary commitments today.  They are part of a cycle.  It is a significant amount of money.  It will cost &euro;28.6 million in 2021.  That will be money well spent as it is a good investment, but significant sums like that have to be planned and negotiated in the context of wider budgetary allocations.  We are looking at work in terms of the wider transposition of the directive over the next year and in terms of the legitimate points that have been made on support for one-parent families.  I have met with advocacy groups for one-parent families and we discussed this.  We discussed other issues as well.  There is an issue around the national childcare scheme.  Deputy Whitmore and I have talked about the impact of that scheme on certain communities and I am committed to looking at that in the short term to see what immediate interventions we can make to lessen discrimination there and in the medium to long term in terms of the new funding model we are looking at and hopefully will be introducing soon.  I have engaged with the Minister for Social Protection on the review of the payment of maintenance.  That is a discrete issue but it has been highlighted to me as often having a particular effect on one-parent families.  There are a range of issues, some in my Department's remit and some across wider Government, and we will continue to advocate on them.

It is an acknowledgement of the inability to access those familial, as well as wider societal, supports that have not been available or accessible because of closures, restrictions or not being able to travel.<\/p>  <p>  The core reasoning behind parental leave is to allow each parent to spend more time with the child in that crucial early period after birth.  That is why when the leave was first introduced, it was designated to be taken within that first year period.  It was to provide an enhancement for mothers beyond maternity leave and for fathers beyond paternity leave.<\/p>  <p>  We are extending that out to two years.  It broadens it out but it is not quite as tight.  It still recognises those essential two years.  The core reasoning behind this is to take account of what has happened over the past year.  It is our stance that taking it out to three years takes us well beyond that early year period and well beyond what the core of the directive is trying to achieve, namely, to ensure mothers and fathers have time to bond with their children, particularly in those crucial early weeks and months.  It is the absence of that time to bond which has led to the change in the directive from a previous version where the transferability of leave had been reduced and less leave could be transferred from the mother to the father.  That was discussed earlier.  Not enough fathers were taking up this particular leave.<\/p>  <p>  The secondary goal behind this particular leave is to promote and facilitate the reintegration of mothers into the labour market after they have taken up their period of maternity leave.  That is set out clearly in recital 20 of the directive.  To bring this out to three years would move us further away from that crunch point following the end of maternity leave.<\/p>  <p>  We have leave provisions that stretch out longer such as parental leave.  I accept that is an unpaid form of leave but it stretches out for a much wider period to provide flexibility for both parents.<\/p>  <p>  With this measure, we are providing a paid support for parents to be in a position to bond with and support their child in the initial period after birth.  We have taken the decision to elongate that to two years.  That is very much on the basis of what has happened this year and an acknowledgement of that.  It is our sense that two years is the ideal number in this particular circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500044#VV01300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1616690400,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I acknowledge this is an extension of the <i>status quo<\/i>as such.

It is different from dealing with it through a statutory instrument.  We are making a significant change to the time period within which parental leave can be taken.  We are doubling the period.  Doing so does deviate us slightly from the core of what this legislation is trying to do, which is to give parents time in those early weeks and months following the birth of the child.  However, there is a very strong reason for that because of Covid and we are recognising the difficulties new parents have had in that context.  If we were to take it to the three-year point it would take the Bill a long way from supporting parents in those early months and years.

Insurance fraud costs each and every one of us in this country.  Someone making a fake injury claim believes there are no consequences but there are significant consequences for each and every one of us.  The difficulty is that there is no downside for the individuals involved in making fraudulent claims.  We hear regularly that fraudulent claims are thrown out of court but there is no follow-up or no penalties imposed on the individuals involved in taking those claims in the first place.  There is no cost or consequence as a result of this practice.  The majority of claimants who take cases in the courts do so in good faith.  However, a small minority are making fraudulent claims in the hope of gaining large awards of tens or hundreds of thousands of euro and, as I said, without any risk to themselves.<\/p>  <p>  We all accept that there is no single measure which can tackle insurance costs in this country, but fraudulent and exaggerated claims have an impact on the increasing cost of insurance.  Every week, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives reports of fraudulent insurance claims.  There is a perception that fraud and exaggerated claims have been increasing in recent years without any consequence or risk to the claimants submitting them to the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill before us is to increase the penalties for those found guilty of an offence under section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which deals with fraudulent actions.  Our Bill is based on amending legislation that was in the past brought forward by the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and by former Deputy Billy Kelleher.  However, we have added to the draft of the legislation that was brought forward previously by colleagues.  The Bill states that where a person's case has been dismissed pursuant to section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, the plaintiff must pay the legal expenses of the defendant.  The Bill goes on to state that in the event of a case being struck out because of fraudulent evidence, the court will be allowed to direct that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for investigation.  However, it leaves the discretion with the judge in that instance.  The Bill also increases the fines that the District Court can hand down under the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 from the current &euro;3,000 up to the maximum permitted class A fine, which currently stands at &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation would bring this very innovative and unique provision into Irish law to provide discretion to a judge to refer a case to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We believe it is imperative that such a provision is set out in law.  We hope the Government will support the principle behind the Bill and allow it to progress to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500048#ZZ00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1616692500,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank my fellow members of the Regional Group for their hard work in bringing this Private Members' Bill to the House.  The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the penalties for those found guilty of an offence under section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which deals with fraudulent actions.  The aim of the Bill is to act as a genuine deterrent to those people who make false claims and, in turn, increase the penalties for such offences, and to have such matters referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for investigation at the court's discretion.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone will agree that insurance payouts in this country are too high.  If we look at payouts in other EU countries, as well as the UK, we can see clearly that insurance payouts are much greater in Ireland.  There are a number of reasons for this, including high legal costs, but also the number of fraudulent claims being made.  At present, there is no obvious deterrent for someone making a fraudulent claim.  That needs to change.  This is exactly what our group is looking to achieve with this Private Members' Bill.  We must, once and for all, have a real deterrent in place to stop this fraudulent behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen at first hand the devastating effects false insurance claims can have on small businesses, and I have spoken to many victims in my own constituency of Louth who have been subject to this.  The sad thing is there are simply no consequences for making such claims, which is simply wrong.  Before I came into the D&aacute;il, I had my own business.  Insurance was always one of the most costly expenses and it became more expensive each year.  The bottom line is that it is business which suffers.<\/p>  <p>  Defending cases of this nature in court is extremely costly, with the end result being that insurance premiums go through the roof.  In addition, many business owners feel that insurance companies settle dubious claims too quickly and easily.  This needs to be locked at and the insurance industry must be open to scrutiny in this regard.  Why are some claims challenged and others not?  It should be noted that it is only a very small minority who take part in this fraudulent behaviour but it is the majority who end up paying for it.  People think that insurance companies are out of pocket with these claims but the simple truth is that they just increase the premiums for everyone else in order to recoup the money they pay out on claims.  It can be seen clearly that we are all paying the price.<\/p>  <p>  I hope Members on all sides will support the Bill.  It is badly needed and must be supported.<\/p> <p>The Regional Group is very clear that it wants to work with the Government and all Members of the House to bring an end to this fraudulent behaviour.  Party politics simply do not come into it because as a society, we are paying a hefty price for insurance fraud and it must stop.  We accept that there is no simple solution but do not accept that there is no way to tackle the problem.  The bottom line is that fraudulent claims result in extraordinary payouts, which result in increased premiums that affect us all.  As my colleagues have said, we need a range of measures to tackle insurance fraud and this Bill is just one such measure.  It targets the minority of clients who bring fraudulent claims to court in the hope of receiving significant awards.  It will deter individuals from making such claims.  There must be repercussions for those who believe it is acceptable to submit fraudulent claims for damages.  <\/p> <p> On behalf of the Regional Group, I ask Members on all sides of the House to support this Bill so that we can begin the process of eliminating the scourge of false insurance claims in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500048#ZZ00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616693100,"counter":375,"content":"<p>This Bill is long overdue.  For far too long, a minority of people have brought false and fabricated insurance claims before the courts, in the same way as others might place a bet.  They have gambled and taken a chance because they knew they had little to lose except perhaps the cost of their own legal representation, assuming they were not using a no-win, no-fee solicitor.  Insurance fraud is prevalent across Ireland.  It is so common that many do not see it as an offence.  As it stands, there is no penalty or deterrent for abusing the system and making a false claim.  Too many people see our insurance industry as a soft touch and some are prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to exploit a porous system.  That mindset has clogged our court system with fraudulent and exaggerated insurance cases and resulted in people walking away with large sums of money for minor incidents.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance fraud happens right across society, from the deliberate staging of a physical accident to those who try to claim double the value of an insured item.  Some people feel that they have paid insurance premiums for many years and it is time they got some of that money back.  There is a mistaken belief that the insurance companies can afford to pay out on claims without impacting premiums.  People imagine that the insurance industry charges high premiums so that it has the money to pay out claims but this thought process must change.  People must realise, for the first time, that not only do exaggerated insurance claims not pay but that by making such a false claim, they will pay a price.  That price will act as a sufficient deterrent to them and others and eliminate the scourge of insurance abuse.  Significant costs are incurred by individuals and business owners in defending such cases in court.  Businesses have faced soaring insurance premiums as a result of the actions of fraudsters.  Many business owners are of the view that insurers settle dubious claims too easily.<\/p>  <p>  There are two main types of concocted insurance claims, the staged claim and the opportunistic one.  Staged claims are more common than people realise.  We regularly read about so-called crash for cash cases whereby people stage a car accident with another driver known to them or an innocent motorist.  They invent the circumstances of the crash, exaggerate their injuries and often attend hospital complaining of random neck and back injuries.  They claim medical benefits, hire a legal representative and head to court.  In some cases, rather than engage in lengthy and costly legal proceedings, insurers settle cases outside court and the claimant walks away with a tidy sum.  An opportunistic claim is different.  Generally an incident of some kind occurs and the injured party has a genuine claim to make.  However, the claimant chooses to overstate the claim to increase its value or overstate the damage to an item to get maximum value.  The prospects for making opportunistic claims are as endless as the numbers engaging in such activity.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment will act as a deterrent to those who consider making a fraudulent claim at either end of the scale.  It will make the opportunistic claimant think twice and will make the staged claimant realise that his or her activities are not a pathway to easy money and that the penalties are real and far-reaching.  This amendment is long overdue.  Had there been a deterrent in place before now, millions of euro could have been saved by insurers which would benefit all of us through a reduction in insurance premiums.  This Bill is only one of many measures required to end the culture of insurance manipulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500049#AAA00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1616693100,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak in favour of the Regional Group's Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2021.  So far in this D&aacute;il, my colleagues and I in the group have chosen to prioritise reform of the insurance industry.  Outside of Covid-19, insurance dysfunction has cost so many people so much, including families, homeowners, drivers and many small business owners.  This dsyfunction did not happen by accident.  It is the result of a closed market where there is little or no competition.  We see profiteering, gouging and the very opposite of decent business practices that should incentivise customer loyalty.  The insurance sector has been protected by years of Government inaction.  Many Governments have dragged their feet when called to reform the industry and the dysfunction has wreaked massive damage throughout society.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that businesses are being wiped out.  I have been talking to people in my constituency about insurance premiums.  In one case, insurance costs went up from &euro;2,000 to &euro;15,000 in the space of a couple of years while in another case, the cost rose from &euro;50,000 to &euro;130,000.  For most businesses, margins do not allow for that level of cost increase, that is assuming they can get insurance in the first place.  Drivers have been gouged.  Under the current system, the more loyal the customer, the more of a fool he or she is.  The pricing model acts as a tax on older people who do not have the ability to shop around.  Children's sports groups, Irish dancing classes and festivals around the country have contacted my office about their inability to procure insurance.  If they cannot procure insurance, they will be wiped out.<\/p>  <p>  Two investigations into this dysfunctional market are under way.  An investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has found that five insurance companies, an insurance industry trade association and an insurance broker allegedly engaged in anti-competitive co-operation.  A parallel investigation into the insurance industry is being undertaken by the European Commission.  There were dawn raids on the offices of insurance companies in 2017.  One literally could not write this. <\/p>  <p>  This Bill, one of several being worked on by the Regional Group, seeks to reform the sector and protect the consumer.  My political party, Aont&uacute;, has been working with the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  We have organised public meetings, including in County Meath, in an effort to raise the profile of this critical issue.  The purpose of this Bill is to increase penalties for those found guilty of an offence under section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act of 2004 which deals with fraudulent actions.  People should not be able to bring fraudulent claims to court and if they do so, they should not get off scot-free.  There must be a cost to fraud.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier in this D&aacute;il term, the Regional Group tabled a Private Members' motion on perjury in court.  I urge the Government to go further on this and to create a Garda insurance fraud unit.  We need to redefine and rebalance the common duty of care to require the occupier to have duty that is reasonable, practical and proportionate.  We need to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, ban dual pricing and make the insurance industry more competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500049#AAA00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1616693100,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Insurance reform is a buzzword which has been thrown around quite a lot in recent years.  I have certainly heard plenty about it in my 13 months in he D&aacute;il.  There has been no shortage of talk about insurance reform but a major shortage of action.  I welcome the fact that the Regional Group has the opportunity today to take action.  We must take these issues by the scruff of the neck and make the necessary changes.  The aim of the amendment Bill presented today by the Regional Group is to act as a deterrent to those making false claims by increasing the penalties for such offences, imposing legal costs on the plaintiff and having such matters referred to the DPP for investigation at the court's discretion.<\/p><p>Back in February, Wexford man Liam Griffin was interviewed in the <i>Irish Independent.  <\/i>Mr. Griffin is a successful businessman and hotelier whose Ferrycarrig Hotel and Monart Spa are popular destinations in County Wexford.<\/p> <p>In that article he said he believes the high cost of insurance is turning people off doing business, and even compromises community spirit.  We constantly hear warnings about the childcare sector and the rising costs of insurance that force closures.  There are big price rises for parents.  Providers are leaving the industry.  With regard to Covid, we are 192 days into a lockdown where a massive number of businesses have been forced to close, but the premiums are still rising.  The whole insurance issue is currently causing major headaches for business people.<\/p> <p> With all these points in mind, the need for colleagues to support our amendment Bill should be obvious.  People who make fraudulent claims contribute to all the problems I have just discussed.  In order to help solve those problems, we must ensure that attempted insurance fraud is met with a very strong deterrent.  Having the provision for attempted insurance fraud cases to be referred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is, quite simply, a no-brainer.  Fraud is a crime and suspected fraudsters should be investigated by the DPP.  I hope to see unanimous support for this stance.  If we have strong deterrents against people chancing their luck with a fraudulent claim then we can help contribute towards an overall reduction in undeserved pay outs and, hopefully, towards a reduction in premiums for people.<\/p> <p> I am disheartened and disappointed by the reaction of representative bodies in the insurance industry to the new Judicial Council's reductions in personal injury rates.  I believe there may be a certain amount of heel dragging when it comes to insurance companies reducing premiums.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has stated that delays in the reduction of costs will not be tolerated.  This sounds promising from the Government but the Minister of State needs to ensure that he follows through.<\/p> <p> There are other issues in the area of insurance that also need reform.  For community, voluntary or sporting groups, and even for public amenities, a situation has developed where we have struck an insurance fear into the hearts of people trying to run events.  Even if an organisation wants to run something as harmless as a field day, it feels the need to have an insurance policy in case the wrong person twists an ankle and looks to claim.  We need to tackle frivolous claims and ensure that we do not continue to deter volunteerism and community activities or end up with the closure of amenities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500049#AAA00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616693700,"counter":379,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, I thank Deputy Naughten for introducing the Bill on behalf of the Regional Group of Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance reform is a key priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the programme for Government, in the Government's action plan for insurance reform, which was launched last December, and in the Justice Plan 2021, which the Minister, Deputy McEntee, published recently.<\/p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that the objective of the Bill is to deal with the issue of fraudulent actions, and particularly as it arises in cases which may come to be dismissed under the specific terms of section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  I wish to state that the Government has decided not to oppose the Bill at this Stage but notes that substantial amendments will be required to it.  The Government also notes that it has already committed in its action plan on insurance reform to review the issues raised by the Bill, and work is under way in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's action plan for insurance reform sets out 66 actions designed to: bring down costs for consumers and businesses; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud; and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations.  The action plan includes actions to be taken by a number of Departments and implementation of the plan is being overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment&rsquo;s sub-group.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that there is a challenge with awards and claims inflation in the insurance sector, along with the premium inflation that comes from them.  At the same time, certain areas of risk are being avoided, in the commercial sense, across the sector and this is disadvantageous to both vulnerable business and other types consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Orders for costs are a major issue.  Section 2(a) of the Bill addresses amendments to section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  Section 26 of the 2004 Act provides that a court shall dismiss a plaintiff's personal injuries action in circumstances where the plaintiff or another person knowingly engages in the giving of false or misleading evidence unless the dismissal of the action would result in an injustice being done.  This amendment would require the court, where it so dismisses an action, to also make an order that the plaintiff shall pay the legal costs of the defendant, unless this would result in an injustice being done.  As Deputies will be aware, however, section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 deals with the issue of case dismissal on the basis of false or misleading evidence given in a personal injuries action.  It does this both in regard to the relevant proceedings and to any affidavit sworn in support of those proceedings under section 14 of the Act.  The section provides that the court shall dismiss an action in such circumstances \"unless, for reasons that the court shall state in its decision, the dismissal of the action would result in injustice being done\".<\/p>  <p>  When considering section 26 of the 2004 Act, it should also be noted that it needs to be read in conjunction with section 25 of the same Act.  Section 25 already makes it an offence to give or adduce false or misleading evidence in personal injuries cases.  It also makes it an offence to give, or dishonestly cause to be given, an instruction or information to a solicitor or a person acting on behalf of a solicitor or an expert in regard to a personal injuries action.  For the purposes of section 25, the act is done dishonestly if the person does it with the intention of misleading the court.  It is clear, therefore, that the avoidance of an injustice already runs to the root of section 26 as it currently stands and is implemented and, to that degree, it is already aligned with the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The view taken by the Government is that the Bill is, to some degree, a restatement of what is already happening in relation to costs before the court in personal injuries cases.  The Bill would impose a requirement on the courts to make orders for costs, despite this being a matter for which there is some existing judicial discretion and existing legislative basis.  I remind the House that under the long-standing principle that costs follow the event, the courts already have the power to award costs and have done so against a plaintiff at the discretion of the judge in many cases.<\/p>  <p>  A further important consideration is that Part 11, sections 168 and 169, of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 was commenced in October 2019.  Under section 168 of the 2015 Act a court now has the power to order that a party to a proceedings pay the costs of, or incidental to, the proceedings of one or more other parties to the proceedings.  The order may relate to, for example, part of the costs, costs incurred between specific dates, costs incurred for particular parts or steps in the proceedings, and costs relating to successful elements of the proceedings.  Section 169 of the 2015 Act gives effect to the principle of costs following the event.  It states that a party who is entirely successful in civil proceedings is entitled to an award of costs against a party who is not successful in those proceedings, unless the court orders otherwise, having regard to the particular nature and circumstances of the case, and the conduct of the proceedings by the parties.  The effect of the commencement of Part 11 is that the principle that costs follow the event was strengthened significantly and given legislative authority.  I believe that, as currently drafted, section 2(a) of this Bill runs the risk of impinging on existing legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2(b) of the proposed amendment makes provision for the courts at their discretion to refer cases that have been dismissed under section 26 or the Civility Liability and Courts Act to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  While it has been the case that judges on occasion have ordered matters to be brought to the attention of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the DPP would generally refer any alleged criminal matters onwards for the consideration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should be noted that the DPP does not have investigative powers or the power to direct An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do so.  Accordingly, where there is a question of whether there should be an investigation into the commission of a criminal offence, in this case of alleged insurance fraud, it is considered that it should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  Another fundamental consideration is that of differing standards of proof.  Where a case is dismissed under the terms of section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, this is a matter on which the court has been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that false or misleading evidence was intentionally provided.  It would be for another court to decide in the context of a criminal trial whether it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that an offence was committed under section 25 or any other relevant provision.<\/p> <p> Section 3 of the Bill proposes an amendment to section 29 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which deals with offences under Part 2 of the Act.  The amendment has the effect of increasing the maximum fine for an offence under the Act from its current level of &euro;3,000 to a class A fine currently set at &euro;5,000.  <\/p> <p> It should be noted that what is proposed in this Bill contrasts somewhat with the provisions of the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which was adopted as a Government Bill on 19 November 2019.  That Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, expects the Bill to be enacted later this year.  The Bill will provide clear direction to the courts in respect of the necessary penalties to be applied regarding the nature of the offence being prosecuted.  The penalties in the Bill are in line with those in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 regarding false evidence and fraudulent claims.  The amendment to the 2004 Act proposed in this Bill could, if enacted, create a situation where a person could be liable to different levels of maximum penalty on summary conviction for the same offence.<\/p> <p> I should add that in addition to the prosecutions relating to insurance fraud which may be brought under the 2004 Act and under the Perjury and Related Offences Bill upon its enactment, the Government is committed to increasing co-ordination and co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry.  The Government has also indicated its intention to expand the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, which deals with fraud, and to ensure the relevant fraudulent claims are forwarded to the DPP.  In addition, insurance fraud data will be published to allow for detailed analysis in this area with a view to taking the appropriate actions to address any pertinent issues.  When the perjury Bill is enacted, it will be a very important measure in countering insurance fraud and the compensation culture and high cost of insurance it fuels.<\/p> <p> The legislation to give effect to the recently adopted personal injuries guidelines is currently making its way through the Oireachtas.  As shown even by the examples I have given in response to the Bill, these mutually reinforcing measures have a particular focus on the area of insurance fraud and, as such, are strongly intended to augment the original policy objectives of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.<\/p> <p> Along with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, who has responsibility for insurance issues, I am very conscious of the issues highlighted in this Bill.  However, we need to ensure that any legislation produced in this House is legally robust.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500050#BBB00200","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616694300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>The next group is the Regional Group whose speakers will have ten minutes.

That is not even to mention the impact of Brexit.  All of us have heard the stories from business owners whose insurance premiums have doubled, tripled and quadrupled in the space of a few years.  At least part of the reason for high insurance premiums are the so-called day trippers - people who are carving a career out of making false claims for personal injuries and getting away with it.  I have been contacted by several Galway business people operating in different fields for whom the cost and availability of insurance cover is literally a matter of life or death for the businesses they operate.  They support a campaign for an 80% reduction in damages awarded for minor, fully recovered injuries to bring them into line with international norms.  That is not part of this Bill but is something that should be addressed in the future.  I believe that reducing the amount of compensation in such cases would make it a less appealing process for people making bogus or exaggerated claims.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling incidents of fraudulent claims, as proposed in this Bill, will play a part in making insurance cover more affordable.  That could make all the difference in the world to businesses.  Some time ago, an insurance company told the Oireachtas finance committee that it believed 20% of its claims were fraudulent.  The company claimed to have caught approximately half of those.  One in five claims is an extraordinary level of fraud and it is obvious that those people are not put off by the current penalty structure in the event of them being caught.  We need to have serious consequences in place for insurance claim fraud that would make very public examples of those criminals and make others think twice about doing it in the future.  In my opinion, this Bill will do that.  First, the fraudsters would have to pay the court costs of the people they are trying to defraud as well as their own legal representation costs.  Second, a judge throwing out a case for personal injuries compensation because of fraudulent evidence would have the option to refer the matter to the DPP for possible prosecution.  Third, the fines those people would face on conviction would be increased to a more realistic level.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware there is a debate over the extent to which fraudulent claims have an impact on the cost of insurance cover.  If we can seriously tackle and reduce the number of bogus claims, the insurance companies can no longer use that as an excuse for charging exorbitant premiums.  This Bill will not entirely solve the problem of crippling insurance costs, but it is a step in the right direction and part of a range of measures that can be taken to tackle the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500051#CCC00300","speaker":"1576"},{"type":"speech","time":1616694300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>As a member of the Regional Group I am very happy to be in the House this evening to support this proposed amendment to the Civil Liability and Courts Act.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, for his work in the area during the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Many members of the public, and especially people in private industry, were shocked, in the past 12 months particularly, to hear insurance companies outline large-scale fraudulent personal injury claims, albeit without insurance companies making large-scale complaints to garda&iacute; to any great degree.  Instead, many insurance companies prefer to transfer the liability cost onto hard-pressed businesses and consumers who, as a result, pay some of the highest insurance premiums in Europe on property, public liability and employment liability insurance.<\/p>  <p>  It has long been known that the burden of proof for personal injury claims has been of a low order.  Many soft tissue injuries cannot be confirmed on medical scans.  Therefore, they are, to a degree, subject to what the claimant is putting forward.  The onward incapacity is rather subjective on the claimant also.  That makes for a very difficult environment in which claims can be estimated.<\/p>  <p>  In many cases, it is well described how insurance companies will settle a case only with the minimal amount of investigation rather than proceed to open court where compensation can vary widely and insurance companies will also face the legal claims and costs from the plaintiff's side.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite talk of reform of fraudulent injury claims for a number of years, the issue is still pervasive and, in many cases, downright brazen.  Topical in recent weeks was the sight of Pat McDonagh, of Supermac's, refusing to make video evidence of fraudulent trips and falls available to clients in advance of their court sittings.  His defence rightly argued that they would amend their claims on seeing whether he had video evidence or not.  Legal defences claiming advance sight of such video evidence that could undermine a claim is making a mockery of general data protection regulation, GDPR, rights.  It is also making a mockery of a fair and legal process.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond that, there is recent evidence of legal practices trawling through claimants of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and highlighting that post-traumatic stress disorder could be considered a follow-on consequence of a personal injury claim and could be argued in court, whereby the claimant would receive a higher level of payout and the security of their legal fees would be insured where such a case was discharged.  That practice should be discouraged.  <\/p>  <p>  The amendment Bill before the House this evening is not about prosecution but rather about prevention, although prosecution is part of the Bill.  It is designed to make both claimants and legal counsel consider heavily before embarking on a case for personal injury awards through the courts as opposed to through the PIAB.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance fraud is not a victimless crime.  I am sure the Minister has heard all the speakers before me speak about the effects it is having on business, particularly the SME sector in this country.  There is a need for enforcement of bogus insurance claims and I ask the Minister to engage with the Department of Justice regarding setting up new initiatives with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide oversight on tackling insurance fraud.  Businesses within the entertainment and childcare sectors and the leisure industry are really struggling now with insurance premiums, as are people paying motor insurance.  The time has come for the Government to take a strong strand.  We have been hearing about reform of the insurance sector for quite a number of years.<\/p> <p>We need reform within the legal sector to get these costs under control.  We are paying the highest costs in Europe for insurance premiums.  That makes us uncompetitive in economic advancement and when exporting.  It is an issue that has to be tackled as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister to give it his full attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500051#CCC00400","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616694900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>We will support this legislation.  We understand exactly what it is about and the good intentions around it to ensure that we do everything possible to mitigate against people who make bogus and fraudulent claims and try to defraud either insurance companies or indeed businesses that are doing their best to try to survive in the difficult climate that we are in.  We also believe that it needs to go to Committee Stage and that considerable work is needed.  I hope that the proposers of the legislation would not in any way feel slighted by that.  There is work to be done on it.  The issue of insurance, the insurance industry and its reform is one that we all take seriously in this House and we all want to see much more work done on it.  We were all disappointed in recent weeks when limits were put on payouts for minor injury claims, when we heard the insurance industry come out almost immediately and say that it will not really make any difference and that it will not really be reducing premiums because it has not gone far enough.<\/p>  <p>  One of the central tenets of what we need to look at here is that the insurance companies will always have reasons they need to keep premiums so high.  Normally the reasons are about fraudulent claims and about how so much fraud is happening.  Deputy Grealish mentioned some of them saying that up to 20% of claims were fraudulent.  When they were questioned about whether they reported these fraudulent claims, they had not reported any of them.  If they actually believed that the claims were fraudulent, why were they not reporting them?  The other issue that we need to look at, which they always put forward, is the high level of payouts that we have in Ireland.  There are high payouts for minor injuries but when one looks at the whole spectrum of payouts, there is little or no difference between them and other jurisdictions.  They are quite similar because at the higher end, payouts in many jurisdictions are much higher than they are here.  All of this needs to be balanced.<\/p>  <p>  One of the primary things that we need to look at, which this legislation deals with, is section 26, about fraudulent actions, of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  A case has to be dismissed on that ground for this to apply.  Less than 1% of the cases about insurance claims over the past years were dismissed on that ground.  It is seldom that an insurance company puts forward \"fraudulent claim\" as its defence.  In most cases, it simply puts forward the reality that it feels that the person putting forward the claim either has not suffered the full extent of the injury or that the injury has not been that bad.  It is seldom that a company tries to suggest that it is a complete fraud, because that is a dangerous route for companies to take.  Work needs to be done on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill states \"the court shall make an order that the plaintiff shall pay the legal costs of the defendant\".  In the vast majority of cases that go to court, legal costs follow the judgment.  If the judgment is against a particular party, the legal costs go against that party too.  That is the case in all cases regardless of whether they are insurance cases.  It reinforces something that already exists.  While it is perhaps the right thing to do and needs to be done, we need to be careful about that.  The court must be able to use a certain amount of discretion in these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Subsection 2B states that the court may make the order for costs at its discretion.  That is exactly as it happens at the moment.  Maybe that needs to be tightened up or we need to examine where that is going.  Regarding whether a file should be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, what we have here is a civil case being taken by an individual against another individual or a business which the individual claims that he or she has an injury as a consequence of.  In that civil case, if the judgment goes against him or her, the judge will, in many cases where he or she feels it would be fraudulent, suggest that the garda&iacute; investigate it.  Whether or not it would be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, it would certainly not happen prior to garda&iacute; investigating it and determining whether there is a criminal case for action to be taken.  Work needs to be done on all of that.  The part of the Bill which suggests that the fine should increase from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 may well be appropriate.  I would not have a problem in that respect where a case is fraudulent.  One has to understand, as I said at the outset, that a tiny minority of these cases are defended on the basis that they are fraudulent.  It is seldom that an insurance company defends them on that basis.  It is only when that happens that this legislation would come into play.  Work needs to done to make it more robust if that is what is needed.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about bogus and fraudulent claims.  The excuses being put forward by the insurance industry in this country for the exorbitant cost of premiums in cases which are, if not bogus, certainly exaggerated in many cases need to be borne in mind too.  The insurance industry is making a lot of money.  It is doing well in this country.  It continues to charge high premiums.  At the same time, it always has a reason for it, and the reason is never that it is making too much profit.  The reason is always fraud, and this, that and the other.  We need to mitigate against that.  Where there is genuine fraud, it needs to be dealt with.  There are also cases where people have had a genuine accident, they take a case and go to a solicitor.  The legal profession will of course encourage them, tell them that they have a case and to move forward with it.  They will go to a doctor and get reports and so on.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the vast majority of people, they will put their best case forward.  In most cases, I do not think it is unfair to say that most people will not underestimate how bad their injury is, but they will try to be truthful about it.  If the judgment goes against them and the judge says that he or she does not think the person is as bad as claimed, that could be considered a fraudulent case.  Should that person then have to pay the full costs of the insurance company after getting reports from doctors and so on?  There needs to be balance in this.  We all have insurance for a reason, whether it is car insurance, business insurance or any other sort, so that if we suffer a loss or injury, we will be compensated for it.  It is right and proper that people should have that and they should be compensated for it.  There is nothing wrong with people making claims when they are genuine and can be stood over.  That needs to be brought into this too.<\/p>  <p>  I have no issue in supporting this legislation going to Committee Stage, teasing out and perhaps improving it to a stage where it would do what it says on the tin, which is to mitigate against fraud and ensure that we put in place strong penalties for people who intentionally set out to defraud insurance companies or businesses.  At the same time, we have to have balance and not go down the route of believing everything that insurance companies put forward as their reasons to skin people.  That is exactly what they are doing with insurance premiums in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500052#DDD00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1616694900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten and his group for tabling this Bill.  As my colleague, Teachta Kenny, has outlined, we support this.  However, we believe that it would benefit from discussion on Committee Stage so that we can all work together to improve it.  One thing that we are all aware of in our constituency offices is the cost of insurance and its impact on our constituents.  There are issues, especially with regard to the high price of insurance.  That causes much distress.  I hope that Deputy Naughten and the members of his group would be amenable to working with us on Committee Stage to ensure that, where this Bill can be strengthened, we all work together to ensure that we can do that.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance is at the forefront of the mind of anyone who is old enough to have cause to pay for insurance, whether for their car, motorbike, business, house, boat or whatever else.  The cost of insurance has rightly been defined as having reached something of a crisis point, especially vehicle and business insurance.  While the issue has many layers and complexities, there are core issues which need to be addressed and can be done relatively simply.  This is the second Bill about insurance which has come before the House in the past weeks.  Like Teachta Pearse Doherty's Bill to ban dual pricing, this also targets a problem area, which is fraud.  There is doubtless fraud related to insurance claims.<\/p> <p>As an Teachta Kenny has pointed out, the level and extent to which people believe this happens depends on who one is talking to.  Some believe it is rife; others believe there is only a small element of it.  That is where this legislation would benefit from a full discussion on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> We know fraud exists.  That is why the establishment of a stand-alone insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate insurance fraud, if and when it occurs, is long overdue.  It is clear that various criminal activities in the insurance market are becoming more sophisticated.  As a result, Garda operations must become more sophisticated and be better resourced.  That is why Sin F&eacute;in is seeking the establishment of a stand-alone specialist Garda insurance fraud unit made up of detectives, Garda staff and financial investigators.  This unit would be initially funded with the reserves built up by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and supplemented with additional public resources, as required.  It would created a hostile environment for organised criminality engaged in fraud, including ghost brokers, and ensure insurance companies comply with section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 by reporting all suspected fraud.<\/p> <p> However, we must also pull the insurance industry up on its own behaviour.  As insurance companies have begun to charge more for insurance premiums, they have run a simultaneous public disinformation campaign on the level of fraudulent claims to justify these extortionate premiums.  Companies have repeatedly said that 20% of all claims are fraudulent and are causing premiums to rise.  However, under questioning at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, and Taoiseach by an Teachta Pearse Doherty in 2019, it was revealed that companies only report a fraction of claims to the Garda as fraudulent.  For example, Axa reported only 1% of claims to the Garda as fraudulent in 2018, not 20%.  For Aviva, it was 4% and for Allianz, this figure was as little as 1%.  Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 makes clear that it is an offence for companies to fail to report known crimes such as fraud.  Therefore, either the industry is exaggerating or there are persons involved who are in breach of the law.<\/p> <p> According to Insurance Ireland's own figures, the number of motor insurance claims from 2014 to 2017 went down by 22%, amounting to 55,000 fewer claims.  Despite this, the average motor insurance premium rose by 45% in the same period.  This is also in the context of total personal injury awards being paid out through the courts and Personal Injuries Assessment Board falling by 15% from 2014 to 2018.  It is crucial that Insurance Ireland speaks out on the fact insurance premiums have risen, despite the falling numbers and the falling cost of claims.  It is important we challenge all of the issues in the area of insurance.  Otherwise, we are letting the big players in the insurance industry off the hook completely.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, this is a multifaceted issue.  Indeed, we need to tackle the wrongdoing everywhere, from fraudsters, to companies using aggressive and anti-consumer pricing practices, customers facing artificially high prices, the industry overblowing levels of fraudulent claims, and criminal activities in the area such as the use of ghost brokers.  It all must be challenged.  People who commit fraud somehow think it is just the insurance company they are ripping off.  It is not; it is all of us in the insurance pool.<\/p> <p> As has been said here previously, this is not a victimless crime.  This sort of carry on destabilises the insurance pool, because if fraud results in increased insurance premiums, it means some people will no longer be able to afford the premiums and they have to leave the market.  As the numbers drop, the risk increases and therefore the price increases further.  Across the board, we know rising premiums have caused havoc for small businesses, such as restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and childcare to name but a few.  I know the live events sector is another area where insurance costs have put a lot of strain on events organisers and artists themselves.  While we all know the importance of insurance cover, it must be accessible for those who work in the area and need it to work.  There cannot be a continuation of the situation where insurance is an actual barrier to businesses operating or people being able to something as simple as drive.<\/p> <p> To do this, we must tackle the causes of excessive premiums and do all we can to ensure these premiums are affordable and accessible.  This legislation is an important part of that.  As I have said, we will be supporting its passage, and we hope Deputy Naughten and the members of his group will work with us to strengthen it on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500052#DDD00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616695500,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this Bill.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the penalties for those found guilty of an offence under section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which deals with fraudulent actions.  Section 26 states the plaintiff in a personal injuries action who gives evidence that is false or misleading in any material respect and knows it to be false or misleading shall have his or her action dismissed unless such dismissal would result in injustice being done.  The proposed amendment Bill states that where a person's case has been dismissed pursuant to section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, the plaintiff must pay the legal expenses of the defendant.  The Bill provides that the court can direct that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for investigation.  The Bill allows for judicial discretion, which I support.  The Bill also increases the fine the District Court can hand out under the original Act from the current &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000.  My colleague, an Teachta Kenny, has spoken on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  In an answer to a parliamentary question submitted by my colleague, an Teachta Doherty, in 2019, the then Minister for Justice and Equality stated that in the period 1 November 2018 to the end of May 2019, 50 incidents of insurance fraud were recorded, an average of seven cases per month.  Some spurious cases may have been encouraged by a no win-no fee arrangement with a solicitor.  There is a perception that fraud and exaggerated claims have been increasing in recent years with little or no consequence or risk to making such claims.  I understand some have no choice but to use the no win-no fee arrangement because they simply cannot afford anything else.  That does not mean all of those claims are fraudulent.<\/p>  <p>  Many insurance customers are of the view that this has significantly contributed to a culture where a small percentage of people may be encouraged to make fraudulent claims without any real consequences should they be unsuccessful.  Significant costs are incurred by business owners, in particular in defending their case in court.  Businesses have faced soaring insurance premiums as a result of the action of fraudulent claims .  Some business owners have told me their insurance companies are too quick to settle claims because it is sometimes more expensive to fight them.<\/p>  <p>  A minority of claimants bring fraudulent claims to court in the hope of receiving significant awards.  The aim of this Bill is to act as a deterrent to those making false claims by increasing penalties, including the possibility of the plaintiff having to pay the legal costs of the defendant and of the matter being referred to the DPP for investigation.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance fraud should not pay and this message is evident in this legislation.  Not only should it not pay, it should not be a burden on innocent insurance customers.  It has a cost for every one of us.  While there have been some recent cases of claims being thrown out of court, there has been little or no follow-up or penalties incurred as a result.  Without penalty or consequences, the practice will only continue.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is similar to one published by the now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when he was in opposition.  Unlike so many of the initiatives proposed by the Opposition in the term of this D&aacute;il to date, I hope the Government will not turn its back on measures each party has supported in the past.  I believe this Bill will act as a genuine deterrent to those making false claims, and I add my support to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500053#EEE00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1616695500,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill proposed by Deputy Naughten.  The Labour Party is happy to provide its support to enable the Bill to get to Committee Stage at least, where we can complete a more detailed analysis which is required.<\/p>  <p>  The explanatory memorandum of the Bill makes some very interesting points in respect of the purpose of the Bill.  I note that refers to \"a perception that fraud and exaggerated claims have been increasing in recent years\".  I note the careful language used.  The jury, as it were, is out on that particular claim.  The figures the industry has published on its view of fraudulent or exaggerated claims are very much open to question.<\/p>  <p>  The memorandum also states, \"Businesses have faced soaring insurance premium costs as a result of the actions of fraudsters.\"  It is at pains to point out that only a minority of claimants bring forward fraudulent claims to courts.<\/p> <p>The Bill seeks to ensure that an automatic referral of a claim that has been found to be fraudulent would be made to the DPP, which could act as a deterrent to would-be fraudsters.  This is a function that our courts already enjoy and an option that is available to judges sitting in adjudication on cases.  By all means, judges and the court system should avail of the opportunities provided to them to make sure that fraudulent or exaggerated claims are moved on to be investigated by the relevant agencies and that justice is done in this regard.  As other Deputies noted, fraud is not a victimless crime.  We all pay for it through higher premiums and the increase in the cost of doing business that arises when there are fraudulent claims.  Where fraud occurs, it should absolutely be rooted out and dealt with in a very severe and serious manner.<br\/><br\/>There is much that is wrong with the insurance industry.  In an effort to fix those wrongs, I am not sure that I would necessarily start from this juncture.  Experience and history show us that we must take everything the industry tells us with a liberal pinch of salt and not buy the line it is selling.  Claims made by representatives of the industry a couple of years ago at the finance committee that up to 20% of claims are false, fraudulent or exaggerated have not been substantiated to anyone's satisfaction.  A fact-checking exercise by <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>noted: &quot;There is a large discrepancy between the low number of reported cases of fraud and exaggeration to garda&iacute; and the estimated 20% figure stated [by the industry] in the instance of personal injury cases.&quot;  The movers of the Bill are in danger of producing legislation that is in search of a problem.  It would be letting the exceptionally profitable Irish insurance industry off the hook if we were to exaggerate the impact on premiums of what is, in the scheme of things, a small number of fraudulent claims.<br\/><br\/>Let us look at the facts around the cost of insurance in this country.  There is a massive problem with profiteering and cartel-like behaviour in the sector.  The accusation of anti-competitive practices and cartel-like behaviour is not my charge alone but what the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, described in its interim report, published last September, on its investigation into so-called price signalling in the motor insurance industry.  Over a 21-month period in 2015 and 2016, the commission suspects that some motor insurers were systematically ripping off punters by co-ordinating market activity.  That is code for operating a cartel-like system to stiff car owners.  It is important to look at the facts in this regard.  Between 2013 and 2018, motor insurance premiums rose by a massive 62%, on average, from &euro;435 to &euro;706.  At that time, the industry persistently cried foul and put the increase in premiums down to rising claims costs.  That is manifestly not true.  In fact, claims costs rose by a mere 14% in that period.  This issue needs to be addressed swiftly.<br\/><br\/>The Government and its predecessor have very dutifully done everything the industry has asked of them, but the industry has not reciprocated.  We now know a lot more than we did before about the dynamics going on under the bonnet of this industry.  The national claims information database, NCID, is operational.  It has reported on motor insurance and the industry has been caught with its hands in our pockets.  As far as I know, it has not yet reported on public liability and employers' liability insurance.  Legal fees are one of the major contributors to eye-watering legal costs in this country.  That needs attention.  The work of the Judicial Council and the revised personal injury awards regime should see movement in this regard and a reduction in costs for business and ordinary consumers as a result.<br\/><br\/>As I said, successive Governments have been very malleable in meeting the demands of the insurance industry.  It is right that awards for minor damages from which personal injury claimants almost always recover well should be drastically reduced.  We all want to see that.  We know that the small businesses that are in the firing line in this regard, including retailers, restaurants and caf&eacute;s, are getting absolutely hammered on the cost of claims in respect of soft tissue damage and so on.  That is a risk to businesses and jobs.  However, even after the Government and the Judicial Council attended to this matter, we are still waiting for the industry to drop its premiums.  The new regime can and will see claims costs go down at some point in time but it has not happened overnight.  I am interested to know the Government's perspective on when that might happen.  Insurance companies have yet to factor in the new regime and provide the reductions for consumers that the logic of the new system was supposed to deliver.  The industry is coming up with excuse after excuse not to refund a few euro to car owners whose vehicles have been parked in their driveways for most of the period since Christmas.  In a reply to me yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, stated that they plan to raise this issue with the insurance industry.<br\/><br\/>I have noted that there are a lot of things wrong with the way in which the insurance industry works in this country.  Fraud is a problem and I am at one with the movers of the Bill that it absolutely should be rooted out in a deadly serious fashion.  In doing so, however, we must not lose sight of the impact the actions of the industry itself is having on business and regular customers.  We need to have a sense of proportion when addressing this issue.  Our focus should be on the industry's cartel-like behaviour, price signalling, dual pricing, penalising of loyal customers on renewal, failure to refund hard-pressed customers at this unprecedented time and refusal to reduce premiums immediately in response to the new personal injuries regime.  We know why premiums are out of kilter with analogous markets.  It is not all down to the level of fraud that some claim goes on but which is unsubstantiated at this point in time.  There is a larger question that we, as a Legislature, need to address.  We know how it can be addressed but the insurance industry has been dragging its feet in this regard for far too long.  This Government and the previous one has done everything the industry has asked of them.  It is now time for the industry to act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500053#EEE00300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616696100,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  We all agree that affordable insurance is fundamental to the well-being and interests of the country.  The sky-high premiums that are being charged add significantly to the cost base of our economy and are a substantial financial burden for individual households.  We all know that insurance costs in this country are high by international standards.  Despite falls in the average costs of claims over the past ten years, premiums continue to rise.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, there is no argument against the fact that there are exaggerated claims and insurance fraud.  There is no doubt that fraud happens; it is to the question of the degree to which it happens that we need to apply our attention.  We must take greater steps to reduce fraud, such as the introduction of a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit to bring prosecutions against those who exaggerate or make outright false claims.  People who purposely mislead the courts should expect to face consequences.  We all pay a price for not ensuring that happens and it is short-sighted to fail to invest in enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  Fraudulent insurance claims are already criminalised under section 25 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  It is an offence under that Act to give false or misleading evidence in regard to personal injury actions.  The existing penalties are significant, involving a &euro;3,000 fine, imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both.  However, the number of prosecutions brought under this section has been minuscule.  Whether this is the result of a lack of cases or a lack of Garda resources to pursue such matters is not entirely clear and warrants further investigation.  This Bill would increase the financial penalty for fraudulent claims by raising the fine to &euro;5,000 plus the legal costs of the defendant.  However, if there are very few cases brought to the Garda and very few prosecutions, it is not obvious how increasing the penalty will make a significant difference.  There certainly is a discussion to be had on strengthening our laws in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In driving up penalties for such claims, we must be careful not to initiate a chilling effect on people who have legitimate claims.<\/p> <p>Not every legitimate case before the courts will have airtight evidence in its favour.  Insurance companies will contest legitimate cases as well.  If increasing the financial penalty for a small number of guilty individuals will make it more difficult for innocent people with a legitimate claim and where they are rightly due damages, we must be careful.<\/p> <p> The explanatory memorandum mentions the perception of fraud and exaggerated claims.  We must go beyond that as the official data on fraudulent and exaggerated claims are limited.  Data on insurance costs in general are thin on the ground and I have not found any data indicating significant increases in insurance fraud in recent years.  It is important to separate the facts on insurance fraud from the insurance industry's continuous narrative that there is an epidemic of insurance fraud responsible for driving up costs.  The argument that soaring premium costs can be attributed to criminal acts of a few individuals is a narrative that is quite definitely promoted by the industry for very good reasons.  We must be very careful.  There is no doubt there is a concern but we must ensure we get to the source of the problem.<\/p> <p> Insurance companies have put the rate of fraudulent and exaggerated claims at 20% but those figures are, of course, largely inflated.  Insurance companies report only approximately 1% of claims to garda&iacute; as fraudulent, so as the rates of fraud are exaggerated, it stands to reason that the effect on premiums is also exaggerated.  Mr. Justice Kevin Cross is the High Court judge currently in charge of the personal injuries list and he has shared his view, stating it is fundamentally dishonest to blame supposedly fraudulent claims for the cost of insurance.  In its 2017 report, the cost of insurance working group stated that fraud was not one of the main reasons for increasing motor insurance costs and a follow-up report noted there were no official data to indicate that insurance fraud was widespread.<\/p> <p> The reality is we are lacking official data on liability insurance, which makes it very difficult to pinpoint cases for high premiums and the areas in which we must strengthen legislation.  The data we have indicate that public liability insurance premiums have jumped by 15% to 20% over the past three years, as reported by the CCPC.  The sharp increase in cases and the exit of a number of overseas providers from the market has been devastating for so many community groups, sports clubs, childcare facilities, etc.  The CCPC report highlights the lack of independent public data on the insurance market as a barrier for new entrants to the market.  We must pay very serious attention to that.  Businesses and community groups must be supported by the State so they can engage with the market and lower risk profiles where possible.<\/p> <p> A recent Central Bank report on motor insurance claims indicates people were not benefitting from settling personal injury claims through litigation and they often ended up waiting twice as long for a settlement almost similar in size.  The report indicates the litigation costs accounted for approximately 67% of compensation awarded, bringing average claim costs to &euro;40,000.  In comparison, legal costs under the PIAB account for less than 4% of compensation awarded and the total for average claims is less than &euro;24,000, which is a difference of &euro;16,000 per claim.  There is also a significant difference in the time taken to settle a claim.  Claims involving litigation take an average of 4.7 years, whereas the PIAB took 2.9 years on average.  The benefits of the board's process are clear and there is great benefit to expanding the role of this board.  There are areas like mediation of settlements where this should happen.<\/p> <p> We must examine evidence and we need more data.  We are not opposed to this legislation but more information is needed.  Perhaps it does not get to the crux of what will resolve this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500054#FFF00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616696700,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I support this important legislation from the Regional Group, particularly Deputy Naughten, which is very badly needed.

They made people think.<\/p>  <p>  This is not by any manner or means a panacea for fixing the insurance industry.  As others have said, insurance is a lucrative business and because some firms have left our market, it is less competitive than it was.

We are given every reason in the book for these companies not dealing with the problem but instead getting as much as they can, in the main, from the people who pay for insurance.  I raised yesterday how the Judicial Council is trying to deal with overpayments for small and trivial injuries; it is only tinkering with this and it is not really serious about the matter.

They paid their insurance through the years but the insurance companies were not willing to pay when there was a genuine reason.  Sometimes it looks like people must pay the bill but there is no guarantee of getting back the money.  Community voluntary organisations are suffering severely.  Many claims should be disputed and fought in court but they are just settled.  A voluntary organisation I am involved with saw this happen some years ago when it was a disaster to pay money on the claim.  It was done almost automatically and the consent of the organisation was not sought.  We gave an instruction that the claim should be fought as we felt we were in the right.

There could be two or three different people coming into court every six months making claims and it is not being picked up on.  There has to be accountability for it.

Many businesses have been left high and dry and many have suffered much distress due to fraudulent compensation claims.  This Bill is relevant and appropriate to what is happening in Ireland.  As Deputy Naughten made clear, the Bill's aim is to act as a genuine deterrent to those making false claims by increasing penalties for such offences, imposing legal costs on the plaintiff and having such matters referred to the Director of Public Prosecutors for investigation at the court's discretion.  This is an excellent objective.  I am tempted to say we have enough gangsters in the insurance sector without having chancers in the courtrooms too.<\/p><p>The damage to small firms through insurance fraud is massive.  It can wipe out a business financially and destroy the businessperson who has spent many hard years building the business up.  Jonathan Hehir, CEO of <i>insuremyshop.ie<\/i>, said recently:<\/p> <blockquote> \tShops throughout [this] country [have closed] as a result of crippling fraudulent public liability claims and subsequent premium increases.  False claims [he went on to say] are a 'plague' on many small businesses in Ireland, particularly those in retail, where some people attempt to sue after pretending to trip in a shop, or pretending to steal so [that] they can [then] accuse the store for defamation when questioned.  From what [this group has seen] on the ground, a significant portion of these cases in some shops are intentionally planned by criminals [who] have invariably benefitted from similar exercises in the past. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is why this Bill is so important.

I support it as a member of a Government party and personally.  My then colleague, Billy Kelleher, now an MEP, introduced this Bill in the last D&aacute;il and I spoke in support of it on that occasion.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, introduced and took the baton forward on the Bill in the last D&aacute;il and I commend his work on it.<\/p><p>There can be no doubt that the consequences for those who perpetrate fraudulent claims should be grave.  Consequences should apply and the fact somebody can make an exaggerated or entirely bogus claim with no consequence is not acceptable.  We heard the Minister of State particularise the measures that are in place at the moment for dealing with such claims.<\/p><p>There are a couple of things that are useful to reflect on in the context of the Bill.  One is that in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 there are already provisions &ndash; I think in sections 25 and 26 &ndash; that provide for it to be an offence for somebody to mislead the court.  Every personal injury claim that is submitted to a court process requires an affidavit of verification where somebody has to swear on affidavit that they are telling the truth.  It is important to note there are existing protections and precautions within the system.  It is true, as the Minister of State referenced, that costs follow the event.  That means in a civil case that if one loses, one pays.  It is often said there is no consequence and people who lose do not pay.  Often the reason they do not pay is they do not have anything to pay with.  That is not an endorsement or excuse for somebody offering a fraudulent claim but it puts some context around the provisions.  There is already a provision and costs go against the losing party.  The question is how that is enforced.  Does a sheriff go after somebody and pursue them to their home, if they have one, and take the car, vehicle or whatever assets they may have?  Often they are people of little means.  There is that practical issue to consider.<\/p><p>I support the Bill and I commend and see exactly where the Deputies are coming from in introducing it. Everybody in this House and this country would be against fraudulent claims.  However, it is important to put some context on it.  There is a narrative that has emerged in recent years and has been, I suggest, largely driven by insurance companies that every claim is fraudulent and everybody who walks up the steps of the courts is on a mission to defraud the taxpayer, the insurance company or the small business.  That is not the case.  We have heard already from other Deputies that it is a very small minority of claims that fall into this category.<\/p><p>It is also important to reflect that the foundation in our law for this type of claim goes back to first principles.  These are important principles of employee protection, consumer protection and, in many cases, environmental protection.  A century ago, coming out of the industrial revolution it was seen as acceptable to have workers, often from children up, spend their entire lives working in grimy pits and factories.  They were in workplaces with no health and safety, no regulated breaks or working time and no protective measures.  If somebody fell dead on the production line, they were effectively swept off the floor and replaced quickly.  That might be an extreme case but there was no protection and no recourse if somebody was injured in a workplace accident or, indeed, if somebody brought a faulty product.  A famous case where the law was changed concerned a young schoolgirl in a nightdress which went on fire in front of a fireplace because it turned out to be made of flammable materials.<\/p><p>Another landmark case was Donoghue <i>v.<\/i>Stevenson, 1932, which anyone who studied law in the last 90 years will be familiar with.  It is often referred to as the tale of the snail in the ginger ale.  It is the foundation of the modern tort of negligence.  Effectively, that case was about a woman drinking a bottle of ginger ale and, to her horror, when she opened it, began to drink and had consumed half of it, she realised it was so putrid it had snails growing and living inside it.  Snails are disgusting things to find in one's ginger ale but one could get worse: carcinogenic substances, cancer-causing materials and all kinds of hazardous materials in a product one has ingested, consumed, bought or had put upon one.  It is reasonable to say one should be able to bring a claim in those circumstances and have right of recourse and redress.  The manufacturer of a profit is the big fish in this.  It is usually the small man or woman on the other end of these situations and they should have some right of reply and redress and be able to litigate that, if necessary, before the courts.  It is important to hold that context.  Many of the types of actions that go before the courts vindicate laws we make in this Chamber, that our predecessors made in the last decades or that have come from Europe.  They are there for good reasons: to protect individuals and to protect the rights of the small man or woman against big corporations, be they employers, manufacturers of products or other things.<\/p><p>That is the principle point I want to make.  Not everybody who brings a claim is bad, not everybody should be discouraged from bringing a claim and they are vindicating important rights that we and others have legislated for them to have.  Society has progressed by giving those rights.<\/p><p>The other point has been made by other Deputies but I completely concur.  It is that insurance companies would have us believe that every claim is fraudulent.  There is an extent to which the media play into that narrative because we often read in the papers about shock-horror cases where either the case was thrown out of court or some huge award was given in circumstances where it seems a bit dubious or undeserved.  We rarely read about the 99% of cases in between where people bring a legitimate cause of action, are rewarded an often modest sum and walk out of court no better off than they started.<\/p> <p>Perhaps, however, the wrong is righted by some small award to compensate for what may have been a significant loss.<\/p> <p> The insurance companies have major questions to answer.  The suggestion is that fraudulent claims are the root of all evil in terms of the premiums that both small and large businesses and, indeed, individuals and consumers or anybody who bought or tried to get a car on the road in recent years, particularly younger people, have experienced.  I know the blight of insurance premiums on businesses in my constituency.  To suggest, however, that all of this can be laid at the door of the fewer than 1% of claimants who make fraudulent claims is to asking too much and going too far.<\/p> <p> We in this House have done our bit, introducing successive items of legislation relating to this matter.  We are now introducing with legislation to copper-fasten existing legislation.  The Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 is being supplemented with very similar provisions in the perjury Bill, which is passing through the House at the moment.  The Bill with which we are dealing was brought before the House with absolutely good intent.  I completely support and endorse the reasoning behind its introduction.  It is, however, building on foundations that were laid 20 years ago in terms of recourse, penalties and sanctions.<\/p> <p> It is time for insurance companies to get real and get on with actually dealing with this matter.  I do not buy the argument that this is the cause of it all.  The bottom line is that the profits of those companies are far more to do with it and that is really where the examination stops.  This House and the political system in general have done their part.  It is over to the insurers to bring premiums down and to look at the books and the reasons involved.  It is important, however, that all of us in this House challenge the perceptions that exist in respect of fraudulent claims because, in my view, the companies involved are flogging a false narrative for their own commercial gain.  It is very important that we do this while recognising the right and the legitimacy of the ordinary man or woman to bring a claim where he or she has been wronged.  There is actually nothing untoward about that whatsoever in the vast majority of circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500056#HHH00300","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616697900,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawless.

I also thank those Members who have participated so far in the debate.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State outlined, there is much common ground between this Bill and the Government's action plan for insurance reform.  I acknowledge the various points that have been expressed by Deputies about the high cost of insurance in this jurisdiction and, most importantly, the adverse impact this has on our private citizens, enterprise and communities.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is taking insurance reform very seriously, as are all Members who spoke here tonight.  We know that a cost-competitive insurance sector is absolutely vital for our financial stability and economic activity.  We know too that pricing and availability of insurance has been and remains a major problem for businesses, community groups and consumers.  The programme for Government outlines a range of commitments to inform our insurance sector and the action plan for insurance reform, which was published in December, contains 66 specific actions aimed at bringing down costs for consumers and businesses including introducing more competition into the market, preventing fraud and reducing the burden on the business community and voluntary organisations.  Those actions include examination of the very issues which are the subject of this Bill this evening, that is, the pursuit of fraudulent claims and the awarding of costs,<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address these issues and, more generally, what is colloquially described as the claims culture that drives them.  Insurance reform is a key goal for the Department and is included in our Justice Plan 2021, which was published in February.  My Department is engaging in work in a number of areas to address these matters, including placing the offence of perjury on a statutory footing and making it easier to prosecute, examining and providing recommendations regarding changes to ensure insurance fraud data is published and enhancing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the range of legislative and policy measures to which the Minister of State referred, legislation has already taken effect to help address this complex situation.  The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018, for example, which commenced on 28 January 2019, establishes a national claims information database on a legislative basis to facilitate a more in-depth analysis of annual trends for motor insurance claims.  We are also examining the potential to bring forward proposals with regard to other areas of reform such as occupiers liability and the potential to cap awards.  This is in addition to the personal injury guidelines which Deputies have outlined.  These were recently adopted by the Judicial Council and legislation relating to them is currently going through this House.<\/p>  <p>  A key component of many of our reforms is the need to tackle insurance fraud.  This includes examining those areas which are central to the root of the Bill being considered here, that is, awarding of costs and referral of fraudulent actions.  As we have heard this evening, however, and as my colleague, the Minister of State, indicated, there are issues with the measures as outlined in the Bill which will require significant amendment.  Given the broad range of challenges being faced, amending section 26 of the 2004 Act will not solve all our problems on its own.  Indeed, there is no silver bullet when it comes to this complex problem.<\/p>  <p>  In its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, the cost of insurance working group expressed a belief that for section 26 to more effectively achieve its aim of tackling personal injury fraud, there was a major onus on defendants to challenge misleading evidence, where appropriate, by taking it to court rather than settling on the court steps for fear of an unsatisfactory outcome.  The working group was also of the view that appropriate use of the legislative provisions in the 2004 Act could be facilitated by encouraging the industry to make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where it believes fraud to have featured in particular claims.<\/p>  <p>  As previously stated, the Government is committed to increasing co-ordination and co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and insurance industry .  The action plan for insurance reform makes specific reference to an expansion of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, to deal with the issue of insurance fraud.  While reassignment of all Garda staff has been delayed due to Covid-19, it is expected that allocations of Garda staff to specialist units, including the GNECB, will commence towards the end of this month.  In addition to this, a competition has commenced to recruit three forensic accountants for GNECB, which doubles the current allocation of three.  I should also add that Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which provides for a statutory offence of perjury that can be clearly interpreted by investigators, prosecutors and the courts alike and includes false statements on oaths, false statutory declarations, fabrication of evidence and subordination of perjury is currently going through the Oireachtas.  I hope to have further progress on this in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also consolidates other relevant legislation in the area of perjury and knowingly making false statements in formal legal proceedings.  The Bill, when enacted, will provide a clear definition of perjury, and simply put, should enable the offence and related offences to be more easily prosecuted in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  These concerted reform initiatives represent a series of mutually reinforcing measures that in their collective implementation will strengthen sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act.  I reiterate that the Government is not opposing the Bill on Second Stage.  The Government view, however, which has been expressed this evening by my colleague, the Minister of State, is that substantial amendment will be required to the Bill before it proceeds further.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Naughten and all his colleagues for raising these issues and, most sincerely, the spirit in which that was done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500057#JJJ00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1616697900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank the Minster.

It is good that the Regional Independent Group has picked up the baton, so to speak, and introduced the strengthened legislation that is before the House this evening.<\/p>  <p>  I am heartened by the position the Government has adopted in that it will not oppose the Bill.  I am also encouraged that others in opposition have expressed support for it.  That is a very good thing.  Why would there not be cross-party support for this important legislation?  Everybody in the House appreciates and accepts that the insurance crisis in this country is a cross-cutting issue that affects every facet of society.  It impacts on our schools, cr&egrave;ches, public amenities, small businesses and friends and families everywhere.<\/p>  <p>  I also totally accept that a multitude of factors are at play and that one single measure will not address the entirety of the problem.  There is an issue, however, where a small minority of claimants submit spurious, exaggerated and bogus claims.  If that issue were tackled, it would have a disproportionately positive affect downstream.  It is something we should certainly go after.<\/p>  <p>  I am very much in favour of this Bill for four reasons.  The first is that the emphasis here is on deterrent, not punishment or retribution.  Everybody understands that insurance is there for a reason.  It is there for genuine people who have been genuinely injured.  They should not be out of pocket.  They should have their medical bills paid for and receive adequate compensation for their injuries.  I believe everybody accepts that.  It is also important, however, that the threshold of penalties is raised slightly in order that we absolutely discourage and deter spurious and bogus claims.<\/p> <p>What is suggested in the Bill makes much sense.  If a claim is thrown out of court because it is deemed to be fraudulent, then it is reasonable to expect that the claimant pays the defendant's legal fees.  While the implementation is a little more complex, at least the principle is sound.  The Bill proposes that a defined pathway will exist and that judges, should they choose to exercise this right, could refer fraudulent claims to the Director of Public Prosecutions for further consideration, if, again, it is deemed appropriate.<\/p> <p> This legislation is appropriate and justified.  More important, while it is a little bit delayed, it is proportionate and needed in this day and age.  Another reason I support it is that it will free up a lot of court time.  Much court time is wasted with unnecessary cases and claims.  If we can preserve the time of the courts and the caseload for worthy and deserving cases, it would make a lot of sense, particularly with the Covid-19 crisis and the backlog of cases in our courts.<\/p> <p> This legislation will reinforce the importance of the PIAB, an agency for which I have much time.  The emphasis is on seeking a non-adversarial solution to many of these claims and to prevent litigation in the first place.  It is swifter, as well as being much more efficient and effective at solving these problems.  I am heartened that the Government is reviewing the PIAB process with a public consultation under way.  I encourage anybody who has an interest in this area to make a submission to the relevant Department in that regard.<\/p> <p> There is a compensation culture among a small minority.  This legislation will challenge that.  It will stimulate conversation and probably lead in time to the creation of a specialised Garda unit.  I take the Minister's point and that three new forensic accountants are shortly to be employed.  We probably need a specialised insurance fraud Garda unit, however big or however small.<\/p> <p> I support this legislation.  I am grateful to those colleagues who are happy to allow it progress to Committee Stage.  I look forward to further discussions on this and the legislation being enacted as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500057#JJJ00500","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616698500,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their support for this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Once a claim is notified to an insurance company, the company against which the claim has been lodged sees its insurance negatively impacted with the cost of its premia going up.  That is a consequence for the company.  For the person who may have instigated a fraudulent claim, there are no consequences.  That is not right.  This Bill is about fraudulent claims.  The Regional Group is also working with the Minister on the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which is to go to Committee Stage.  We hope this will happen as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is short but important to help turn the tide on the cost of insurance.  I agree with Deputy Berry that we need a specialised Garda unit and control over the pay-out for personal injuries.  I acknowledge the work of Peter Boland and the team at the Alliance for Insurance Reform, as well as ISME, in their efforts over the past number of years to highlight the detrimental effects insurance costs are having on their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  As was stated earlier, Fianna F&aacute;il supported the concept of this Bill in the previous D&aacute;il.  We realise now is the time to act on all of the talk and reports.  Now is the time for action.  Small businesses, voluntary clubs and sports clubs are all at risk.  If they are not able to have insurance cover for their business, clubs or sports facilities, they will not continue to exist.  No one wants to see anybody closing their business because they cannot afford insurance.<\/p>  <p>   Over the years, some companies have been brave enough to pick on the fraudulent claims.  We note the actions of Supermac's in taking on and beating the fraudulent claims against its business.  We cannot rely on the Supermac's of this country, however, to actually do the business without backing them up with legislation.  This legislation will ensure there are consequences for fraudulent claims while helping to reduce claims and premiums.  It must be remembered at the end of the day we are talking about fraudulent claims.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for her support and the Government for allowing the Bill to go through.  I also acknowledge the work of former Deputy, Billy Kelleher, and Deputy Michael McGrath in the previous D&aacute;il for the work they put into this area of insurance.  We have spoken about it forever more.  I know many businesspeople across the country who hold their breath when their insurance premium comes in the door.  They do not know whether they will be able to afford to pay for insurance the following year or how they will pay for it.  It is important that we as legislators provide the necessary support.<\/p>  <p>  The plan in the programme for Government for insurance reform is to be welcomed.  Everybody will support it.  However, we need to have more than just reports or groups.  We need to grasp the nettle.  For too long we are looking for the reasons legislation will not work.  We have got to a stage where we as legislators have to do what we are elected to do.  We have to support the backbone of our economy, our small businesses.  We have to support our sports clubs and the people who are keeping this country ticking over.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward, as do all the members of the Regional Group, to working with the Minister to ensure this country is a better place for small businesses without having to worry about the cost of insurance.  We must ensure that if a fraudulent claim is put in against a small business, it does not have to bear the brunt of the cost or the worry.  Again, I thank the Minister and all Deputies for their support for the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500058#KKK00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616698500,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1616698500,"counter":407,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500058#KKK00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1616698500,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - the need to discuss the appointment of additional inspectors to the Workplace Relations Commission; (2) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss plans for St. Gabriel&rsquo;s Special School in Bishopstown; (3) Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn - to discuss the Government's approach to upcoming EU negotiations on fishing quotas post Brexit; (4) Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon - to discuss a new training programme for garda&iacute; on the need for adequate protection for vulnerable road users; (5) Deputy Steven Matthews - to discuss a review of existing mental health services for adults and children in County Wicklow; (6) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd - to discuss the marking scheme and assessments for the funding application by Louth County Council for the Drogheda urban regeneration project; (7) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss the need to provide additional policing resources for the Finglas area due to an increase in both illegal drug dealing and antisocial activity; (8) Deputy Neasa Hourigan - to discuss plans to establish a banking forum; (9) Deputy Alan Farrell - to discuss the need for Ireland to be an early adopter of the proposed EU digital green certificate to facilitate the safe return to international travel; (10) Deputy Mark Ward - to discuss the access to disability services for children in CHO 7; (11) Deputies Neale Richmond and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill - to discuss issues concerning the operation of the Passport Office; (12) Deputy Willie O'Dea - to discuss the basic rate payable under the wage subsidy scheme; (13) Deputies Mattie McGrath, Carol Nolan and Michael Collins - to discuss the need to open places of worship to limited numbers of people especially for Easter; (14) Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - to discuss the increasing concern of a shortage in places, long waiting lists and numbers of students with no place identified in second level schools in north Dublin for this September; (15) Deputy Brian Stanley - to discuss the protection of turf cutting for domestic use; (16) Deputy Verona Murphy - to discuss the 72-month waiting list for orthodontic treatment; (17) Deputy Gary Gannon - to discuss the need of extra rest room facilities and better lighting in the Phoenix Park; (18) Deputy Paul Donnelly - to discuss measures to protect charity shops that remain closed under level 5 restrictions; (19) Deputy Chris Andrews - to discuss the impact that the winter lockdown had on mental health, and the need to consider permitting outdoor sports like golf, athletics and children's training outdoors; (20) Deputy Pat Buckley - to discuss the very serious lack of places for children with dual diagnosis ASD and intellectual disability in special needs schools in Cork; (21) Deputy Paul McAuliffe - following the publication of Ballymun - a Brighter future to discuss the underlying causes of addiction and crime and plans to tackle open drug dealing in Ballymun; (22) Deputy Martin Kenny - to discuss a shortage of places at the Central Mental Hospital, Dublin; (23) Deputies Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Se&aacute;n Canney - to discuss correspondence received by the Taoiseach from survivors of mother and baby homes; (24) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss the issue the pending job losses at Rehab Logistics Facility at Raheen, Limerick; (25) Deputy Matt Carthy - to discuss current plans for ensuring the opening of the Group Home in Carrickmacross for people with physical and sensory disabilities; (26) Deputy Bernard J.

They are an absolutely vital part of the industrial relations machinery.  I am sure the Minister of State will not disagree with me that in an ideal world we would not need labour inspectors.  However, we do not live in an ideal world, so we do need them.  They perform a vital function.<\/p>  <p>  Just by way of illustration  of what they do and how important they are, in the period 2015 to 2020, WRC inspectors found breaches in employment law in 48%, almost half, of inspections carried out in the meat industry.<\/p> <p>The reason this is so important is that in some sectors, there are workers who may not know what their rights are, who may not speak English as their first language, who may be afraid of their employer or who may have an employer who does not follow the regulations, though most employers do.  Most employers are decent and want to do the right thing and most employers are reasonable to their employees.  However, in 48% of inspections the Workplace Relations Commission's inspectors found that there were breaches of employment law.<\/p> <p> In that period, they also recovered &euro;184,000 on behalf of these workers.  These are not high earners.  It is not a big, high-earning sector.  This sector is marked by low wages and precarious work and &euro;184,000 was recovered by the inspectors on behalf of these workers.  In 92 inspections in the horse racing and equine sector, 340 contraventions were found.  That happened over a two-year period as part of a special project the inspectors undertook.  It is not just about the money the inspectors recover but the fact that when they go to a workplace they are in a position to inform those workers about their rights.  We could debate all day about why workers need more rights at work, because they absolutely do, but these workers can get information on even the minimum entitlements they have from the WRC inspectors.<\/p> <p> I remind the Minister of State that as far back as 2006 I was involved in the negotiations for the Towards 2016 national wage agreement, as part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It was agreed at that stage that there was a need to increase the number of labour inspectors from 31 to 90.  We are nowhere near that figure now.  We have more people at work and some would argue there are more unscrupulous employers acting at the moment, which underlines the very real need for these inspectors.  For the workers whose workplaces they inspect and for whom they find breaches and rectify them, they are worth their weight in gold.  It beggars belief that we have to have this conversation.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister of State values the work of the WRC inspectors and that he will tell me so when he has a chance to speak.  We all value them but we need more of them.  Even with the reduced and limited numbers they have at the moment, they were still able to find breaches of employment law in 48% of inspections in one sector.  To me, that means we need more of them because if we had more we could do more for those workers, uncover more and make their workplaces not just decent places to work but safer places to work as well.  That has to be considered because it is a very important factor. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500058#KKK00800","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616699100,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly and thank the Minister of State for being here to deal with this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500059#LLL00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1616699100,"counter":414,"content":"<p>The Ceann Comhairle will be glad to hear that I am in agreement with the Deputy on this issue.  We have found some common ground and we both recognise the great and important work these inspectors, and the WRC in general, are doing.  They are there to make sure employees are secure in their employment and that their conditions are being met satisfactorily.  That is why we value the work of the WRC and its inspectors.  We are absolutely committed to increasing their numbers.<\/p>  <p>  To give some context, the WRC is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department, which was established on 1 October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  The WRC&rsquo;s core services include: the inspection of employment rights compliance; the provision of information; adjudicating on complaints under employment protection, equality and industrial relations legislation; and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services.  This is all very important work, which Deputy O'Reilly has just gone through as well. <\/p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s inspectors are appointed by the director general with the consent of the Minister, and they exercise such powers as are conferred upon them by the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  Inspectors visit places of employment and carry out investigations on behalf of the WRC in order to ensure compliance with equality and employment related legislation.  These inspections arise in response to complaints of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation, as part of compliance campaigns which focus on specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation, or from routine inspections, announced and unannounced, which act as an overall control measure.  Often their work is targeted at certain key areas, which is why one might see high findings in certain sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  The WRC inspectorate is staffed by civil servants of my Department.  WRC inspectors are ranked at executive officer, EO, and higher executive officer, HEO, level.  As of 19 March 2021, there are a total of 53 WRC labour inspectors, 48 of whom are at EO level and five at HEO level.  My Department is committed to ensuring adequate resourcing is provided to the WRC.  For 2021, the WRC has been allocated &euro;12,566,000 in respect of pay and &euro;2,613,000 in respect of non-pay.  This is an increase of &euro;1 million since 2019.  We have managed to make sure that increase was matched in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  As the Deputy said, commitments were made as far back as 2008 and 2009 to increase the funding for WRC inspectors, which were under a different title at that time.  That is what we had intended to do and we will continue to work to do that.<\/p>  <p>  The national Return to Work Safely Protocol was published on 9 May 2020 in response to the Covid pandemic.  The protocol supported employers and employees in putting measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace when restrictions eased.  Again, this recognised the work of the inspectors.  WRC inspectors carried out on-site inspections in support of the protocol and combined this work with their primary statutory employment related work.  In 2020, the inspectorate division of the WRC carried out over 7,000 inspections in many different areas and has recovered &euro;1,700,000 in unpaid wages.  That is only one part of their work, the other being conditions and so on.  This work continues in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  We will engage with the new chairman of the WRC and with the director general on a regular basis to make sure we can complement the WRC's work and provide the number of people it needs.  An appointments process for new inspectors is ongoing at the moment through the Public Appointments Service and in conjunction with the director general.  We hope to beef up the numbers because we are committed to doing so.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is very important that we do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500059#LLL00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1616699100,"counter":415,"content":"<p>It is all very well to describe who the inspectors are and what they do.

At that time, the parties to the agreement, that is, the social partners, the employers, the employers' representatives, the workers' representatives and the Government, agreed that 90 was the figure that was needed.  We are at 53 now.  We have more people working and living on the island now and working conditions have arguably deteriorated in line with the reduction in trade union density.

I hope the Government will take a leaf from Scotland's book.  This weeks, the Supreme Courts of Scotland stood down a similar measure stating it was a breach of rights under European law.  We have always been great Europeans in this country as is our Government.  We should observe that decision because if the measure in Scotland breaches the rights of people in Scotland, it also breaches our rights.  I appeal to the Cabinet to address this issue, especially for Holy Week and ceremonies.  Funerals cannot be restricted to ten people in cases of big families.  This limit is causing great difficulties for priests, undertakers and everybody else.  This Cabinet will go down in history as the most anti-Christian Cabinet since we got our freedom back, thanks to our gallant leaders in Tipperary and elsewhere who fought for our independence.

I add my voice to this call.  It is fundamentally wrong to deny people in Ireland the right to attend Mass, a service or public worship, depending on their religion.  This Government needs to be fair with people and show some compassion.  People are finding the pandemic very tough and challenging and this is a very dark time for many.  Why not give them the solace of attending their churches with the comfort and support that people get from that?  I commend Canon White, the Catholic priest who took the case in Scotland where worship was found to be legal.  It appears the State here does not know whether public worship is legal or illegal.  That shows us straightaway that it is on shaky ground and very unsure of itself.  The Garda press office was unable to confirm whether public worship is a relevant event under the appropriate legislation.  We are in a very serious situation.

This is not the first time I have responded to the Deputies on this particular issue, which we also discussed it a number of weeks ago.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the current public health restrictions at level 5 will remain in place until 5 April 2021, when a further review will be conducted.  This decision took account of a variety of factors, including the views of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on the current epidemiology of Covid-19 and the need to take decisive action.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains united in its resolve to tackle the spread of Covid-19.  The disease prevention and control strategy we have adopted seeks to prevent the virus spreading among our population to the greatest extent possible.  Based on the current epidemiological situation and the public health restrictions that are in place, it will be necessary to celebrate Easter online at home this year.  This is for the protection of our friends, families and our wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  The basic public health advice and regulatory measures aimed at blocking the transmission of Covid-19 from person to person remain vital.  From the beginning of the pandemic, we have emphasised the many simple measures that can be taken to do this.  They include keeping our distance, washing our hands, wearing a face covering, where required, and avoiding crowds.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 resilience and recovery plan continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance on measures that apply at each level of the framework.  We continue to see good progress but this needs to be sustained.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking on a personal basis, I assure the Deputies that I am extremely conscious of the burdens that have been placed on all members of society as a result of the restrictions that have been imposed.  Many people have been unable to live their lives in the way they normally would or participate in the usual rhythms of their communities.  As Deputy Nolan said, for many people, being able to go to their local church during the season of Lent, Holy Week and Easter and attend mass with their family and friends would be a major source of comfort and solace at a very difficult time for our country and, indeed, the world.  Unfortunately, as Members now know, the environment within which Covid-19 spreads most easily is indoors where a group of people are gathered.  At this moment in time, when we are doing our utmost to break the transmission cycle of the virus, this means we must, regrettably, make every effort to reduce such gatherings.  <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work the Catholic Church and other faiths have done to put in place comprehensive guidelines to protect their communities, in compliance with HSE public health advice.  I hope we will be able to move back from level 5 in the near future.  Consistent with level 5 restrictions, however, religious services have moved online at this time.  Places of worship are open for private prayer and I remind Deputy Collins that they are not closed.  There are exceptions for funerals, at which ten mourners may be in attendance, and weddings, at which six guests may attend.  Importantly, under the current public health regulations, ministers of religion are also permitted to travel to perform a service online, minister to the sick and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.<\/p>  <p>Since March 2020 we have learned to live in a world with this virus.  We succeeded in doing this thanks to the collective efforts of all of us to adhere to the guidelines, and we can do so again.

I will preface my comments on the digital green certificate development by saying in no way am I attempting to ignore public health advice.  In fact, this measure, as designed by the Commission, is being introduced so that we can deal with it when the Covid vaccination programme reaches a particular point in time.  I want to make this absolutely clear to the Minister of State and to my colleagues in the House.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State can appreciate the gravity of the situation when it comes to certain sectors of our society.  The most acute and possibly first affected by Covid-19 was the airline sector and then our tourism sector as a result.  It is a profoundly important sector in our economy.  In 2018 alone, it provided more than 140,000 people with employment and contributed more than &euro;10 billion to the economy in terms of airlines and airports.  I am sure it was more in 2019.  On and off campus in the Dublin region it provides for more than 200,000 jobs.  The importance of the sector and its recovery and ability to recover must be borne in mind.<\/p>  <p>  This evening, the European Parliament committee voted on the digital green certificate, as proposed by the European Commission, with regard to fast-tracking the hearing process and the parliamentary scrutiny process before it goes back to the European Commission for further discussion and debate on the technical merits or demerits of the particular programme.  It is being treated as a priority by the European Commission.  My request of the Government this evening is that Ireland would carefully assess the proposal, as I would expect the Government to do, and develop its own means of adopting it as quickly as it possibly can so that, as I said here yesterday, when Ireland reaches a point where more than 80% of the population have been vaccinated, as the Government has indicated we will reach at the end of June or early July, we are ready to make a decision as to whether our airlines, pilots, cabin crew and ground crew can return to work.  We all want them to do so when it is safe.  My request to the Government this evening is to consider carefully the digital green certificate.  I also ask it to consider carefully the effect it will have on hundreds of thousands of people and their families to hear that the Government is making a plan that includes them.<\/p> <p>It is the same position I adopted yesterday and the same statement I have made on a number of occasions in this House.  It is difficult for the Government to justify making a plan only to have to change it a few weeks or even a few days later, and I appreciate that.  However, if we are planning for two or three months from now, it is a much easier proposition to make.  There is far more understanding in the public sphere and among those pilots, cabin crew, ground crew, chefs, bartenders, waiters and everyone else who relies, to a certain extent, upon the aviation sector.  That is why I would like to see the Government take this seriously and to adopt the digital green certificate once it is has gone through parliamentary scrutiny at the European Parliament and has been agreed by the Commission.<\/p> <p> Again, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for being present to take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500061#NNN00700","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616700900,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Alan Farrell for raising this important issue.  On 17 March 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for a regulation to introduce a digital green certificate.  The aim of the proposal is to facilitate free movement in the EU through a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of certificates relating to vaccination, testing and recovery.  Currently, the epidemiological situation in Ireland and across Europe remains very fragile, with case numbers increasing in many EU countries.  I acknowledge the Deputy addressed this in his presentation.  This is a planning exercise.  The Government's focus now is on avoiding unnecessary international travel, keeping the numbers of new infections low, accelerating the vaccination programme and reopening our economy and society when it is safe to do so.  We are working hard on encouraging citizens to stay the course with restrictive measures pending the roll-out of vaccination programmes.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the value of international travel in the re-establishment of economic activities that rely highly on transport, such as travel and tourism.  I am keen to ensure that every effort should be made to achieve alignment across the EU in preparing for the reopening of travel for non-essential purposes, as soon as it is safe to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has taken proactive actions to mitigate the risk of importing variants of concern into Ireland by introducing a range of measures, including a mandatory passenger locator form, Covid-19 testing and home quarantine requirements for arriving passengers.  Mandatory hotel quarantine has been introduced as an additional element of the public health measures to combat Covid-19, in particular to address the dangers posed by variants of concern.  The Government is continually giving consideration to travel policy, informed by the epidemiological situation internationally and by public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  This proposal builds on previous technical work carried out in the Health Security Committee and the eHealth Network, both of which the Department of Health has engaged with throughout the pandemic.  The Department is engaging constructively in the ongoing technical discussions at EU level, in collaboration with relevant Departments, to ensure we can achieve alignment in regard to a safe return to international travel.<\/p>  <p>  There are issues with the proposed regulation which are being considered at both national and EU level, including scientific and ethical concerns.  There are also reservations about the additional obligations this will place on the health sector, which has been under immense pressure for over a year.  The current focus is on the development of the core systems that support the roll-out of vaccines, and this will remain a priority.  As such, careful consideration is being given to the proposal and its many policy, infrastructural and operational implications across a number of sectors in Ireland and in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has worked strenuously with its EU colleagues throughout this pandemic to ensure co-ordination and alignment, where possible.

I am encouraged by the positive way in which she and the Department have taken this issue.  I completely accept there are certain concerns in regard to the digital green certificate concept and I certainly understand, as the Commission has said, that being vaccinated will not be a precondition for travel.  In fact, all EU citizens have a fundamental right to free movement within the EU and this applies regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not.  The same principle applies to the rights of non-EU nationals staying or residing in EU member states, who have the right to travel to other EU member states.<\/p>  <p>  The digital green certificate will make it easier to exercise that right through testing and recovery certificates.  I completely understand and accept this.  Again, I would like to state I am not, by any means, attempting to suggest that we should be returning to the air tomorrow.  Of course, we should not do that because it is not safe to do so, and only those who have essential reasons to do so should return to the air.  However, in a number of weeks or months, we will be in that position.  I believe this certificate is a good way of providing certainty and clarity to users, to pilots and to everybody on board an aeroplane and in airports by giving the certainty that the vast majority of people in Ireland have been vaccinated.  There is the high probability, of course, that our fellow Europeans will also be vaccinated as well.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, I should say this sort of certificate is not a first.  My colleague in the European Parliament, Colm Markey, MEP, stated this evening that in the 1960s and 1970s, there were smallpox certificates and, prior to that, there were yellow fever certificates, so these are not new developments.  However, I am encouraged by what I have heard this evening and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her response.

The group of workers who are directly affected are some 2,600 workers throughout the country who suffer from a mild physical or mental disability and who, due to a Government initiative, have been allowed to join the workforce.  The reason they have been able to participate in the workforce is because the Government supports the employer through the payment of their wages.  This is known as the wage subsidy scheme, WSS, as opposed to the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, with which we are all familiar since the advent of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  All of those people are working for the minimum wage.  When the scheme was introduced, the rate of payment was about &euro;5.30 per hour and, at the time it was introduced, the payment represented about 70% of the minimum wage.  Because the minimum wage has increased progressively over the years, this payment has remained frozen and, as a result, it now represents only 50%.<\/p>  <p>  Although I am talking about 2,600 people, my main focus has to be the group who have been employed up to now by a company called Rehab Logistics in the Raheen industrial estate in Limerick city.  The company is in the process of making 37 people redundant and 30 of them are beneficiaries of the wage subsidy scheme.  I have had detailed conversations with representatives of Rehab Logistics and they have informed me that because the WSS did not rise in tandem with the minimum wage increases, the operation in Raheen has racked up fairly large losses.<\/p> <p>However, the group might be amenable to keeping those people on in their jobs if that situation were rectified.<\/p> <p> A number of issues must be taken into account here.  First, we have the worst record in the civilised world for employing people with mental or physical disabilities in the main labour force.  Second, the EU public procurement directive of 2014, which allows countries to siphon off part of public contracts specifically to employ disabled people, has never been used in this country.  Most public bodies, including my own county council in Limerick, do not even know of its existence.  Third, for the people I am representing here tonight, their job is their life.  Many of them have aged and infirm parents.  I have heard heart-rending pleas from those parents not to take away the lives of their offspring.  Despite their disability or handicap, these people feel immensely proud and privileged to be part of the workforce.  We must also take into account the fact that there is a very specific and clear commitment in the programme for Government not only to improve the opportunities for people with a disability to become part of the workforce but also to retain those who have managed to achieve that status.  The supreme irony here is that if they cease to be part of the workforce they will be entitled to receive social welfare in the form of the disability allowance, which according to my calculations will cost the State more.  In that situation, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will also have to intervene to help them in various ways and that will add further costs for the taxpayer.  It will cost the taxpayer more to put these people on the scrapheap than to keep them in gainful employment.  That is reprehensible.<\/p> <p> If the Minister, for some reason, is not disposed to increase the rates from &euro;5.30 per hour under the WSS, I suggest the Government should look carefully at the potential for a disability CE scheme here.  I understand there is spare capacity in that area.  Perhaps these people could be accommodated in that way so they can continue to live their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500062#OOO00600","speaker":"1492","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616701500,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Dea for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Department, to outline the position.  The Deputy's question relates specifically to Raheen in Limerick but is also concerned with the WSS in general so I will try to address both the national and local aspects of this.<\/p>  <p>  The WSS is an employment support to private sector employers, the aim of which is to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities and so increase the number of people with disabilities obtaining and sustaining employment in the open labour market.  This is something that we really want to achieve as a Government, as Deputy O'Dea has just outlined.  The scheme provides financial incentives to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment.  Expenditure on the WSS in 2021 is expected to be almost &euro;26 million.  Just under 1,600 employers receive subsidies under the scheme in respect of some 2,600 workers.  It is a demand-led scheme and it is open to any employer to come forward and avail of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The WSS is different from sheltered employment or occupational activity arranged for therapeutic reasons.  The majority of employers who avail of the scheme employ workers in commercial activities and in roles that are open to all workers, not just to people with disabilities.  The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39-hour week.  Where an employer has 23 or more WSS employees, a top-up is applied and the payment rate increases to &euro;7.95 per hour for each employee.  The subsidy rate is not linked to the statutory minimum wage.  It is a contribution paid to the employer, subject to certain conditions, against the cost incurred where a productivity shortfall arises from a disability.  There are different strands in that space.  The contract of employment offered must be for a minimum of six months and the employee is subject to and has the same rights, in accordance with the conditions of employment, as any other employee.  Included in these conditions is the requirement that the employee must be paid the going rate for the job which must be at least the statutory minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the redundancies recently announced at the facility at Raheen in Limerick referred to by Deputy O'Dea.  I extend my sympathy and that of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to the workers in the Rehab Logistics facility who are facing redundancy.  I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved and for their families.  Deputy O'Dea and others have raised their plight and the Departments of Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are working to try to find a solution.  We are happy to engage in conversations with others to try to assist in any way we can.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection is already paying a subsidy of almost 78% of the wages of 35 employees of this particular company.  A further position is subsidised under strand 3.  This is in addition to significant funding provided by the HSE.  Between January and December 2020, the Department paid a total of over &euro;2.3 million in subsidies to the Rehab Group across its various locations, including Limerick.  The payments made to the Rehab Group account for 13.5% of the overall payments made by the WSS in 2020.  The Department is trying to provide an important service in conjunction with the Rehab Group.<\/p>  <p>  At a local level, dedicated staff in the Department have been assigned to work directly with the employees affected by the redundancies at Raheen in Limerick to ensure they receive their proper entitlements and appropriate supports.  The Departments of Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are examining the situation to see what more can be done.  Deputy O'Dea has made some suggestions in that regard tonight which I will feed back into the system.  The Department of Health is also involved in the context of supporting day-care arrangements that may be required by some, but not all, of the workers.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to fine-tune and expand targeted employment schemes such as the WSS to help more people with disabilities to stay in the workforce.  With this in mind, the Department of Social Protection will be carrying out a review of the WSS this year.  That work has commenced already.  Again, I am happy to engage with Deputy O'Dea on some of the solutions he has put forward this evening and to discuss them with the Minister for Social Protection and the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500063#PPP00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1616701500,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I spoke briefly to the Minister for Social Protection earlier and she undertook to consider my suggestion that, at a very minimum, a CE scheme for the disabled should be established here.  This is not a political matter as far as I am concerned.  I am raising this in a non-adversarial, apolitical way.  Most of the people who are losing their jobs in Rehab Logistics are not even in my constituency.  The factory is located in my constituency but most of the staff are from parts of County Limerick that I do not represent, as well as from Cork, Clare and Tipperary.  I have a personal interest in this because I know those people.  I have gotten to know them and their families over the years.  They are beautiful people to whom life has dealt a very bad hand.  In most cases they were born with a mental or physical disability and that has affected how they live their lives.  Their lives have been greatly enhanced as a result of being elevated to a position where they can participate in the economic life of their own country and it makes no sense whatsoever to deprive them of that opportunity, particularly when it will not cost the State a single penny.  In fact, it will probably cost the State to put them on the scrapheap.  Many of the people in question are now in middle age and I do not envisage them getting work again.  Some of their parents and carers are infirm and elderly and are literally pleading with their local representatives to do something to save their employment so they can continue to have something to get up for in the morning.<\/p>  <p>  Before concluding, I must say I am aware that SIPTU has taken the Rehab Group to the WRC twice in the last few weeks.  I abhor and deplore the attitude that Rehab is taking in this particular case.  It is not the function of the Rehab Group to turn its back on these people, to try to walk away from them and to give them reduced redundancy payments, which it is attempting to do at the moment.  The job and function of the Rehab Group is to look after and enhance the lives of those unfortunate people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500063#PPP00300","speaker":"1492"},{"type":"speech","time":1616701500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I understand why Deputy O'Dea has brought this to the floor of the House and I know it is not a political issue for him at all.  Deputy O'Dea and other Deputies and Senators from the area have raised this matter directly with Ministers because they genuinely care.<\/p> <p>This employment opportunity has been very beneficial for those who avail of the scheme and the support.  To be clear, the approach to this is not in any way a cost saving exercise from the Department or the Government.<\/p> <p> The design of the wage subsidy scheme and what it is there to achieve in this regard is to encourage the employment of people who have a disability into employment in a commercial enterprise.  It is not designed as a business or enterprise support.  To fit into the design of the scheme it therefore must be an incentive to encourage employment.  It is not to support the business.  The business has to be able to stand alone on its own two feet as a commercial operation.  That is part of the issue here.<\/p> <p> This does not mean that we cannot try to find other solutions.  The Deputy suggested one scheme but the wage subsidy scheme and the community employment scheme are other solutions.  The Deputy will be aware, and I can inform the House, that our Department and the various arms and agencies of Government have been engaged directly with the unions, the employees and their families along with the Rehab Group to try to work our way through this to find any solution.  We would be very happy to do that and it is something we would like to do.  Deputy O'Dea is aware of that.  He spoke directly on this issue with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, as have I.  We will go through it.  The Department officials and the Intreo offices locally have engaged and would like to be able to find solutions either to try to keep these jobs or to find new jobs, and certainly to work with all involved to do that.  This is what we are committed to doing.  The request to link the wage subsidy scheme to the minimum wage is not the real issue here.  I am aware that it has been put forward as a genuine attempt to find a solution but that is not the space we are in.  We will try to work with the Deputy to find other solutions also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500063#PPP00400","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616702100,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; ar fad as a gcomhoibri&uacute; i rith na seachtaine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500064#QQQ00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616702100,"counter":444,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 8.52 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 March 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
