Some Deputies are appearing remotely from their offices within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  I ask those who are attending remotely to confirm they are within the precincts to fulfil that constitutional requirement.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings on 4 and 9 March have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.<\/p> <p>  The next item of business on today&rsquo;s agenda is correspondence.  We have a substantial amount to deal with.  The Committee of Public Accounts has traditionally considered its correspondence in public session but due to Covid-19 restrictions, revised meeting arrangements have limited the committee&rsquo;s opportunities to meet in public.  We have mainly used that time to fulfil our core role, which is to examine the accounts of public bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  <\/p> <p>  However, we have set aside time today to consider a number of items of correspondence.  Decisions of the committee on items of correspondence that are not addressed at today&rsquo;s meetings are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings which are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p> <p>  No. 381B is from Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, chief executive of Children's Health Ireland, dated 17 February 2021 providing information requested by the committee on non-compliant procurement.  At our meeting on 25 February, we decided to note and publish this item.  It was also agreed to hold it over for consideration in public.  This item is flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is quite difficult to get the context of this response.  A few matters jumped out to me.  One was the payment of &euro;121,000 to the Combined Media company relating to the development, launching and management of the Children's Health Ireland jobs website.  A further &euro;83,000 was paid to Q4 Public Relations.<\/p><p>None of us expects the changes for children's health to come without a cost.  We are trying to keep a close eye on what we are spending and what we are getting for it.  We heard recently from the oversight body for the procurement of the children's hospital that there is substantial slippage in the timeline.  There may well be costs associated with things having to be upgraded while we are waiting for that to be completed.  Some of these are network supports and specialised services that are being brought in.<\/p><p>Why does it need to spend &euro;121,000 on the Children's Health Ireland jobs website which seems like a large amount of money with further money spent on public relations and communications?  Those kinds of things jump out at me.  It is understood that good IT systems are required, but the expectation is that those IT systems in the main will focus on clinical or operational issues.

While in the overall budgets these might seem like small amounts of money, why would a State agency that is charged with building a children's hospital and providing for children's health need to commission a stand-alone PR company to carry out its work?<\/p> <p>  The response from Children's Health Ireland outlines part of the tender process that was employed, but it does not outline the rationale as to why this was required in the first place.  Similarly, there was a very large outlay of funding of in excess of &euro;121,000 on the Combined Media company.

While I know that in the greater scheme of things it is a relatively small amount of money, there is a principle involved here.  It is now the norm that however small a State agency or an arm of the State may be, as a matter of practice one of the PR companies is retained to advise.<\/p> <p>  Of the amounts of money that were spent, as outlined by Deputy Catherine Murphy, what proportion was used in preparation of personnel to appear before Oireachtas committees?<\/p><p>I think that is in part what this money was used for.

I very much disagree with that.  We have seen the importance of communications over recent months.  My difficulty is with the retention of an external company for that service.

There is a difference.  Perhaps, the Comptroller and Auditor General can help us.  It looks like the communications contract was initiated prior to the coming into existence of Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  The use of the word \"completed\" confused me.  Does it mean the contract ended in 2020 and there has been no contract for 2021?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the jobs website, the word \"management\" would imply that there is one or a number of people working on the site on a constant basis.

There is a circular argument there.

As they are related, I will address each of them before opening the floor to members.<\/p> <p> The first of the three is correspondence item No. 396 B, from Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, and dated 24 February.  Mr. Kavanagh wishes to clarify information provided during our meeting with HRI on 23 February 2021.  He believes his exchange with me regarding the provision of funding for CCTV at racecourses around the country could have given the incorrect impression that &euro;9.1 million was allocated in the 2018 integrity services budget for CCTV when, in fact, &euro;9.1 million represented the total budget.  The allocation for CCTV systems was &euro;60,000.  Mr. Kavanagh goes on to say that midway through the year, the IHRB requested that the &euro;60,000 be reallocated to the development of an online trainers licensing system, with the issue of CCTV funding to be revisited in future budgets.  At our meeting on 4 March we decided to clarify this publicly.  As well as holding it over for consideration in public, we also decided to request the IHRB to provide an information note regarding CCTV systems, including why the proposed systems were not installed at more than one racecourse.  I will come to that response shortly.<\/p> <p>  The second item of the three is correspondence item No. 423.  It too is from Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive, Horse Racing Ireland.  It is dated 4 March and provides follow-up information relating to 14 questions arising from our meeting with HRI on 23 February.  At our meeting on 11 March we decided to note and publish this item.<\/p> <p>  The third and final related item is correspondence item No. 439 B.  It is from Mr. Denis Egan, chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, and is dated 11 March.  It is the response I mentioned to our correspondence to IHRB regarding CCTV installations at racecourses.  Mr. Egan states that &euro;60,000 was originally allocated in the IHRB&rsquo;s budget to provide CCTV at four racecourses but that the HRI took over the project in March 2018 and the funds were then transferred to its budget.  However, the project did not commence in 2018 and the money went back to the IHRB.  This money is doing the rounds.  Mr. Egan states that money - a total of &euro;80,000 this time - was again allocated for CCTV systems in the HRI budget of 2019.<\/p><p>However, the project had not started by July 2019, so the money again went back to the IHRB.  The correspondence goes on to give some detail about the online licensing system that was prioritised over CCTV systems, including the IHRB's request that the &euro;80,000 be allocated to online licensing and the board of HRI's agreement to that request.  Despite being requested of the IHRB, though, the current position regarding the installation of CCTV systems is not addressed.  I propose that we note and publish this item and reiterate the committee's request to the IHRB to clarify the current situation regarding the roll-out of CCTV systems at racecourses around the country and to include budget allocations and timelines for installation.<\/p><p> I am baffled.

There are a hell of a lot of unanswered questions.  When HRI appeared before the committee, it outlined the situation as regards funding of CCTV and indicated that, following installation at a single racecourse stables in 2017, funding had been provided to extend the installation to all courses.  We were made aware that, at the start of 2018, a change in the laboratory that was being used by the regulatory board had seen an increase of, I believe, more than 400% in the number of positive tests.  Six months later, though, the regulatory board sought to divert the funds away from the installation of CCTV to an online integrity portal.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, HRI has been forthcoming with information pertaining to itself, but its relationship with the regulatory board is an odd one because it seems to obscure the situation.  I suggest that the committee write directly to the regulatory board requesting a briefing on the proposed installation of CCTV from 2017 onwards and to include in that briefing detailed notes on changes in budget allocations.  I also suggest that we request a note from the regulatory board on the integrity portal or whatever it is - the board referred to it as being an online trainers licensing system - so that we might get a better understanding of it.  HRI indicated that the regulatory board was the expert in this area and had a better understanding of how the money would be spent, but it seems very odd.  The relationship between the two bodies is obscuring information.  We need these questions answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#D00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The context is that just short of &euro;80 million, which comes from the gambling tax, goes to HRI.

All credit goes to Ms Rachael Blackmore for lifting many people's spirits.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the integrity fund.  We need to protect that investment and the large number of people working in this sector.  The sector must be above reproach, and the money for CCTV at stables is meant for that purpose.  Even though the funding was allocated in 2018, CCTV had only been installed at the stables of only one racecourse when we met HRI this year.  There is still confusion about what the expectation was exactly when the money was allocated.  When will every racecourse be fully covered by CCTV?<\/p> <p>  I am uneasy with the crossover between the two boards.  Three people from the regulatory board are on the board of HRI.  I am concerned about the lack of separation and whether that was done by design.  It is important that we have clarity about this aspect.<\/p> <p>  The situation with the allocation is not clear.  As the Chairman stated, the money has gone back and forth before being diverted.  Installing CCTV at 26 racecourses is not an onerous project and I do not know why it has not been done.

We must have clarity on this.

I share Deputy Catherine Murphy's concerns that the racing authority and regulatory board seem to have an intertwined relationship.  I am not sure that that is necessarily healthy.

My only regret is that I did not back her, but that is just the way things go.<\/p> <p>  I will refer specifically to correspondence No. 423B from HRI, which contained responses to questions that we raised.  Sometimes, people infer that when committees like ours question how public money is spent, we are attacking the principle of supporting the horse racing sector.  This sector provides a valuable contribution to our rural economy but could it do more for more people?<\/p><p> Members will recall when we had Horse Racing Ireland before the committee and I questioned its decision, which essentially ensures that the State funding or the taxpayers' money that is invested is redistributed through prize money.  In the year in that we are discussing, which this correspondence deals with, the State's contribution to HRI was &euro;67 million and the prize money awarded that year was &euro;66 million but when I put it to HRI that this was consolidating a small number of top trainers in particular, it disputed that and argued that the money had trickled down, so that was trickle-down economics at its best, and that much more outside of.the official figures went to breeders across the country.  In this response, it shows that of that prize money of &euro;66 million, a sum of &euro;385,000 went to breeders.  Clearly, it is not the case that breeders, particularly smaller breeders, get a substantial part of the funding.  Clearly, there are some sectors within the horse racing family that are less profitable or benefit less than others.  The point-to-point racing sector, which we correctly hear is the breeding ground for future successes, received circa &euro;900,000 per annum but, again, that is from a prize fund of &euro;66 million in 2019.  Consequently, I propose that we write to HRI.  I also propose that we write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ask it whether it is satisfied that the prize money and prize fund distribution are the best way to redistribute State funds to have the maximum beneficial impact on rural economies and on the future growth of the sector.  We should ask the Department whether, in its view the prize money and prize fund distribution are the best way to ensure that as many people as possible receive a benefit and that as many communities as possible receive an economic benefit from the substantial State contribution that is invested in the sector.  That is my formal proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#D00700","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I agree and concur with all my colleagues and request that the committee writes to HRI.

I did ask Mr. Kavanagh if we could have a copy of his submission to the Department on point-to-point racing because, as one can see, a sum of &euro;900,000 was paid out for point-to-point prize winning.  I questioned where would the money go or be spent if point-to-point races were not run?<\/p> <p>  Equally, we now see a situation arising where our point-to-point entrants are going elsewhere.  They should be racing in this State but we are not open because we have no further plan to get us out of level 5.

There is very little transparency about salaries in the accounts and HRI used something it states it submitted to the Department outlining that it has some form of an amnesty.

I thank the Secretary General for his reply; it is most comprehensive.  There is some very useful information in it.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on the issue of the national broadband plan, we know that an attempt is being made to reduce costs by using metropolitan area networks, MANs, and existing poles from Eircom.  Analysys Mason is one of the entities that provided technical guidance.  I recall that it produced a report, and when representatives appeared before the committee, that report was a year old.  When it was published, the upshot of the report was that we were told that the use of these facilities would halve the cost of broadband.<\/p> <p>  We know that the national broadband plan is about the number of houses that are passed.  However, the number of premises that are connected will be determined, in some cases, by the cost of broadband.  In keeping an eye on this project, we must ask the Department for an update on analysis that has been done.  At the point that this Analysys Mason report was provided, Ireland had the most expensive broadband in Europe.  It is absolutely right that existing facilities are leveraged to reduce the cost, but we need to know if the Department is keeping an eye on the end user cost because that will determine the entities that run it.  We are told that any benefit will come back to the State.  It is important, therefore, that we keep an eye on that.<\/p> <p>  On the Eversheds Sutherland report on RT&Eacute;, we wrote to RT&Eacute; seeking a response.  I have not seen a clarification in respect of the 78 people who had accepted permanent contracts of employment, as opposed to permanent contracts for services.  There is no doubt that an organisation such as RT&Eacute; will need to have people on contracts for services, given the nature of the business.  However, there was a cohort of people that should have been on staff or on contracts of employment.<\/p> <p>  This issue really matters because it is an example of a practice that will be taking place elsewhere.  RT&Eacute; has formally offered those people contracts but we must ensure we receive a proper response on whether the contracts will apply retrospectively.  It can make a sizeable difference to people, for example, in respect of pension entitlements later on, taxation forgone by Revenue, and also in respect of the number of years of employment completed, should a person be made redundant.  Therefore, it is most important that we stick with it, watch out for a response and do not let the matter slip.<\/p> <p>  On the Eircode system, we have heard about public awareness.  We have been told that public awareness is being monitored and it is clear that there are public awareness targets.  However, do we know if there is any evidence of usage of this pretty expensive system?  I would have thought that outcomes would have been sought in relation to that.  The system is a valuable one, for example, for the National Ambulance Service, but are people generally using it outside of that?  The design of the system was previously heavily criticised in respect of how it might be used.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of CCTV and illegal dumping, the Data Protection Commission is engaging with the City and County Management Association.  Very often, people have expectations that CCTV will sort everything out.  Local authorities have a scheme in place to tackle the problem.  I do not know whether it is active in each local authority area at this point.  However, the Data Protection Commission has a problem with the scheme, which means that it cannot be used.  There seems to be something odd about us providing grants for a scheme on the one side and on the other side an entity of the State having concerns, or more than that, about it being used.  What are the circumstances that allow CCTV to be used legally?  Are we spending money on grants that are not going to provide a return on that investment and the investment of community time because it is down to individuals?  There is matching funding for a dumping initiative, if I remember rightly.  While the initiative might be valuable, if it cannot be used, we must question the value of it.  We must also ask what needs to be put in place for the Data Protection Commission in respect of who can access the information to make the scheme an active one.  Those are the main issues I wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#F00700","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The committee previously expressed disappointment that the Eversheds Sutherland report was not published and that we only received it in summary format.<\/p><p>I understand that RT&Eacute; will appear before the committee in the next couple of weeks.

Everyone else is happy enough with it.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of points regarding the report from the Secretary General, Mr. Mark Griffin.  I must say it is very comprehensive.  A study is being carried out regarding the potential use of the Lough Ree and Shannonbridge power plants.  The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, requested a study be undertaken, according to the correspondence from the Secretary General.  It sets out that a feasibility study into the options for the future use of the existing infrastructure in west Offaly and Lough Ree has been undertaken over recent months.  Members will remember and note those two power plants ceased operations earlier this year.  The question, and the context in which I raised this with Mr. Griffin on the day he appeared before the committee, is that they are located strategically on the national grid in an area where large land banks are to be used for solar panels and sensitively located wind turbines.  I stress the words \"sensitively located\".  They are on fairly extensive sites which could be used for biomass or biogas.  We note the group that has undertaken the work is expected to conclude shortly.  I ask the clerk to the committee to request that we be kept abreast by the Department and the Secretary General, Mr. Griffin, of any progress.  There is huge concern in the midlands that those two sites do not become land with plant rusting away on them.  They are in a very strategic location on the grid to be brought into future use.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is regarding the CCTV cameras, which has been alluded to already.  From speaking to local authorities and from having raised the issue with Mr. Griffin when the Department appeared before the committee, my understanding is that the legislation must be changed to facilitate the use of CCTV to try to counter illegal dumping, which is a problem in my constituency of Laois&ndash;Offaly.  I am sure it is a problem in every other constituency throughout the country, and it is not getting better.  Local authorities were using cameras, and it was possible to move them from one location to another.  The Data Protection Commission intervened and said they must stop because there is a question mark over legislation and the legalities of all this, and legislation must be framed for it.  I ask that we send a note to the Secretary General of the Department asking that the legislation be brought forward to the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.  It is a very real problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#G00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>In his correspondence, the Secretary General, Mr. Griffin, mentions that a value for money review of the Eircode system will  be conducted at some point this year.

I am not happy with the response from UL at all.  Regarding the representatives from the university appearing before the committee, I want to ensure that the invitation in that regard is all-encompassing.  I state that because we want to discuss a series of issues not dealt with adequately as a result of the work of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It was even suggested that the Garda fraud squad be requested to look at this.  I made such a formal request previously to the then president or chancellor of the university, or whatever position it was at the time.  The answer I got was that he would take that under advisement.  I certainly felt that a cursory look at the situation by the Garda was necessary, at a minimum, such was the material available to us.  We will want to go over that ground and I am conscious that we have these new Standing Orders now, which are for our benefit.  I want to ensure, therefore, that whatever we have to say is covered, and that the request, for example, would be something like, \"Dear UL, we want to discuss everything, yours sincerely\".  The subject matter of the invitation is important in ensuring we can cover everything.<\/p> <p>  On protective disclosures generally, the system is totally stacked.  I happily advise anyone thinking of issuing a protected disclosure to not do so in the current environment, because he or she will be thrown under the bus, penalised and subject to different treatment.  Outwardly, the situation will be dressed up as being one which is open, where people are encouraged to come forward and there is a desire to improve, and all that kind of stuff.  There is one proviso, however, and that is it does not make the system or the organisation look bad.  That is the problem with the current situation.  I refer to the idea of farming such matters out to a senior counsel, who is picked, and the terms of reference then be determined by people in-house in an organisation or in a Department or whatever.  I refer to all the vested interests who do not want a negative outlook on a Department or agency or a portion of a Department or agency.  <\/p> <p>  I do not know if that is work for this committee, the Joint Committee on Justice or other committees, but we must start from scratch regarding protected disclosures, protecting whistle-blowers and ensuring that what we have seen time and time again, such as in the case of Maurice McCabe, for example, who was very high profile, does not happen.  All of us, as Deputies and members of this committee, have seen many examples of people who have not ended up as part of a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme, but for all the world have suffered comparable discrimination and penalisation through, in effect, trying to improve their workplaces and make them fairer and better for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#H00800","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I would like to make a brief point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#H00900","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Go ahead, briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#H01000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I am curious as to whether this is something ever sought by the Comptroller and Auditor General, not within the context of accounts, obviously, but people often bring forward information.

Not every protected disclosure will be found to be correct, but people are really putting their heads above the parapet.  We must then interrogate whether those people who have brought protected disclosures forward are still in the jobs they were in before bringing forward information, which may have been of value in changing a workplace culture.

It was very surprising.  Its approach to this committee leaves a lot to be desired.  The tone of the interaction at the committee hearing and in Caranua's written correspondence is unlike anything we have received in my time on this committee.  It is important for me to put that on the record.  I do not believe that I or any other member of this committee intended to engage with Caranua in a confrontational way.  We were all simply putting what I thought were standard questions - in some instances, on behalf of survivors of institutional abuse.  The responses from Caranua were over the top.<\/p><p>I am particularly uncomfortable with the assertion that has now been made in a number of items of correspondence and was repeated on several occasions at the hearing.  I will quote directly from the most recent correspondence from the CEO, Rachel Downes, in which she states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI suggested that members of the Committee could discuss matters that were presenting as a concern after the hearing. I have received no request from any member to discuss matters subsequent to my attendance before the Committee. <\/blockquote> <p>Repeatedly during the hearing and in other correspondence, this same assertion has been made that members could have a private chat with the CEO to discuss matters.  This shows a lack of appreciation for the role of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Our role is not to satisfy our own desire for information.  Our role is to put questions on behalf of the Irish taxpayer and Irish citizens.  I would have thought that previous experience would have shown that private conversations in car parks are not the way in which witnesses or bodies should be interacting with this committee.  I wanted to put all of that on the record.  <\/p><p>It is also important that we correspond with the Department of Education to get a detailed framework as to how the issues pertaining to Caranua will move and be addressed because the explanation outlined to us that a new board will be put in place without staff and without a budget to all intents and purposes yet some executive responsibility will lie within the Department is a recipe for disaster.  It is, therefore, very important that we get clarification on that as speedily as possible.  My proposal is that we write to the Secretary General of the Department seeking that clarification, the framework for how the work of Caranua will proceed, a timeframe for the legislation to formally wind down Caranua and a subsequent framework for how outstanding issues relating to institutional abuse and claims may be dealt with in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#K00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Just to clarify, I think the Deputy included in his proposal - if not, it needs to be included - that we look for progress on the two cases that were addressed with Caranua from the Department.

No. 436 is a letter to me as Chairperson of the committee, dated 10 March, and No. 443 includes a request for updates relating to the letter.  Part of the discussion on 9 March concerned Bibby Financial Services Ireland because it is in receipt of funding detailed in the SBCI financial statements.  No. 436, the letter from Bibby Financial Services, makes a number of points arising from that discussion and as the company was not represented at the meeting and, therefore, did not have the right of reply, I believe it is appropriate that the committee should note the following points that were made in the letter: Bibby states that it has at all times operated in accordance with the terms and covenants of its agreement with SBCI and in compliance with all other regulations in Ireland.  Bibby states that none of the funding it received as part of its agreement with SBCI has been used by the Bibby Line Group or Bibby Financial Services' UK business.  Bibby strongly refutes any suggestion that it has operated in an unlawful way at any time or has acted outside the terms of its agreement with SBCI.  Bibby states that it has undergone rigorous due diligence and audit processes on a number of occasions with SBCI and has met all requirements on all occasions.  Bibby states that it is proud of its role in supporting the Irish economy and that it has made more than &euro;600 million available to Irish SMEs since 2018.  I propose that we note and publish No. 436 and advise Bibby accordingly.  Is that agreed?  In the correspondence advising Bibby of the decision, I will inform Bibby about the option of making a submission under Standing Order 711 in the event that it is unhappy with the way in which the matter has been dealt with.  In relation to SBCI, the secretariat is compiling the questions that members have submitted for it to respond to.  I understand there are currently more than 30 questions and we will consider these at our meeting tomorrow.  We are seeking a lot of information from SBCI regarding this.  As has been outlined, there are more than 30 questions to be put.  I remind members that when we talk about an entity or body that is not present, we should be careful regarding our legal requirements.  I will open it up to the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#K00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the Chairman read out the letter from the relevant company.  It is more than entitled to do so.  Our issue as a committee is with the SBCI and the lending of money that was envisaged for a particular purpose.  Of course, it will understand, as, I am sure, does the company that wrote to us does, that we have a responsibility to examine that.  Many questions have been submitted and I know they will be laundered through the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser tomorrow.  I have not submitted my questions yet because I do not intend to have them laundered by anybody.  I have my own legal advisers, who can advise on that.  My analysis of this particular transaction is a matter of major concern to me.  The auditors of the company that wrote to the Chairman have resigned.  It is a matter of concern whether SBCI would have been aware of that at the time we were questioning about this matter.  If it was not aware of it, what was the reason?  Other issues do not make me comfortable that the money that was lent was lent for the purposes for which it was intended.  That may be a failing, as I was at pains to point out at our previous meeting, which I know was in private.  In fairness to the company in question, I am happy to say publicly that the failing may have been with the original legislation and oversight of it by the Oireachtas.  It may have been failings in the legislation itself but it is our responsibility to get to the bottom of it because of the amount involved.  Certainly the spirit of the legislation, which I was in the House for when it was put through, is not captured in this.  There is no suggestion that the company did anything wrong but it may well be the case that SBCI or indeed Members of these Houses did.  We have a responsibility to find out whether this is the case.  I formally propose that notwithstanding any considerations tomorrow at our private meeting, we invite SBCI back before us to examine this transaction in detail.<\/p><p>Moreover, the invitation should specifically point out that we want to talk in detail about this transaction and no other.  An all-encompassing invitation should be issued so that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland representatives are in no doubt whatsoever about the need to have all details with them in respect of underwriting, due diligence and everything else in order that we can go through all of this in detail.  I am afraid information given at the meeting by the SBCI representatives does not tally with the information in this letter or other information provided to me and other members of the committee.<\/p><p> It is a matter without prejudice to anyone.  It may well be our fault - the fault of Deputies and Senators in these Houses.  This requires and demands a public investigation with SBCI without prejudice to the company involved.  That is our responsibility.<\/p><p> In advance of our private meeting tomorrow I want to put a point on the record.  Parliamentary privilege exists for a reason.  Sometimes, where the Legislature crosses with private society and the commercial world, it is necessary to refer to certain entities and companies and, at times, individuals.  That is the very reason parliamentary privilege exists in a democracy.  It is beyond ridiculous and absurd in the extreme to wall ourselves off to the extent that we cannot do our job in holding ourselves and the public purse to account.  That is what I intend to do regardless of any advice tomorrow.  I believe and hope colleagues will approve the proposal today.  I do not want it to go to a private discussion tomorrow.  I wish to formally propose that, as a matter of urgency, we bring SBCI representatives back in to discuss that transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#K00800","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Essentially, the purpose of SBCI, or this particular aspect of the entity, was to ensure that the funding was to be used exclusively for the Irish economy and for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Obviously, Bibby Financial Services Ireland is a component of the arrangements.

It appears to be a perplexing situation.  The HSE has outsourced the running of the doctor on call services to a private company.  The HSE is under the impression that this company has an obligation to provide particular services in some parts of Cork.  We are told that on 14 March last year SouthDoc closed 11 facilities across counties Cork and Kerry.  On 18 and 29 September and on 1 October the HSE wrote to SouthDoc requesting the restoration of a service plan for Listowel and Blackpool.  SouthDoc sent a letter stating it is not planning to open either Listowel or Blackpool.<\/p> <p>  This is a potentially very serious matter and it is crucial we get a full appraisal from the HSE as to how it finds itself in this position where services to local communities are being essentially denied by a private company which has received &euro;7.294 million in 2019 and 2020.  How can an organisation be in receipt of that level of taxpayers' money and yet refuse point blank to provide a service?

The current situation is that the provision of services is totally on one side of the city and there is not access by bus or other public transport to the location on the south side of the city.  Even the people on the south side do not have bus access to that location.  There is a major question, if a proper reorganisation was done, about whether one centre in the city centre would be far more effective than the way it is now.

Before we begin, I remind members that, in the context of the Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman or Vice Chairman and staff are present in the committee room.  All members must join remotely from somewhere else in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat will issue an invitation to join the meeting on Microsoft Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting if they are outside the parliamentary precincts.  Members are asked to mute their microphones except when they are making a contribution and to use the raise your hand function on Teams to indicate.  It should be noted that messages sent on the chat function are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The first item of business is a statement by the Vice Chairman on behalf of the joint committee in respect of a complaint regarding Dr. Finbarr Heslin arising from further correspondence after the meeting of 12 November 2019.  The joint committee has been sent correspondence by Dr. Heslin, who took issue with a statement made on 12 November 2019 before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine of the previous D&aacute;il.  Dr. Heslin was not present at this meeting and had no opportunity to respond to the statement made.  An issue arises in addressing Dr. Heslin's complaint in that the committee in question no longer exists because of the dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il.  Joint committees are established by each D&aacute;il and Seanad to shadow relevant Departments as constituted by the Government.  This committee was constituted by a different Government and Seanad and is not a continuation of any committee of the last parliament session.  As such, there is no obligation on the committee to respond.<\/p> <p>  In the ordinary course of events, the committee would not seek to traverse the work of a previous committee.  However, the committee is mindful of the decision made by the committee of the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il and Twenty-Fifth Seanad to allow a statement to be read into the record in order to address Dr. Heslin's concerns.  In the interim, the D&aacute;il and Seanad were dissolved and no further action could be taken.  In these circumstances, through no fault of the committee of the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il and Twenty-Fifth Seanad, this matter was left only partly addressed.  The committee is mindful of addressing the matter and can do so by removing it or bringing the matter to a close.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Heslin's concerns appear to be twofold.  First, he takes issue with a statement made by a witness regarding the veracity of an assessment made in an RT&Eacute; documentary on the greyhound industry.  As a matter of principle, it must be said that witnesses appearing before the committee have the right to state the facts at hand and members have the right to question the testimony given by the witnesses with a different viewpoint, which is not always compatible.  It is not the responsibility or role of a committee to adjudicate on these statements or on whether witnesses are agreeable.  However, the committee notes for the record that, while witnesses from the Irish Greyhound Board called into question the accuracy of some statements made by Dr. Heslin in the RT&Eacute; documentary, Dr. Heslin continues to stand over every statement he made in that documentary and has provided this committee with a detailed explanation as to why he maintains these positions are correct.<\/p> <p>  Second, Dr. Heslin takes issue with a statement made by Deputy Cahill during the hearings as a member of the committee in the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il regarding Dr. Heslin's contribution.  Dr. Heslin believes that the Deputy questioned whether he had breached the ethics of this profession.  Dr. Heslin wishes to state for the record that for 26 years he has practised and consulted in the area of animal welfare both in Ireland and in Europe and that his reputation for upholding the cause of animal welfare, including the welfare of greyhounds, is beyond reproach.  The committee is agreeable to noting this position.  However, for the sake of completeness, the committee notes that after reviewing the statements made by Deputy Cahill, it does not believe that he stated that there was a breach of the ethics of Dr. Heslin's profession but insists that he was referring to a disagreement between witnesses regarding the factual accuracy of the statements made by Dr. Heslin.  The committee has no issue with Deputy Cahill's contributions.  The committee does not anticipate taking this matter any further and wishes to consider it closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#A00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616457600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.38 p.m. and resumed at 6.39 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1616457600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Deputy Jackie Cahill took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The topic for today's meeting is the regulation of veterinary medicines.

They compare Ireland with Denmark and the Netherlands in some detail.  I take it that is because those two countries would be considered to be operating best practice.  At several points in the submission, they mention that Ireland is many years behind both countries.  The table provided is very useful.  Some of the stewardship measures in the Netherlands have been introduced fairly recently.  Will Ireland remain years behind no matter what or is it possible for it to advance some of the measures that have been outlined as important in the fight against antimicrobial resistance in a speedy timeframe if the measures were agreed at a political level?  In other words, is the infrastructure in place to allow us to do this sooner?<\/p> <p>  Much of our debate on this EU regulation has focused on the potential impact it will have on licensed merchants and others who currently distribute some products.  The witnesses' analysis suggests that Denmark is the flagbearer for best practice.  I understand that the distribution of veterinary medicines in Denmark and Sweden is very similar to the primary care system that operates here in Ireland for human medicine.  In other words, there is a separation of prescribing and dispensing of veterinary medicines.  Should we examine that model for Ireland to ensure there is a multi-stakeholder approach as has been advocated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the Chief Veterinary Officer, CVO, and also remove any potential financial incentive for somebody to overprescribe?  I am not suggesting that is a widespread practice, but it is always possible somebody will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#B00600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will seek to answer these questions and then I might ask my colleagues to follow up.  In response to the first question, certainly Denmark and the Netherlands are leading.  We did not choose them solely for that reason.  It was also because, as I stated in the footnote on page 3, the dairy sectors are quite similar in having a very strong export perspective and also a focus on the highest-quality product, for example, with infant formula.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we would always be behind those countries.  I certainly hope not.  I think they provide factors critical to success and they are fundamentally focused on an integrated, proactive, forward-thinking approach.  Even the Dutch, who came later, have rolled it out over a ten-year period.  We do not have that much time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the critical factors for success, some of them, for example the banning of preventive use, will happen anyway because of the new regulation.  The national database will also happen; Ireland is required to enact that.  We have an opportunity to introduce benchmarking nationally by sector, by farm, by prescriber.  We need clarity on the level of veterinary oversight.  I believe they provide international best practice about what that means, including a one-to-one relationship between vet and farmer, mandatory veterinary visits which could be timed with other veterinary visits of course, an annual evaluation of plans, treatment guidelines, national targets and restriction on these highest priority critically important antimicrobials.  I absolutely believe that we can catch up, but we need to move to this proactive approach.<\/p> <p>  In the paper, I highlight some decisions that have been made in the past and are still active, which we believe really constrain progress.  They essentially do not really address some of the hard questions we need to address.<\/p><p> Deputy Carthy spoke about decoupling.  Veterinarians have differing objectives that relate to both the welfare of the animal and also the business reality.  That is accepted.  Different countries have taken different approaches, such as, for example, Sweden and Italy.  My understanding is that vets in Italy cannot sell veterinary medicinal products.  In Denmark, the approach is different in that the percentage of profit that can be made from those products is capped at 5% to 10%.  The Dutch, who did a detailed review back in 2011, took a completely different approach.  They decided that the best way forward was to have prescriber benchmarking and one-to-one relationships.  Essentially, this means that detailed information is necessary in the level of veterinary oversight.  These are all different approaches to the same issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the fine statement they forwarded to members before the meeting.

Our firm view is that a level of veterinary oversight on intramammary antibiotics is critical and, therefore, test results are important with respect to those.  As we highlight and argue in our paper, it is important to have detailed veterinary oversight of the mastitis situation.  I hope the Deputy can understand that we are not here with expertise on antiparasitics but we are here to discuss another area that is critical to veterinary medicines, namely, the prescribing of intramammary antibiotics.  In Ireland, that is different from other member states and will need to be considered carefully in light of the new veterinary medicines regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Deputy McNamara indicated that he would like to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#C00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I meant to indicate that I wish to speak later in the meeting.

Could they elaborate on the prescriber benchmarking and what they mean by that?  Would they have a concern if there is a different regime being used north of the Border, which for many farmers is only walking distance across an invisible line?  Are they concerned that we should be in line with each other, North and South, to achieve the best outcomes for our farmers and the industry?  I note the mention of Denmark and Netherlands in the submission.  The witnesses talked about veterinary practitioners and one has to look at the smaller farmer as against the bigger farmer.  The witnesses are not bothered about cost but do they think there is a danger that it will cost smaller farmers an awful lot more because the bigger guys will be getting more stuff?  If this goes down the road that it seems to be going down, would the witnesses recommend that it would be better to have a separation, as Deputy Carthy pointed out earlier, such as in the example of a doctor and a chemist?  One could get the prescription in one place and get the medicine in the other.  It is hard for a farmer to walk into a veterinary practitioner's office and ask for a prescription and then walk down the road and get it at the local co-operative, for example.  What are the witnesses thoughts on that for the benefit of the whole industry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#C00600","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I might pass the second, third and fourth questions to my colleague, Ms McAloon, but I would like to tackle the first question on prescriber benchmarking.  What has happened in Denmark and, in particular, in the Netherlands is that they set up systems to capture prescribing data.  That is first used to understand how much antibiotic is used and then to benchmark.  This means that they are seeking to understand the situation at national level, then at the sectoral level, then at the level of the prescriber and finally at the level of the farm.  I will focus on the prescriber.  They capture prescribing data electronically and then for each prescriber in the country, after taking account of the type of farms they prescribe to and of the species involved, such as, for example, pigs versus cattle, they are then able to determine who prescribed the heaviest 10% of product.  These are the people who they then spend some time essentially talking through the prescribing practices with in order to try to see why it is that they are such heavy prescribers.<\/p> <p>  These prescribing targets, which are farm and prescriber targets, have proved to be one of the critical factors for the Dutch, for example.  They set a target of reducing the amount of antimicrobial medicinal products used in food production by 20% in 2009.  By 2011, they had dropped it down to 50% of 2009 targets and by the time they got a little bit further, they said they could reduce the total amount of antimicrobial medicinal products used in the country by 70%.  They have continued to drive down antibiotic use without any effect on the safety of animals.  That is important because if we think of the farm to fork strategy of the European Commission, it is seeking a 50% reduction in antimicrobial usage in farm animal production by 2030.  The Dutch, Danes, French, Germans and a number of other countries are dramatically reducing antimicrobial usage.  That has not happened here yet.  This is a critical factor for success in us being able to do this.<\/p> <p>  Before I pass to Ms McAloon to answer the other three questions, I will highlight why this is so important.  It is important because there are antibiotics being used in the dairy production sector in Ireland at the moment that are among the few alternative products left on the market for the treatment of severe sepsis and respiratory tract infection in people.  This issue of seeking to drive down antimicrobial usage in the food sector is important, both in legislation and from a moral point of view.<\/p><p>My colleague, Ms McAloon, will answer Deputy Fitzmaurice's other questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I will add a few points to Professor More's response to Deputy Carthy's original question.  On whether we can do it quickly, much can be achieved if we have an agreed motivation and a collaborative approach within the sector across all levels of industry.  On the regulation and change that will be required to the <i>status quo <\/i>in prescribing antimicrobials related to mastitis, there are certainly things we need to do, some more urgently than others.  There is currently a gulf between the legislation and the mindset among both vets and farmers and an understandable fear as we move away from blanket dry cow therapy.  Ultimately, there is a need to address communications and frame this legislation as positively as we can because the narrative around opportunities to improve our prudence in antimicrobial usage and in addressing quality to reduce the need for antimicrobials in the first place, provides us with a real opportunity to keep pace with our competitors.<br\/><br\/>During discussions in CellCheck we have looked at whether those things are achievable, such as a communications strategy that could be co-ordinated nationally in upskilling vets and farmers.  The targeted advisory service on animal health, TASAH, dry cow consults that CellCheck has implemented have been very successful as reported by vets and farmers alike, so the framework for some of this is already in place.  We are told that on increasing the need for milk recording, infrastructure could be put in place quite quickly.  There is certainly a positive opportunity there if the collaborative effort is agreed and the motivations are brought in line.<br\/><br\/>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for his questions.  I will elaborates on the issue of bringing us into line with Northern Ireland.  There are a couple of points on this.  Our industry is quite different in that it is manufacturing-based with milk supply contracts, milk going into infant formula and niche markets that are quite different from sales north of the border.  With that in mind, and trying to protect and promote the market we have in infant formula, there is a real need to move with best practice in antimicrobial usage and prescribing.  Ultimately, mastitis is quite farm-specific and the epidemiology of problems relating to mastitis is quite unique and specific to farms, which means we need bespoke solutions for them.  It is certainly possible to apply best practice and that is what we should strive to do in prudent antimicrobial use within the dairy sector here.  We need to push on and achieve that.  <br\/><br\/>On the question relating to cost, it is a very valid concern among farmers.  The overall point of this regulation is to reduce antimicrobial usage but also to move towards more prudent use.  Regardless of who sells the antimicrobial, the national goal is to reduce usage overall through a co-ordinated effort to improve milk quality and reduce the need for antimicrobials.  Mastitis is a very costly disease.  Teagasc has reported a difference of &euro;20,000 in farm profit between a bulk tank cell count of 100,000 compared to a bulk tank cell count of 400,000.  There are significant costs associated with individual mastitis cases and overall, if done properly and safely, reducing mastitis on farm and the need for antimicrobials, will be a cost benefit in the long run. <br\/><br\/>Ms McCoy may be able to add some further points on this, but the idea of where we can purchase drugs is not necessarily something we can comment on in terms of scientific best practice.  The Danes and the Dutch, who are both very successful in their quest to reduce antimicrobial usage in their dairy sectors, are operating different models.  From the scientific point of view, our focus will certainly be on bringing prescribing in line with best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McAloon"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I have one short additional question.

Ultimately, farmers and everybody on this committee are absolutely determined to ensure best practices.  We are very proud of our food production in this country and, indeed, farmers are very proud of it.  We are also very proud of our commitment and track record in animal health and welfare.  Unfortunately, if there is a cost factor and costs are driven up, the animal will suffer ultimately, which would be a retrograde step.<\/p> <p>  We have not touched on the risk of displacement in our rural communities.

However, it is important that Veterinary Ireland is aware of my preference, and the preference articulated by many of the farmers in my constituency, which is for a model similar to that available in some EU countries.

I would argue quite the contrary.  Our goal, and the aim in all that we do, is to support farmers to get the best outcomes.  The changes or opportunities we face include required change under legislation in how antibiotics are prescribed.  That will be required .  As an industry, what we can do collectively is support farmers through that transition because supports and help will be necessary.  There is also an opportunity as part of that, as outlined by Ms McAloon and Professor More, to improve milk quality overall.  That brings with it a financial gain.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about reducing the need for and, therefore, the use of antibiotics.  That comes with financial benefits.  We are also talking about improving efficiencies and overall mastitis control on farm.  That comes with financial opportunities and benefits.  Blanket dry cow therapy is the practice of giving all cows an antibiotic tube at the end of their lactation or at drying off.<\/p><p>For some of those cows it is a necessary treatment, but for the other cows, this is done just in case, and that just-in-case use of the antibiotic is no longer acceptable under new regulations.  From talking to farmers who have successfully moved away from what we refer to as blanket dry cow therapy, they are all extremely happy they have done so for various reasons, including cost savings, but also, and I do not think we should underestimate this, the ease of management and reduced stress levels of managing such a herd the following spring.  Whey they implement that change successfully with the correct supports from their service providers, it is a success and yields benefits in terms of costs.  I do not think we should assume this will cost more.

Do the witnesses not think there has been a complete lack of joined-up thinking when it has come to dealing with this issue?  We are talking about cell count in a farm setting.  One of the two things that have been mentioned is milk recording.  What have we done with milk recording in recent years?  We have put a VAT rate increase on it.  We have a very low percentage of farmers who take up milk recording, something like 40%, and although we are trying to increase that figure, we have decided to put a tax on the practice.  Where is the joined-up thinking in that scenario?  Milk recording is valuable to all farms, not alone for calculating cell count but for production and calculating the amount of solids all the way through the process.<\/p> <p>  On the available equipment, we talk about dry cow and mastitis but nobody talks about things like cluster flush.  If a person puts a cluster flush product into a milking parlour, it reduces the cell count at a dramatic rate because there is peracetic acid going through the unit every time before it goes to a cow.  As a dairy farmer who went through a problem this spring in my milking parlour, and trust me, I had black hair a few months ago, it is the most stressful period of a person's life trying to control it, and I had a wonderful vet who went through the entire milking process with me one evening because I thought I was going mad.  The lack of joined-up thinking in the entire Department in terms of what is required to reduce cell count is the most frustrating thing on the farmyard.  We should reduce the VAT rate on milk recording.  We should be talking about the peracetic acid and dipping cows so one cow does not transmit an infection to other cows.  That is where the big business is for me regarding trying to control the cell count issue.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the actual therapy required, the witnesses are right.  It is important we have the ability to dry cow tubes and-or a cow depending on what cow has what issue.  The only way to do that in many ways is to have milk recording, and we have gone the wrong way around that.  In fact, we have gone the other way.  If a person goes to a farm discussion group tomorrow morning, others at it will say their milk recording bill is going up and will ask if it is viable.  Have we any concept of what is happening on the farm itself?  Where is the joined-up thinking?  Because of that, we are losing the argument at the farm gate.  All the information packages in the world will not deliver it until we start talking about the infrastructure that is required.  I personally believe things like dipping clusters from one unit to the other is the key.  That is the ultimate.  It has not been mentioned here yet today.  If that is done, it actually reduces the cell count in the tank by up to 300,000 straight away, and I have experience of this.  It can go from 500,000, when there is a serious problem, down to 120,000-130,000 in a matter of days because the infection is actually limited.<\/p> <p>  That is the kind of conversation we need to have.  An awful lot of issues need to be thrashed out here.  We are only seeing a part of the debate here today.  I want to see a real campaign on milk recording, and the only way to do that is to do something about the price and to have a campaign on it.  The infrastructure, what is required on a farmyard regarding the milking parlour system, is probably the most important thing of all.

They may not be fair questions but I will put them to our guests anyway.  I feel and farmers feel they are over-regulated in this country.  Are we over-regulated?  Why do we always start with where it is going to affect the farmer?  Why did the organisations not start by taking on the vets who prescribe the medication for animals?  Why does it always have to be the farmer who has to pay the price?  Why do we always start at the bottom in this country and not at the top in bringing in regulations?  It reminds me that when it comes to Covid-19, every other illness does not matter now.  There is only one illness in this country that matters now and that is Covid.  People who are dying with cancer, who have mental health issues and every other kind of an issue do not seem to matter now.<\/p> <p>  Will there not now be a major monopoly with vets prescribing and selling at the same time?

I would expect to have more details on that. Were surveys carried out to see if this is possible?  Have the witnesses borne in mind that it may lead to medicines being sought illegally, which will lead to animal welfare issues?  Have the witnesses borne in mind that England has a good system?  I cannot see how we could be very different from England.  I find it hard to believe and I would like to see some reports or research on that which would show that clearly.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the points that have not been taken on board here by the representatives present, and I thank them for their presentations, any changes under this are going to lead to serious inconvenience for farmers.  If something is not broken, why fix it?  What is in place is working very well and farmers know their agri-merchants well.  While I support the need to reduce the use of antibiotics, I just find it hard to fathom that the representatives have not thought about the job losses.  We are already facing huge job losses with the pandemic and Brexit.  There is employment in rural communities where there would not be anything else other than the local agri-merchant, and 3,000 jobs are at stake here.  It is a system that is working well, and the witnesses say it is not going to work if we align with the North and their system.<\/p> <p>  I saw one farming organisation out today which has tens of thousands of members who are all farmers, to the best of my knowledge, and they seem to be very happy with it and are recommending we do this and align with the North, which is common sense.

I find that incredible.<\/p> <p>  We need to take on board that it is going to be a serious inconvenience for farmers.

That is the most important lesson we learned from the countries that have been able to move, namely, there is agreement and a common objective.  My colleague Ms McCoy will speak more on this.  We seek a host of things that are necessary to come from many directions towards a common objective.  We highlight in the paper some of the past decisions which have made it more difficult for us.  One third of dairy farms - about 5,000 - will really struggle with the shift to selected dry cow therapy because they do not have mastitis under the level of control needed.  We could greatly benefit from Bord Bia providing an impetus to support the move towards lower cell counts.  Similarly, the date adjustment and the interpretation currently used, which I outlined in the paper, mean that it is possible for farmers to continue to supply even if they have a serious problem.  They are things that need to be addressed.  I agree with the Senator on all the points he raised.<\/p> <p>  On cluster flushing, the fundamental requirement is a very detailed investigation of the problem, as the Senator spoke of, to ensure that any recommended actions will actually address the drivers of the problem.  Also there must be very detailed discussion, as there was in the Senator's case, between the farmer and the investigating veterinarian to agree a plan that is workable and is associated subsequently with review.  We would support milk recording.  We have a fundamental issue now, as the Senator highlighted, as we shift towards selective dry cow therapy.  We need individual cow information.  We need to know which cow needs to be treated based on evidence of infection.  The simplest and most effective way to do that is through milk recording.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Ring spoke about over-regulation.  Again, it very much highlights the need for a multi-pronged approach, which is what Senator Lombard spoke of.  It most certainly does not focus solely on what farmers need to do.  There is a whole host of different actions that are important.  Many relate to farmers but many do not.  <\/p> <p>  I will pick up on three of the points raised by Deputy Nolan and my colleagues will respond to others.  On alignment with the North, obviously it is important to work very closely with our Northern neighbours.  We are governed by EU regulation which is what is driving what is happening at the moment.  On 28 January 2022, we will need to be aligned with the new veterinary medicines regulation.  On serious inconvenience to farmers, the key driver is antimicrobial resistance which is one of the key global issues we will increasingly face in coming years.  What we see with Covid now is what we may potentially see with antimicrobial resistance unless we are able to take the actions that are necessary now.  Otherwise, we will end up in an era where we no longer have any effective antimicrobials.  Deputy Nolan spoke of things we should do.  We are very much seeking to provide the committee with as best an understanding as we have of science-based information.  Our whole purpose is to hopefully inform the committee about the science.  We appreciate that science is only one of the components in the decision-making process, we fully understand that, but we hope that we are able to provide science-based information to help support it in as clear a way as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>To respond to Senator Lombard, there can be unanimous agreement on the need for milk recording. That has been shown in other countries which have moved towards selected dry cow therapy where it is a mainstay.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on who will pay for it but it is something that must be done.  We are operating at about 50% of the national herd represented by milk recording and the larger farms are over-represented in that.  In a recent Teagasc survey among farmers to understand the barriers to milk recording, cost and time were mentioned least.  Infrastructure, supports and not understanding its benefits were the reasons they did not engage in it.  In addition to having a meaningful campaign around the issue and joined-up thinking, we need to be unanimous on the message of milk recording, delivered by whatever means are necessary.<\/p> <p>  On the cluster flush, as someone who does a lot of mastitis investigations, and I regularly recommend it, I am pleased to hear about the engagement in understanding the epidemiology of the farm problem and the meaning for change that was turned out as a result.  It is a fundamental principle that must be adhered to in delivering this regulation.  It is about tackling those problems in a bespoke manner that focuses on the individual farm so that change can be achieved.  <\/p> <p>  A meaningful campaign and joined-up thinking are essential, along with a collaborative approach in the industry so that we get the communication right.  There is a fear among farmers about the move away from blanket dry cow therapy.  For years, we advised that was the correct thing to do and now, since we understand antimicrobial resistance, we are moving away from that.  It requires a monumental sea change in opinion to do this.  Even for things such as milk recording, our survey data shows that the understanding of the link between milk recording and antimicrobial resistance is not there at farm level, that milk recording is a necessity in figuring out what cows to treat and which cows are safe to use an alternative such as a teat sealant.  A campaign on this and getting the communication right is a necessity.  The motivation should not be solely regulation, it is an approach and requirement that is necessary to address the global public health threat of antimicrobial resistance which in no other time has been so well understood by the public and consumer, given the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Ring's points on regulation, there is scientific evidence that supports the need to move away from blanket dry cow therapy and overhaul our approach to antibiotic use in agriculture.  There are also societal pressures.  This discussion is coming from the legislative pressure that is there and has put a timeline on it.  Yes, the regulation will be difficult and a challenge but ultimately it is a huge opportunity to improve milk quality and up our game in that and to improve our use of antimicrobial stewardship as an industry.  That is something which we can promote internationally as part of our brand.  There is a significant responsibility on vets as well as farmers to deliver this properly.  There will have to be upskilling among vets and industry-wide so that everyone is brought into line and up to scratch to deliver this safely.  Benchmarking antimicrobial usage at farmer user and prescriber level usage has been key to the success of the delivery of this internationally.<\/p><p>The idea on benchmarking and whether it will leave us open to an independent audit will be key to ensuring there will not be over-prescribing regarding the issues raised.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Nolan for her comments.  I have a couple of points to make.  In terms of the North and the UK system, there are some significant differences.  Recent figures indicate about 70% of UK herds engage in milk recording.  Their pathogen and profile of mastitis is largely not contagious mastitis, which is what we deal with in Ireland, and which makes dry cow decisions quite different.  In addition, there are certain milk supply contracts in the UK in which milk recording and engaging in selective dry cow therapy is something which must be done to sell the milk out the farm gate.  It is a condition of supply.  Ultimately, the issue of prescribing by a vet is largely similar.  In terms of those few changes, we need to be aware we are not necessarily always comparing like with like.<\/p><p> On the final comment made by Deputy Nolan, and I again thank her for her contribution, the key for us is changing the approach to prescribing and prudent usage of antimicrobials which if done properly can only be a positive for the sector.

I thank the witnesses for their statement which is clear and concise.  There is one point I would like to highlight before I hand over to other members of the committee.  It reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCritically important antibiotics need to be controlled and preserved [I think we would all agree with that], this is best achieved by [the] reclassification as <i>Veterinary Practitioner Only <\/i>medicines. Therefore, these drugs could only be administered directly by a veterinary surgeon, where the need arises.  This would drastically reduce usage and misuse of surplus antibiotics on animals not intended to be treated. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a very strong statement. In practice on farms, farmers have an awful lot of work to do in husbandry of the animals.  The buck starts and stops with the farmer as regard the health of the animals.  In practical terms, one might have an animal, for example, a Friesian bull calf, a lamb or a ewe, the value of which is X but significantly below a call-out fee.  I am not questioning the call-out fee of the vet because any professional person needs to be paid.  In order to ensure proper animal welfare standards and to ensure an animal gets treated when it needs to, surely that point in practice is not practical in animal terms.  I am strongly of the view that a farmer will only use an antibiotic when it is absolutely necessary.  Obviously, I would say that it has to be done under veterinary supervision but to state that financially we can bring a vet out to every animal that is sick on the farm cannot work in practice.  I am seriously concerned that if this is enforced rigidly, one would have animal welfare issues on farms and none of us want to encounter that.  How do the witnesses think this would work in practice?  I accept fully that vets give a great service to farmers in rural Ireland but in economic and animal welfare terms, how could that work in practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#G00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  Critically important antibiotics are a subset of antibiotics.  They are not all antibiotics.  Through the Irish National Action Plan, INAP,  which is the stakeholder group that looks at antimicrobial resistance, we have agreed across industry these highest-priority critically-important antibiotics are used only in second-line treatments and in some cases only after a culture and sensitivity test is carried out.  It is our view this is not practical, in that if one has treated an animal and left some of the antibiotics there is a temptation for those antibiotics to be used as first-line treatments.  Ultimately, they would have been prescribed for another animal and it leads to a situation which, essentially, cannot be policed.  If we really want to reduce the use of these highest-priority critically-important antibiotics - these are three separate categories of antibiotics which are vital for human health so much so that they are the last line of defence in hospitals for treating human patients - they should be taken out of general circulation and only used for severely sick animals where there is no other option.  It might be a misunderstanding.

One of the main reasons for the change in antiparasitics is development of resistance has been established.  What does resistance to anthelmintic mean for a dairy, beef or sheep farmer?  It means the drugs we traditionally use get benefit from the use of grassland pasture management to grow our cattle no longer work against parasites.  It is a natural occurrence in these drugs but it is driven by overuse.  These drugs are used more frequently than they need to be and at the incorrect time and dosage.<\/p> <p>  The knock on effect is these parasites which cause welfare and performance losses in cattle and sheep are not killed off as effectively as before.  Calf rearing units see significant resistance to some of the main drugs categories for stomach worms.  This has a huge impact on performance and animal welfare.  <\/p> <p>  Some farms are now limited in what drugs will work which drives cost because the choice of drugs available is limited and they are often restricted to the few newer drugs.  The level of production they can achieve is reduced and feed and conversion efficiency is reduced and the animals do not thrive.  Animals not being able to thrive is a major cost to farms.  We address this by using the right dose at the right time and when necessary.<\/p> <p>  Fecal egg counts have been bandied about.  It is a useful test practitioners use on a regular basis to establish a parasite burden on a farm or in an animal but it is not without limitations.  It does not detect prepatent infection which is infection before the eggs are laid.  Nematodirus in sheep is a major issue.  Hoose lungworm infection in cattle will not be detected until it is too late in terms of a fecal egg count.  We embrace these tests.  They are a string in our bow in the treatment and management of parasites on a farm but they are not the gold standard.  It would be foolish and dangerous to rely on the interpretation of fecal egg counts when prescribing anthelmintics.<\/p> <p>  Veterinary practitioners need their farm clients to be profitable.  How does veterinary intervention bring value to a farm?  The recently implemented CellCheck programme is a good example.  The main point of carrying out dry cow consults is to reduce the amount of antibiotics used and to move away from blanket dry cow therapy.  There is an initial key saving for the farmer in that he is not purchasing unnecessary antibiotics.  These consults are to reduce antibiotics but also to consider the reasons for using them.  <\/p> <p>  Antibiotics are used to treat a disease.  We consider why the antibiotics are being used rather than considering the supply routes and who prescribes them.  Vets see why the diseases are on farms when they visit and what can be done to negate the risk, therefore reducing the need for antibiotics.  CellCheck is a good example of how vets going on to farms can reduce cost and improve productivity.<\/p> <p>  Knowledge transfer is another programme which was run in recent years.  A recent paper which considered its results showed how sheep mortality decreased following this programme.  Farm outputs were improved and overall costs were reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I ask that the witnesses introduce themselves, so the secretariat has their names for the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#H00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank our guests and reiterate the Chair's thanks for the work vets do across the country alongside our farming community.  As Deputy Kehoe said, I am sure the witnesses are aware that some interpret the witnesses' position on the EU regulation on veterinary medical products as a money grabbing exercise to concentrate wealth in the hands of vets at the expense of the licensed merchants and other responsible persons.<\/p> <p>  I previously raised a point that there was a clear distinction in human medicine between the person prescribing the medicine and the person buying it.  The medicine is prescribed by a GP and purchased in a pharmacy.  The separation of prescribing and dispensing of veterinary medicines has been advocated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Chief Veterinary Officer, CVO.  Does Veterinary Ireland deem it a suitable way to proceed to ensure its members are not overburdened, the licensed merchants remain viable, as an important asset to many rural communities, and in terms of the health benefits I previously mentioned?  <\/p> <p>  Veterinary Ireland made a bold statement in its statement that Ireland was fortunate in that every farm had access to a vet 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  It is not universally true.  The witnesses will be aware of issues that arose when Donegal Animal Hospital moved into lay ownership.  Veterinary Ireland called for the Department to investigate the operation of the practice.  Is it fair to say that a farm does not always have access to a vet at all times?<\/p> <p>  Veterinary Ireland's statement said that antiparasitic resistance represented a clear and present danger, with which I agree.  The danger it presents to the Irish agrifood industry was mentioned.  Veterinary Ireland will be aware that the industry operates on an all-Ireland basis but there is a divergence North and South.  Following the implementation of the regulation, that divergence will be at 90 degrees and present a sustained threat and challenge.  Do the witnesses have a proposal on how we address that while recognising that it does not appear likely the British will move towards the EU system in the short term?<\/p> <p>  Zolvix is a new product available on prescription from licensed merchants.  It is a vital tool in reducing sheep worm resistance.  Take up by many vets in prescribing of the product seems to have been poor.

I will deal with the issue of the decoupling of prescribing and dispensing in the context of the human health service.  We do not believe the decoupling of prescribing and dispensing veterinary medicines would benefit the agricultural industry or lead to a reduction in antimicrobial usage.  The implementation of such a proposal would have a number of negative impacts.<\/p><p>It would decrease competition in the sale of veterinary medicines.  It would unfairly exclude veterinary practitioners from the veterinary medicine market, within which there is strong competition.  It would reduce the element of choice and convenience for the consumer.  It would be detrimental to animal health and welfare.  Currently, there is no economic basis for clinical work in large animal practice.  We do not want to see the cost of clinical veterinary services giving rise to animal welfare issues.  It would threaten the viability of rural veterinary practices.  The sale of drugs is one service area which gives rise to an income stream to support veterinary practices.  Private veterinary practitioners operate without any State subsidy.  There is no subsidy available for the employment of vets, for computerisation, for practice staff such as veterinary or administrative support staff, or for professional indemnity or practice premises.<\/p><p> One can contrast this with the supports available to maintain GP services in rural areas.  The State subsidises the provision of this service to the tune of approximately &euro;120,000 per GP per annum.  In-direct subsidies through the payment of a rural practice allowance are valued at &euro;20,000.  The allowances for the employment of practice secretaries, nurses and practice managers amount to &euro;93,000.  In addition to this, there is a 95% reimbursement of medical indemnity costs.  Ultimately, decoupling will leave some of the most isolated farms in rural Ireland without veterinary services.  Any policy decision to take away the dispensing of veterinary medicine from veterinary practitioners would lead to a loss of veterinary and veterinary support staff from veterinary practices, which are of significant value to rural areas and local economies.  Our policy choices need to support the veterinary infrastructure footprint nationwide and not reduce it.<\/p><p> Between vets and support staff, there are about 6,000 people employed in veterinary practices.  Furthermore, experience has shown in EU member states where veterinarians are not allowed to dispense veterinary medicines, this did not lead to reduced use or reduced sales.  Neither did it lead to a lower frequency of antimicrobial resistance.  The Berenschot report ordered by the Dutch ministry examined in detail the effects of decoupling prescriptions and sale of veterinary medicinal products by veterinarians.  It concluded restricting the sale of antimicrobials by veterinarians would not be effective.  On the contrary, it recommended strengthening the position of the veterinarian as gatekeeper for antimicrobial use in animals.<\/p><p> It is the view of both Veterinary Ireland and the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe that separating the veterinary prescribing of antimicrobials from the right to dispense antimicrobials is not the solution to combating antimicrobial resistance.  The human health model of when the doctor prescribes and the pharmacist dispenses medicines was mentioned earlier.  We need to be aware the human health model is a very costly model versus what exists under the animal health model.  The State spends more than &euro;3 billion a year in the cost of drugs for General Medical Services, GMS, patients and reimbursements under the drug payment and long-term illness schemes.  It buys coverage for 53% of the population.  GPs are directly reimbursed in excess of &euro;600 million a year in fees and allowances in respect of medical card patients, including &euro;160 million in allowances for the employment of support staff.  Pharmacists receive &euro;400 million per annum in fees.  That amounts to in excess of &euro;1 billion in State support for GPs and pharmacists.  Therefore, it is important stakeholders recognise the veterinary service is provided in a very lean and efficient manner.  Changing the model would ultimately make the provision of veterinary services more expensive while reducing the service for farmers and the public.<\/p><p> Deputy Carthy commented on our claim that vets are available in every parish in the country, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  I concede there may be local areas where issues arise occasionally.  The issue he referred to in County Donegal arose in the context of a lay corporate purchasing and closing down of a practice, and the vets did not really have a say in it.  By and large, we are fortunate to have extensive coverage of veterinary practitioners in every parish in the country.  We have approximately 1,000 vets employed in food animal practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>There are many other question for the witnesses to answer so we will move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#J00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the antiparasitic dosing stuff, to put it simply, and the farmer who gets it in a place other than a veterinary practice.

Are the witnesses saying VI will give out prescriptions for free?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses talk about the vets around the country.  We are lucky with the number of vets in our area and they are good, which is something I have always said.  They have spoken about the viability of vets and it is very important to keep them in one's area - I would be the first person to say that - but is it at a cost of losing someone in the co-operative or someone who is administering it?  Would it not be a better ploy if the vets came out in support of the fact that we need a licensed person who has gone through courses in order that they can give out the dosing stuff?  I am not talking about injections for mastitis or whatever; I am talking about antiparasitic medicines.<\/p> <p>  The farmers in Northern Ireland are trusted to give antiparasitic medicine to their cattle.  There is the equivalent of a responsible person or a chemist.  Going by what VI has said, is the thinking that the farmer here is not as sharp as the farmer in Northern Ireland?  Is it not better that we, Veterinary Ireland and qualified persons, work on this together?  There is plenty of work for them all.  To be frank, I do not want to see anyone losing out on this.  To be blunt, if vets have a hold on prescriptions, they will have a hold on the whole thing and it will be anticompetitive.  As politicians, we will then have to go down a road to fight for a situation like the doctors have by putting a separate gap between it.  I will say one thing about the doctors.

The prescription is the result of a service.  It is an outcome.  The outcome to the service might be no prescription, if no dosing stuff is required.  The system at the moment is that anthelmintics, dosing stuff, and other products for lice and mange etc. are non-prescription medicines.  A farmer can decide what to use, when to use, and how often to use it.  These products had been prescription-only under regulations dating back to 2005.  We have seen since 2007, a derogation in Ireland because there was no resistance in 2005 and that was allowed ride until the HPRA, rather than Veterinary Ireland, decided it was no longer possible to enact that derogation.  There have been many published studies by the Department and Teagasc on the rise of anthelmintic resistance in Ireland, which we are seeing on the ground as Mr. Gavin mentioned earlier.<\/p> <p>  The idea of bringing them in as prescription-only products is not to allow vets to sell them.  It is to ensure that before a farmer makes a parasite control plan or decision on his or her farm, he or she will converse with his or her vet and look at the best approach to control parasites.  This may not only be through the use of chemicals.  It may be through pasture management, delaying treatment or targeted treatment, or treating a subset of the population to minimise the effect of this resistance, which is growing.<\/p><p>This can be done in many guises.  The idea is to get away from a farmer deciding on a Saturday morning to dose cattle that day but rather to take a more planned approach that can be discussed with the vet in advance.  Out of this service we envisage a prescription would be furnished.  I am not saying the service would be free but I do not believe the prescription is a red tape service that will just attract a fee without any of the other aspects also.<\/p><p> As a result of this, we will have less product used and better bang for our buck.  We have countless examples of money being wasted on these products at wrong times or for the wrong disease.  We will also get better thriving.  Overall, if we embrace this properly, vets can help farmers make better decisions.  As it is today, these products will be available for sale in all of the outlets where they are available at present.  It will be a conversation for each farmer and his or her vet.

Last Saturday morning, I had the opportunity to be in one of the wholesalers that under the current regulations can sell these products.  I was shown products which have come online in recent weeks, which now state on the packaging they will be prescription only medicines.  Even though the legislation has not changed, the packaging for these products has already changed.  Companies have assumed the legislation is coming on board and are packaging the products for it.  We need to talk about this.  They have moved ahead of us and have said what is happening here is null and void and the change will happen anyway, and the companies are packaging appropriately.  Have the witnesses come across this?  I came across it last Saturday morning.<\/p> <p>  The debate we are having on resistance is very important.  We have to clarify what is happening in the dairy industry itself.  The vaccination programmes in the dairy industry for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhoea and leptospirosis have greatly reduced the use of antibiotics throughout the industry because of their effectiveness.  We need to acknowledge the major work we have done in this regard when we are having this debate.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues I have heard is that we need to look at dates when dosing will take place and the weights and amount per animal.  Will we have a vet in the yard telling us an animal is 600 kg?  Is this a practical solution to what we are proposing?  I realise a plan could be put in place whereby we could have a pasture management plan of rotating animals in front of bigger stock.  When it comes to the practical implications of what is being proposed with regard to the weight of animals and the amount per dose, are we saying a vet could have a better handle than a farmer on judging the weight of an animal?  Will we be weighing every animal in the crush for the dose?  This issue needs to be thought out with regard to how we will deliver it on the ground.<\/p> <p>  What happens if this fails?  What happens in five years' time if the microresistance project we are embarking on totally fails?  What is plan B?  What will the Veterinary Council of Ireland propose?

That is not the way a prescription works.  If we prescribe something, we are prescribing a product that is required.

We have farms at present where plan A has failed.  I certainly have them in my practice, as does Mr. Gavin and as do vets throughout the country.  It is more common in cattle-rearing farms, as Mr. Gavin has said, and on sheep farms.  Plan B has already been implemented.  It means we cannot rely on chemical control of parasites on these farms and we have to implement grazing management plans, whereby the top end of the sward is grazed with smaller animals and the pastures are grazed out with older immune animals.  It means farmers have to fence off some areas, for example for fluke, where sheep or cattle cannot be put.  It means instead of closing 60% of a farm for silage, the farmer takes paddocks so the same paddocks are not grazed ten or 11 times a year, because the parasite build-up is too high.  There are all sorts of ways of tackling it if it happens.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt we have resistance.  Resistance is not just there because a product was used with or without a prescription.  Resistance is there because the product is used.  When a product is used on a population of parasites, it will kill 90%, 95% or 99% of those parasites but the percentage that is left will multiply and eventually will become the dominant group.  If the same product is always used, they will become resistant and that is how it works.  It is about strategies.<\/p> <p>  This is part of a strategy that is already there.  Having veterinary advice will remove the temptation to use the more convenient product, which has meant some farmers using the same product on cattle for years and years because it is pour on and handy, or perhaps they have used products where they are not necessary, for example, on sheep farms where all the ewes are dosed every time the lambs are dosed, which is not necessary, or lambs being dosed early in springtime before there is any need to do so, which is not necessary.  All of these represent a build-up of resistance.  There is also a potential cost saving to farmers because they do not need to use these products.  I hope this answers the Senator's question.  It is not all or nothing.  We are living with this on a small percentage of farms at present and we are hoping that by instituting change, which we did not ask for but it is our duty to uphold, we can slow this down and perhaps even reverse it on the majority of farms in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Geraghty"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presence.  I am fortunate enough to benefit from the great service the vets provide daily and hourly in my area.  Unfortunately, in my role here today the praise has to end there and I must be slightly critical.<\/p><p>I would have to be slightly critical based on the Veterinary Ireland submission, which I would like to quote.  This is our third meeting on this issue and we have focused mainly on antiparasitic resistance and the need, under the EU regulations, for these to become prescription-only medicines.  The submission, at No. 4, page 5, states:<\/p><blockquote>\tAnti-parasitic medicinal products are a precious resource that must be used only when necessary to preserve their efficacy and ensuring that pasture based livestock production can continue.  They cannot be used to attract customers to co-op and merchant stores to sell non-medicinal commodities such as fencing materials and silage plastic.  This is not prudent practice and has ultimately led us to the position we find ourselves at present. <\/blockquote><p>That is a very strong statement and one that needs clarification here today.  Without going back to quote other sections of the submission, while I have been reading this for political purposes as a politician, I am a farmer, ultimately.  It is like learning a second language in that people will always think in their first one.  Therefore, I was reading this as a farmer and I noticed some other passages within the presentation.  The last page of the submission states, &quot;The removal of any income stream from farm animal veterinary practice will render a proportion of the practices unviable and reduce service and competition in the area.&quot;  As a farmer, I feel that is very accusing of farmers, responsible persons, licensed merchants and pharmacists in what is said, namely, we are where we are because of their recklessness.  I find that a very disparaging and condescending statement.<br\/><br\/>I have three questions based on what I have read out.  Will the witnesses clarify why they went down that road and why they seem to have turned this into an &quot;us and them&quot; issue?  It is seen as more of a market share issue than what is our priority here, which is, first, the animal, and second and third, in no particular order, the consumer and the farmer.  Veterinary Ireland has very much turned this into an issue of market share and an &quot;us and them&quot; issue, even in regard to its customers, the farmers.  Will the witnesses comment?<br\/><br\/>With regard to the issue of making antiparasitics prescription-only medicines, will the witnesses comment on the fact antimicrobial medicines have been prescription only for more than 30 years, yet antimicrobial resistance has grown immensely within both animals and humans?  In the opinion of the witnesses, why will changing the regulation to do the same thing with antiparasitic medicines have any positive effect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#K00700","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Who wants to deal with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#L00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I will deal with it.  I would not agree with Senator Daly's interpretation that our present submission has been about market share or has not been about resistance.  Certainly, we would never get into an &quot;us and them&quot; situation.  As a veterinary representative organisation, we sit on all the stakeholder groups in the country, from the Animal Health Ireland ones to the antiparasitic resistance stakeholder group, and we have never been found wanting in putting our shoulder to the wheel to push for change and consensus within those groups.  Anyone who sits on those groups will concur with that.<br\/><br\/>Second, with regard to the difference between prescription-only medicines and a licensed merchant product, a product is labelled LM, for licensed merchant, or POM, for prescription-only medicine.  One cannot advertise, discount, offer on sale or use as a promotional product any product that is POM.  If anyone picks up the pages of the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal<\/i>, the <i>Farming Independent<\/i>or whatever other newspaper they read as a farmer, they will not see advertisements for POM products on the page because that is illegal.  These are to be used prudently and not to be advertised to encourage people to use them.  That is one of the key differences between antiparasitic products that are POM or non-POM.<br\/><br\/>Third, with regard to antimicrobials, the Senator is correct that antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem. This was highlighted by the man who invented antimicrobials, Mr. Fleming, in that, when he got the Nobel prize for the discovery of penicillin, he said that as soon as it is used, resistance will develop.  The more any of these products are used, the more resistance will develop.<br\/><br\/>The other problem with resistance in antimicrobials is that this resistance is not alone in an individual animal or human, it is also in the environment, and bacteria with the resistance gene can infect other bacteria.  Where, for example, waste is coming into the environment from hospitals, that can make its way into agriculture and, <i>vice versa<\/i>, where resistance is developing in agriculture, it will find its way to humans.<br\/><br\/>Prescription-only medicines are not going to limit resistance.  We have to change the way we use these products.  For the past 20 years, we have seen this both in human and veterinary medicine.  There have been huge advertising campaigns over the past two decades with regard to human medicines to tell people that if they have flu, they do not need an antibiotic, and these campaigns have been quite public.<br\/><br\/>Over the same period, as Senator Lombard pointed out, the amount of vaccine or preventative medicine being used by farmers in this country, which was driven by the veterinary profession given these herd health plans were driven by vets, has increased by over 200%.  If we look back at our usage of antimicrobials from 2010 to now, it was quite steady as an industry all during that period until the last report, which showed it has reduced.  During that time, we have had a massive increase in our national herd, for example, and we have gone through dairy expansion.  Despite an ever-increasing pressure on the system, therefore, we have managed to, at worst, keep it steady and, recently, make gains and reduce it.  I know some looking at the previous figures would like to see a bigger reduction but the fact we have increased vaccination rates, engaged with farmers on herd health and maintained the steady or declining use of antimicrobials is testament to the efforts of veterinary practitioners and farmers in the country working together, which is what we do, to help reduce animal disease.<br\/><br\/>To reiterate the point on anthelmintic resistance, it is not about an &quot;us and them&quot;.  To address something that was missed on Deputy Carthy's question about Zolvix, the reason Zolvix was not used is because it was treated by the veterinary profession as a precious resource only to be used as a last resort, where it was needed for that tiny percentage of farms that could not use anything else.  Given the fact we were not using enough, the company did not find it viable to keep selling it and we perhaps have supply issues as a result.  It is typical of how serious the veterinary profession was about this last anthelmintic dose that it was only to be used where there was nothing else to use.  That is why it was not used in huge quantities.  It was preserved so we would not have resistance to that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021032300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Geraghty"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Is there any appetite among the experts to return to the previous regime, with proper training?

The first is to do with antimicrobials, or antibiotics as we would know them, and the second concerns antiparasitics, which is an Irish issue because we have obtained a derogation for these being prescription only up to now.<\/p> <p>  I will start with antibiotics.  I might be very simplistic on this because it is a huge legislative measure.  The main change is that we can no longer rely on antibiotics as a preventative.  We can only used them on sick animals.  The previous speakers were talking solely about mastitis and blanket dry cow therapy but that applies to all sorts of things.  It applies to blanket treating animals bought in in case they get pneumonia, for example.  It applies to using CTC powder for calves that might get cough and to blanket treatment for watery mouth in lambs at birth.  All these practices will no longer be allowed.  That is one simple thing.<\/p> <p>  The second major one is the possible restrictions on critically important antibiotics.  We may not have access to all of them in the agrifood sector.  There will certainly be restrictions on them and maybe a requirement on vets to have evidence that they are the only prudent thing to prescribe in certain cases.  In other words, one would not be allowed to use them without a culture and sensitivity test first to say these are the only ones that can be used.<\/p> <p>  On antiparasitics, the big change for Ireland is that, rather than being licensed merchant, LM, products available in co-operatives, licensed merchants, pharmacists and vets, they will still be available in all those outlets but will only be able to be dispensed on foot of a veterinary prescription.

He knows the size of farms, especially in the west and north-west of Ireland.  If that starts, the big guy with 300 or 400 cows will always be the winner because he will have buying power.

I take up the point Senator Paul Daly made on the Veterinary Ireland claim in its submission that the use of medicines to attract other sales of non-medicinal products has led to the establishment of antiparasitic resistance.  The language there is quite accusatory and divisive and I am concerned.  It is not true because earlier in the submission, it is stated that the development of resistance is an evolving process which increases every time these types of medicines are use.  I would like to get the witnesses' response on this.  I feel it is unnecessarily divisive and the tone is wrong.<\/p> <p>  There is acceptance among stakeholders that these veterinary medicines will need to become prescription medicines and that addressing resistance is an absolute priority but the HPRA and the chief veterinary officer insist on a multi-stakeholder approach.  Will Veterinary Ireland engage to create a specifically focused prescription that all parties can issue, which would be a way of ensuring a multi-stakeholder approach?  I hope that happens and we do not have a situation where a monopoly is set up and other businesses cut.

When the products become prescription only, they cannot be advertised so there will not be a marketing edge to the sale of these products.<\/p> <p>  On the prescription, that is an act of veterinary medicine and it is not just based on one simple facet but on a three-pronged approach of test data, clinical examination and on-farm risk assessment.<\/p><p>Those three parameters are used to decide whether a prescription is necessary.

We are a member of the antiparasitic resistance stakeholder group and have committed to that.  We have also been very engaged with iNAP, which has been operating for longer.  We have taken part in, and led, some of the changes and some of the farmer guidelines that have emerged from that.  There is no question that Veterinary Ireland will engage.<br\/><br\/>To respond to Deputy Fitzmaurice, there will always be individuals who try to gain a commercial edge in any sector.  It is not limited to the veterinary sector but there is a good deal of competition within the sector at the moment.  Some of the products we deal with have the tightest margins of any prescription-only medicine products.  I am sure some of the committee members from the south will concur with that.  Products such as Bovivac S and Rotavec Corona are very tightly priced and are prescription only.<br\/><br\/>Farmers can choose their vet and can change their choice every day if they wish, especially in the area of the country where the Deputy and I come from, where there is ample choice.  Farmers will work with vets who help them manage their livestock and provide them with a service, and this will be just another part of that service.  In fairness, our discussion about market shares shows that the majority of farmers are already using their vets to engage, to be advised and to make the correct choices on farms.  They also buy some of that product at other locations such as co-operatives or licensed merchants.<br\/><br\/>All in all, in the common model that exists on the ground, there is no divisiveness between farmers and vets.  Farmers and vets, especially at this time of the year, depend on each other and are in regular contact.  There is a difference between this part of the island and the other side of the Border.  We as an agrifood industry in the Republic depend on exporting 90% of our food to third markets, whether Russia, China, South Korea or the US, to survive.  Farmers in the North have the English population to feed, so they are not as heavily dependent on exports.  When food is being exported, reputation is key.  We have a more stringent regulatory system here.  It is common knowledge, and has been highlighted recently by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>, that there is a more lax system in the North.  The Irish name, when we engage in trade missions and or when food audits come here from third countries, is worth an awful lot because we are probably a bit more heavily regulated than some countries that do not depend on exports.

In the past ten years, I have worked on assessing the impact of transport on the environment and on developing policy measures that help increase transport's sustainability.  The International Transport Forum, ITF, at the OECD is a global transport policy think-tank with over 62 member countries.  The ITF&rsquo;s decarbonising transport initiative aims to help policymakers make the right decisions to meet their climate ambitions, based on quantitative evidence.  We are very grateful for our co-operation with our member country Ireland, which has held the ITF's presidency for the past two years.  Collaborating with representatives from Ireland has allowed us to produce innovative and insightful work for the greater Dublin area and beyond.  In what follows, I rely on much of this work to ensure my intervention is as Ireland-specific as possible for a representative from an intergovernmental organisation.  I am focusing on passenger transport, as I believe one of today's other witnesses will perfectly cover considerations regarding freight transport.<br\/><br\/>The committee&rsquo;s aim to take action in line with the &quot;avoid-shift-improve&quot; framework is laudable.  Following this framework allows for the development of a sustainable transport system that is equitable, accessible and safe, and which drives economic productivity and has limited environmental impacts.  Deep emissions cuts will require true transformations.  They will require embracing innovations and potential disruptions, and they will likely require taking risks and taking decisions under uncertainty.  To mitigate any risks and reduce uncertainty, evidence-based, holistic and long-term planning, based on quantitative evidence, best practice and scenario analysis, is required.  It is essential to start now to look beyond 2030 and even beyond 2050 to avoid missing relevant actions today that will have essential impacts in the future.<br\/><br\/>Measures in the avoid category will help decouple economic growth from increases in transport demand.  Land use measures that encourage compact developments and the redevelopment of local centres in line with the concept of the 15-minute city are essential to reduce travel distances and to encourage shifts to more sustainable modes.  The pandemic will also provide the opportunity to encourage teleworking.  However, teleworking practices under non-pandemic circumstances are likely to have rebound effects.  People will increase their travel activity during their leisure time.<br\/><br\/>This is where the importance of shift measures becomes even more apparent.  Individual motorised mobility needs to shift to active modes or to shared and efficient motorised modes, where required.  These may be the classic public transport modes.  However, transport innovations can and should play a significant role as well.  ITF research for the greater Dublin area has shown that if 20% of private car trips were replaced with shared mobility on-demand modes, emissions would fall by more than 20%.  These reductions do not assume that shared vehicles may be electric, which by now would be a feasible option as well.  A transport system based on such shared mobility can decarbonise transport while promoting a truly sustainable transport system, including the use of existing bus and rail networks.  Another ITF study shows that if 20% of car users were to shift to shared services, mobility demand would require 40% less street space.  This space could be used for active modes or green spaces, greatly enhancing the liveability of the city.  The deployment and uptake of such innovations need to be encouraged by sufficient financial and regulatory supports.  Measures can include congestion charging, low emission zones, dynamic parking pricing, the phase-out of subsidised parking and so forth.  When implementing such measures, it must first be ensured that adequate travel alternatives exist.<br\/><br\/>Improve measures comprise instruments that improve the use of fuels, the efficiency of vehicles and the performance of related infrastructure.  In Europe and elsewhere, electricity has been gaining ground as the alternative energy carrier to fossil fuels in transport.  In addition, smaller, lighter vehicles, electric or not, will always outperform their heavier, larger counterparts.  People should be encouraged to use the right size of vehicle at all times.  This brings us back to the concept of vehicle sharing.<\/p><p>In this case, it is about ensuring that vehicle rental systems allow for renting a vehicle of the right size, be it for an urban trip or a holiday trip for several weeks.<\/p><p> Reaping benefits from avoid-and-shift measures will take time.  This has two main implications for policymakers.  First, they need to move fast on these measures to get them under way.  Second, relying on the uptake of electric vehicles will be unavoidable if Ireland is to achieve 2030 targets.  However, it is advisable to do this smartly.  This means it is necessary to: encourage the uptake of full electric vehicles and avoid long transition periods via hybrid alternatives; ensure that additional electricity demands are fully covered by renewable energy sources; deploy electric vehicles where they are most useful and where more sustainable alternatives do not exist - for example, in public fleets and in non-urban areas; speed up the uptake of electric vehicles, in line with the conditions just mentioned, via well-targeted fiscal measures and the provision of infrastructure; and, finally, consider the fuel tax shortfall that countries with high electric vehicle uptake would face and prepare for it accordingly.<\/p><p> I will say a word about the people.  Mobility choices are individual choices.  The challenge that lies ahead will require behavioural changes by each of us.  It will require people to reassess and change their habits, and maybe even their way of life.  Some may even be required to accept higher expenditure - in time or money - on their mobility needs, at least in the short run.  Such changes will not be easy.  Nobody should therefore diminish the importance of bringing people from all walks of life on board, including the effort this will take.  It will require communicating the importance and, yes, the urgency of climate action, as well as the relevance of individual behaviour.  It will also require communicating that meeting climate ambitions is achievable and that a successful transition has the potential to result in societal benefits far beyond carbon dioxide emissions reductions alone.<\/p><p> The pandemic provides an opportunity to build back better and for each individual to go from exceptions to new, sustainable routines.  Let us not miss this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elisabeth Windisch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Windisch for her very detailed and interesting opening statement.

I am a freight specialist and my comments will relate to freight and logistics.  There is general agreement that freight transport will be a difficult sector to abate in carbon terms, partly because of its heavy dependence on fossil fuel but also because of the forecast growth rates for freight traffic.  On that point, however, Ireland is to some extent an exception because its freight traffic growth has been relatively slow.  Ireland has still not got back to the level of freight activity it had in 2007.  Indeed, the trend in Ireland's freight traffic growth has decoupled from the growth of its economy, which many countries are aspiring to achieve.  Nonetheless, one should not be complacent because it will still be a challenge for Ireland to meet its carbon targets for 2030 as they relate to the freight sector.<br\/><br\/>I note that the committee uses the avoid-shift-improve, ASI, framework in its work.  In my work on freight transport, I like to divide the improve category in three, looking at asset utilisation, energy efficiency and switching to lower-carbon energy sources.  I would like to examine the five sets of measures.  On the avoid option, we can try to restrain<b><\/b>the growth of freight traffic.  This takes us a bit beyond the transport realm into sustainable consumption, which includes the circular economy, minimising waste and so forth, just to reduce the amount of stuff we have to transport.  We can digitise more physical goods.  We could also reverse some of the logistics trends that have driven freight traffic growth over the past few decades, moving back to more decentralised logistics or sourcing more products locally.  These measures, it seems, have a fairly high carbon mitigation cost.<br\/><br\/>The second aspect is modal shift.  I believe I am correct in saying that Ireland has the most road-dependent economy in Europe in terms of freight.  The railways account for about 0.5% of its total freight transport.  If it were to make a shift with freight, it would be starting from a very low base.  Perhaps, however, we should broaden the definition of modal shift.  In an urban area, for example, we can think about getting freight out of vans into cargo cycles, thus moving to non-motorised modes of freight transport that would help.  We could consider more coastal shipping of freight.<br\/><br\/>The third set of initiatives relates to asset utilisation.  I have looked at the figures, which show that Ireland's percentage of trucks running empty is significantly above the EU average.  There is potential for filling vehicles more effectively.  Current developments in digitalisation in this regard will help, including the use of online platforms to help companies to find backloads for their vehicles.  It would also help if we could encourage companies to share their logistics assets through the process of supply-chain collaboration.  Maybe even more radical measures, such as relaxing the just-in-time principle, could be considered.  This principle gets blamed for much of the under-loading of vehicles.<br\/><br\/>The fourth category of measures includes improving energy efficiency.  Ireland, like all EU countries, will benefit from the imposition of fuel economy standards for trucks, which will see the carbon intensity of new trucks reducing by 15% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.  That, however, is a longer-term development.  There are things we can do in the meantime to improve the energy efficiency of trucking, such as training drivers to drive their vehicles more fuel-efficiently.  I am aware that this was the subject of a recent Irish Government study.<br\/><br\/>My final category of initiates involves shifting to lower-carbon forms of energy in the freight sector.  My preference in this regard is for electrifying as much as possible and then taking advantage of the decarbonisation of electricity.  Ireland's electricity had relatively high carbon intensity but the rate has been dropping quite steeply in recent years.  Electrification will be very easily done in urban areas for local deliveries.  The decarbonisation of vans by using electricity is already well under way.  It is going to be a tougher challenge for long-haul road freight.  There is a debate at the moment as to whether this should be achieved by batteries, hydrogen or electrifying the highways.  It seems that for a country the size of Ireland, where the average length of haul for freight is only 60 km or 70 km, the best approach would be to use batteries to decarbonise.  The good news is that we can use a range of technologies to decarbonise freight.  If they are applied in combination in a time-phased way, it will help Ireland to meet its carbon-reduction targets by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan McKinnon"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McKinnon for that.

I am director of a specialist consultancy, Transport for Quality of Life, based in the UK.  I am vice-chair of a steering group appointed by the Welsh Government to oversee the delivery of public transport and active travel schemes in south-east Wales, set up after the Welsh Government cancelled the construction of a motorway around Newport, south Wales.  I am also a board member of Transport for London but I am speaking today in a personal capacity.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make five points.  First, the aim to reduce carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 is very challenging.  Vehicle electrification will certainly make the largest contribution to that reduction but will not be enough on its own.  With a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, the majority of cars on the road will probably still be powered by fossil fuels into the early 2030s.  That is because the average car is used for 14 years before it is scrapped.<\/p> <p>   Second, given what I have said about fossil fuels, in addition to using technological solutions, we will need to change travel behaviours, as Dr. Windisch has said.  The UK Climate Change Committee has recently recommended reducing demand, or care mileage, by 6% by 2030, through modal shift and measures that reduce the need to travel, such as remote working.  I view 6% as a minimum &ndash; not least because there are significant risks of underachieving the necessary carbon savings if the take-up of electric cars is slower than forecast.<\/p> <p>  We have recently done some work for the Welsh Government to develop sustainable transport mode share targets.  The Welsh Government published its transport strategy last week, including for the first time a target to increase sustainable transport mode share from 32% to 45% by 2040.<\/p><p>Wales also has a target to have 30% of the workforce work remotely on a regular basis.  Scotland has set a target to reduce <i>per capita<\/i>car mileage by 20%.  It is that kind of strategy and those kinds of targets that are necessary.<br\/><br\/>Third, we need to pull all policy levers in the same direction.  It is no good investing in cycleways and public transport while at the same time building more roads.  We recently undertook an independent assessment of the English Department for Transport&rsquo;s &pound;27 billion road investment strategy, RIS2.  We found that RIS2 was likely to increase cumulative CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions by about 20 megatonnes between now and 2032.  That is about 5% of emissions from the strategic road network over the relevant time period.  About one-third of the additional emissions are from construction, one-third from increases from high speeds and one-third from induced traffic.  The UK Climate Change Committee has argued that the UK should prioritise broadband investment over road network expansion.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, if we are to achieve significant mode shift, very substantial investment - both capital and ongoing revenue - is required.  That implies a transfer of resources away from road construction.  We need to design cycle networks as good as those in the Netherlands and Denmark.  The growth in popularity of e-bikes means that longer cycle trips become more feasible and so cycle superhighways radiating out from towns for 15 km or more should be part of a decarbonisation strategy.  We need comprehensive integrated rail and bus networks as good as those in Switzerland and Germany, running from early in the morning until late at night, seven days a week.  We need to recognise a universal basic right for everyone to be able to have a decent life without having to own or drive a car.<br\/><br\/>My final point is that road user charging, what I call a pay-per-mile &ldquo;eco levy&rdquo; on driving, should be part of the package to shift travel behaviours and income from it should be ring-fenced to provide an ongoing revenue stream for sustainable transport.  Road user charging is seen as politically difficult but the evidence from Stockholm, Milan, London and elsewhere is that it creates more winners than losers and particularly benefits older people, young people, those on a low income and women.  Places that have implemented a road user charge find that once people see how it improves their town or city, there is net support.  We need to explore imaginative options.  For example, some of the money from an eco levy could be used to fund free local public transport.  A number of towns in France have made local bus services free with very positive results.  I am very pleased because I live in Wales that the new Wales transport strategy includes a promise to deliver a strategy for fair road user charging over the next five years.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, we need both technological and behavioural change.  It is necessary to reduce car mileage and that implies a sustainable travel mode share target, a traffic reduction target or both.  Modal shift will be undermined by large-scale road construction.  We should look at creative options like a pay-per-mile eco levy on driving to generate a funding stream for benefits like free local bus services.  We need to take the best from other countries and apply all of it in order to respond to the challenge we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>This meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours.

I was very interested to hear at the weekend that a new road linking the N4 motorway to Cardiff Airport is no longer being funded.  As I understand it, this is part of the new Welsh transport strategy.  I am interested in hearing more about this, although not specifically about that project.  There appears to be a major policy shift in Wales and the UK generally away from road building.  It is interesting that this is the approach taken.  What is also very interesting is that there seems to be cross-party support in the UK for this approach.  Dr. Sloman said that the UK Climate Change Committee has recommended that journey demand be reduced by 6%.  I would like to hear more about that, and the principle of reducing demand for journeys and not continuing with road projects that have been planned, perhaps for some time.  I am also interested in the Scottish approach to achieving a <i>per capita<\/i>mileage reduction of, I believe, 20%.<\/p><p>In response to Professor McKinnon, I think we all know that rail freight is suited to long distances.  Are there payloads that are particularly suited to distances of less than 300 km, as we would have in Ireland?  I am also very interested in the point about sharing truck capacity and that a lot of emissions arise from empty trucks driving around.  How far gone are we in realising some of the big changes in logistics about which Professor McKinnon spoke?  <\/p><p>I was very interested in Dr. Windisch's point about smaller vehicles, e-bikes and cargo bikes.  She indicated that these are particularly suited to town and city centres.  Could she elaborate on how we might incentivise smaller vehicles versus larger vehicles, why we should do so and if there is international experience in that area?  I am very interested in the potential of e-bikes because a cycleable journey now is no longer 2 or 3 km; it is probably up to 15 km.  I am very interested in hearing more about that.

My sense is that there is a wide recognition in Wales that one cannot ride two horses at the same time.  We cannot build roads and create increased traffic and car dependence and also hope to achieve modal shift.  This is not a universal view politically but there is a growing sense of support from all political parties.  I do not think that is necessarily true in other parts of the UK.  I certainly do not think it is true in England so different pictures are emerging from different parts of the UK.<br\/><br\/>The other factor in all of this is that building roads is expensive.  If we need to find more money to invest in world-class public transport networks and cycle facilities, it makes sense to reduce the road budget to free up money for that.  One of my colleagues has done a piece of work that was published today looking at the potential for investment in rural bus services in England.  It is very clear that reallocation of the funding that is currently being spent on road building would enable something akin to Swiss-style public transport service frequency standards, with every village having a service every hour throughout the day.  It feels as if these are the sorts of ambitions we need and they are really only possible if we stop spending so much money on road building.  <br\/><br\/>On the point about modal share targets and traffic reduction targets, in the analysis we did for the Welsh Government, we realised that reducing traffic mileage to the extent implied by the Scottish target - a 20% reduction in <i>per capita <\/i>mileage - is very challenging and requires investment in high-quality alternatives and definitely some form of demand management, whether that is road user charging or other restrictions on car use.  The conclusion is inescapable.  We need to look at demand management as well as improvements over the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The Chairman's first question related to rail freight and increasing rail's share of the freight market in Ireland.  He is right.  The average length of haul is very low on the road network.  It is difficult for the railways to compete where the length of haul is short but one must also factor in other variables.  It also depends partly on the quantity of freight being moved.  Here in the UK, there are examples of perfectly viable rail connections over distances of 40 or 50 miles.  Backloading can also improve the commercial viability of the service.  Another factor that must be taken into account is the proportion of factories and warehouses in Ireland that have a rail connection.  I suspect relatively few do.  In that case, one is dependent on an intermodal operation which includes a road feeder movement at one or both ends of the transit.  Where the length of the rail haul is very short, long road feeder movements make it very difficult to provide the service competitively.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at the EU's smart and sustainable mobility strategy, published in December, one will see that the strategy's main emphasis is on freight modal shift.  There is a move under way in the EU and globally to get more freight onto rail.  Ireland should attempt to do that insofar as possible.  It would, however, be starting from a very low base.  The contribution the freight modal split will make to Ireland's decarbonisation by 2030 will probably be quite limited.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman's second point related to empty running.  I do not know why Ireland has a higher level of empty running by trucks than other EU member states.  To some extent, it may be due to geographical imbalances in the traffic flow.  It could also be to do with the length of haul.  If the average length of haul is very short, companies do not have a great incentive to find a backload.  If the average length of haul in Ireland was 500 km, companies would put a lot of time and effort into finding return loads.  The one positive thing I can say in this regard is that digitalisation is changing the freight market.  This is creating the opportunity for companies to find matching loads in both directions electronically.  More and more companies are participating in that.  We recently carried out a survey of more than 90 senior executives in logistics across Europe and the one trend on which they were all agreed was that digitalisation is going to transform logistics over the next five to ten years.  That will be reflected in a reduction in the empty running of trucks everywhere, including in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan McKinnon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I will just repeat the question.  The Chairman touched on the topic of small vehicles, how their use could be encouraged and what the issues were more generally in that regard.  More specifically, he expressed an interest in e-bikes.  There are two issues with the use of smaller vehicles.  The first is that people tend to buy one, two or maybe three personal mobility means.  One of these is often a private car, which serves all needs.  To think about holiday trips in summer, people may want to take a lot of baggage and their children.  Families therefore obviously need to buy big cars, but they also use this car to go to work and for all kinds of other trips where more efficient mobility means would be better and more efficient to use.  To encourage the right use of the vehicle, we would have to move away from the model of owning one's own car and making use of it all the time.  As I said in my statement, policy would be required to encourage a shift towards an ecosystem of shared use of vehicles, which would encourage people to use the right size of vehicles at all times rather than always falling back on this one-size-fits-all option, which for many people actually only perfectly fits for the purposes of holidays.<\/p> <p>  There is a second issue with regard to the topic of size of vehicles.  The Chairman will have noticed that, over the past 30 or 40 years, the size of passenger cars has significantly increased while the number of people the vehicle can carry has not.  In the mid-1970s, an average passenger car weighed approximately 1 tonne while the average passenger car in the European Union today weighs approximately 1.5 tonnes.  This results in these vehicles being much less efficient and using much more petrol, thereby creating more emissions.  An argument often made in this context is that these weight increases were necessary to achieve benefits in safety and convenience, through sound systems and whatnot.  However, this argument is not really valid if we think about it.  While there are improved safety systems, the very fact that the cars are heavier creates a system that is much less safe for everyone else.  If we were to drive this argument forward, very soon everybody would be driving around the city in a tank, which is obviously not an efficient way of getting around.  <\/p> <p>  Pressing this issue on is a bit more tricky because tackling it is not really in the remit of Irish authorities.  Rather, it is something that must happen at EU level.  We are all aware of super emissions standards for cars, trucks and vehicles in general.  There is an inherent problem in these standards in that, while they aim to reduce CO2 emissions on a per kilometre basis, they are dependent on the weight of the vehicles themselves.  There is, therefore, no real incentive for manufacturers to reduce the weight of the vehicles, making them more efficient overall.  In this respect, I can point the Chairman to several studies the International Transport Forum, ITF, has carried out with specific regard to heavier vehicles.  This is an essential issue.  It is also an issue with regard to the uptake of electric vehicles because such vehicles are also much more efficient when they are smaller and lighter.<\/p> <p>  With regard to electric bikes and how they could be encouraged in urban and even non-urban environments, there is a growing trend globally and internationally.  E-bikes have been introduced to shared vehicle fleets and this has also encouraged many private persons to take them up.  They can see the benefits and that they can cover longer distances.  This is a very positive trend because the use of such bikes replaces many commuter trips.  Such journeys are definitely more efficient than trips in private cars.  E-bikes are obviously not perfect, unlike proper active mobility, such as walking or biking without electrical assistance.  They also require additional infrastructure.  This is not to say that e-bikes should not be encouraged; quite the opposite.  They should be encouraged because the benefits will certainly outweigh everything else.  <\/p> <p>  With the introduction of innovative shared services and mobility means, policymakers must make sure that the right people are attracted.  We do not want to attract people who would otherwise use mass public transport as this would likely result in increased emissions.  This will depend on a very local context, on the city and on whether the public mass transit system is fuelled by electricity or fossil fuels.  Specific comparisons must be made to ascertain whether it would be beneficial but generally measures to encourage-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elisabeth Windisch"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will have to stop Dr. Windisch there because our time is limited.

I have experience of them, having used one in London a number of years ago when I cycled from Barking to the city centre.  Having done a bit of research on the subject, it is clear that for distances that are longer than a certain number of kilometres, 20% of commuter journeys are made by bicycle.  There is potential in making super cycleways as friendly and enjoyable as possible so that people start using them.  That said, while they work in London and other large cities, how do we create sustainable super cycleways in large provincial towns like the one I come from, which has approximately 40,000 people?  Do we use them to link large provincial towns to one another?  How would they work in settings outside of a massive capital city like London?<\/p><p> My second question is also for Dr. Sloman and relates to her fourth point about the eco levy in London.  I get its concept and that the money raised from the levy is ring-fenced for good projects that can benefit people, for example, a warmer homes scheme.  Who has the decision on how that money is spent?  Does it go to the British Government, which then allocates it as it sees fit, or is it ring-fenced to what would be described in Ireland as a local authority?

There is.  Countries like the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark are building cycle superhighways that extend for up to 40 km from their main cities.  The capital region of Denmark - Copenhagen and its surrounding municipalities - have a fantastic network.  Denmark is planning to build 760 km of high-quality cycleway radiating out great distances from the centre of Copenhagen.  People are making journeys of 12 km or 13 km on average on some of Copenhagen's routes and many are using e-bicycles.  In continental Europe, e-bicycles are becoming a mainstream mode of mobility.  The Netherlands is set to reach the point, if it has not already done so, where more than half of new bicycle sales are of e-bicycles.  The kind of cycleway that the Senator experienced in London is applicable to areas outside large metropolitan centres, and when combined with e-bicycles, they make perfect sense.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's second question was about road user charging and who got to keep, spend or decide on the spending of that ring-fenced income.  London's congestion charge dates back to 2003 and its money goes to Transport for London.  The local authority - in this case, the regional transport authority, which is Transport for London - makes the decision about how that money is spent.  There is a live debate under way about what will happen as people stop paying fuel duties because they will be driving electric cars.  In the UK, there are rumblings about the Treasury considering replacing the fuel duty with some sort of road user charge.  If it was a national scheme, who would get to keep that money is unclear.  That is still to play for.  My opinion is that there is a great deal of sense in the money being retained locally, not necessarily at town level, but certainly at sub-regional level because that is the level at which decisions can be made about how to put in place the best possible alternatives.  If one had that kind of system, it would be important if there were rules at national level about how that money could be spent so that it was spent in a way that supported sustainable transport.  This could be interpreted widely.  In Wales, there has been a discussion about whether the money from a road user charge might be spent on keeping rural village schools open, thereby reducing the requirement for people to drive their kids long distances.  That is the level at which the discussion should take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>There are a few barriers to the uptake of electric vehicles, but many of those will be overcome and resolved in the next few years.

In this regard also, I would not be too worried.  It might only be for the first few years when we really want to give a push - Ireland should - that additional financial incentives should be provided for vehicle users, albeit within the constraints that I mentioned in my opening statement.  For example, such incentives should be used for non-urban areas, public fleets and so on first.<\/p> <p>  Another important barrier is the vehicles' range autonomy but there will also be important progress in this regard over the next few years thanks to battery technologies advancing rapidly.  However, we can probably not assume that there will be parity of autonomy between electric vehicles and conventional vehicles very soon.  This barrier will be resolved through the provision of public recharging infrastructure.  From a policy perspective, though, I would not overdo it.  As soon as people have experience of owning electric vehicles and how to use them, they will realise that range is much less of an issue than they originally thought and the normal range of an electric vehicle will always be sufficient as long as they can charge at home and perhaps at the workplace.  As such, infrastructural development should focus mainly on the highway network to cover distances that will be beyond the range of standard electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elisabeth Windisch"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

Since the money to support such an incentive is a finite resource, has she carried out any work on that proposal or is she aware of any examples of where it has been done in other countries?  Of course, this assumes it is legally possible to incentivise based on geography and dispersed rural communities, as opposed to incentivising the whole population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#E00400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>On price parity, I must refer to research done by other organisations.

I have a few questions for them.  It seems to me vehicle sharing is very low hanging fruit in some ways if we could get that going on a scale.  Is there experience in other countries of how it has been scaled up rapidly?  Are there support networks?  I know it is in the main done through the private sector.<\/p> <p>  The other point which appeared to be slightly in dispute between the speakers, in particular Dr. Windisch and Dr. Sloman, is whether to price first or to wait until one has the solutions before introducing pricing on roads, congestion charges and carbon charges.  Would the witnesses care to elaborate?  Les gilets jaunes in France showed the risks of pricing first.  Dr. Sloman said that without prices - an economist would understand this - assets will be insufficiently used and so one over-invests.  I can see the arguments on both sides but I would welcome a comment from each of them on that because it will become a hot political issue.  I heard Dr. Windisch reference in particular the importance of getting people on board.  Where does that fit in to pricing and so on? <\/p> <p>  My next question is to Professor McKinnon.  How far has industry come on board?  Some companies have set net zero targets by 2050 as part of their corporate social responsibility, CSR.  I understand that in the UK the Bank of England is taking a fairly aggressive approach to financial institutions looking at the risk profile of their investment.  Presumably, it looks intensely at freight as one of the areas where one could have stranded assets and so on.  How do we get leverage within the private sector without Government subsidies, taxes and so on which will create competitiveness problems?<\/p> <p>  I have one final question.  I was involved in government when approval was secured for the national broadband plan.  It was extraordinarily difficult to get that through the investment appraisal approach that Government takes because it takes no account of the potential increased usage of a new infrastructure.  It tends to use a static model, taking the view that the same proportion of people will use it into the future as currently use it versus time saving on a road project which it is used to modelling.  Is there a new approach to project appraisal, not just on the roads and national broadband plan, but generally, to take into account, as Dr. Windisch said, the new risk environment in which we are living, but also the new opportunities that are out there in a digitising world that make traditional project appraisal outmoded in that it often misses many of the real opportunities for transformation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#F00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Deputy Bruton has raised some good questions for Dr. Sloman and Dr. Windisch, with a particular question on freight for Professor McKinnon.

That can work very well in the context of parking management and restraints.  One of the recommendations of the recent commission, in which I was involved on behalf of the Welsh Government, looking at alternatives to building another section of the M4 motorway was the introduction of a workplace parking levy for large employers with car parking facilities and to provide supports for car sharing so that there would be the carrot and the stick and for that regular journey car sharing would come to be seen as attractive and sensible.  There are initiatives such as parking cash-out under which people get paid for the days when they do not drive their cars to work, which has worked very effectively in North America and has been used to a limited degree in the United Kingdom by companies such as the pharmaceutical company, Pfizer.<\/p> <p>  On the question on road-user charging and whether it should be done before or after improving the alternatives, the answer is both.  One has to deliver upfront improvements and people have to feel that there are decent alternatives.  I was involved in Transport for London at the time road-user charging in the form of the congestion charge was introduced in central London.  It followed a period of about two years in which the the then mayor, Ken Livingstone, had put very high priority on improving bus services, including the introduction of a &pound;1 flat fare for bus services and improvement of the quality of the bus network.  That meant that people understood that they had alternatives and they were getting better.  The narrative that the congestion charge or eco levy, which might be more of a pay-per-mile scheme, provides the revenue that enables us to carry on improving public transport and creates the political and public narrative in support of it.  It is about upfront investment in improving the alternatives, but also accepting that if we waited for the perfect public transport system and cycle infrastructure, we would never do road-user charging.  We have to do enough to ensure people have an alternative and to then continue to improve those alternatives.  <\/p> <p>  I do not have a great deal to say on appraisal, except that I very much agree with Deputy Bruton that the current appraisal methodologies are not fit for purpose.  There are severe problems with the way in which, over many years, a super-structure has been built up on rather faulty and flaky foundations related to many thousands of drivers saving small amounts of time.  That does not work and it does not serve us very well in appraising public transport and active travel schemes as well as, as mentioned by the Deputy, broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I agree with everything Dr. Sloman said and I will add a few points.  On the shared vehicle question, when speaking about vehicle sharing and what would be the most efficient concept the International Transport Forum is speaking about the provision of on-demand minibus services that can cover distances and geographic areas where mass public transport does not work because density is not high enough yet.  This on-demand minibus service could support the mass public transport system.  We have not seen such a solution put in place on a large scale on purpose but such systems do exist, driven by necessity.<\/p><p>Large metropolitan areas in many Latin American cities, for example, often have a less regulated system of minibus services.  They operate on certain routes but as they also want to increase their profits they frequently divert from those routes, which causes other issues, to make sure they cover the area they want to as well as possible and work at capacity.  These examples can help to determine the benefit of such systems and the capacity they have in terms of covering people's movements around large metropolitan areas.<\/p><p> On the question of pressing, one cannot wait until everybody has shifted to the alternative and is happy with it before one starts pressing it.  It has to go hand-in-hand with other measures.  People should at least have the perspective of an alternative as a minimum.<\/p><p> I refer to the necessity of road user charging.  Let us think about the large-scale uptake of electric vehicles.  Economies will fall significantly short in terms of tax revenue from fossil fuels following a large-scale shift to the use of electric vehicles.  This is how Ireland wants to go forward.  Many countries rely on electric vehicle uptake.  They would, therefore, be well advised to introduce road user charging rather earlier than later in order to avoid a complete backlash from the population. <\/p><p> These pricing systems are not only a necessity for some countries; they can be reinforced if they are implemented properly in line with the polluter and user pays principle in line with what the European Commission suggests.  That can drive the uptake of electric vehicles even further.  It is a win-win situation.  It is a necessity while at the same time helping with the push towards electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elisabeth Windisch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I have worked on decarbonisation logistics for about 15 years.  I have witnessed a real step change in the level of corporate commitment to cutting emissions at a business level.  That percolates down to their effort to decarbonise their logistics and supply chains as well.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned our recent survey, which was reflected in the responses we received from the companies.  It must be remembered that a lot of logistics is outsourced.  Therefore, the basic activity is performed either by big logistics companies like DHL or, in many cases, by small companies.  The big manufacturers and retailers are, therefore, hoping that their logistics providers will decarbonise on their behalf.  They are putting increased pressure on those companies to do so.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems with the freight sector, which applies in particular to road freight, is that it is a highly fragmented industry.  Across Europe as a whole, there are over 500,000 small carriers.  It is an intensely competitive industry.  Many companies struggle to survive.  Therefore, it is hardly surprising that they do not have the time, effort or resources to put into decarbonising their operations.  We carried out another study recently on what needs to be done to motivate small carriers to cut their emissions.<\/p> <p>  One of the other positive things I would say that there is a close correlation between cutting carbon emissions and cutting costs in the logistics sector.  There is a widespread feeling that we are still in what might be called the low-hanging fruit phase of freight decarbonisation.  A lot of the initiatives that will save carbon will cut costs and often have a very short repayment time.  Regrettably, harvesting all of that low-hanging fruit will not get us to our carbon reduction targets for 2035, 2050 and thereafter.  It will, however, get companies started on the process of cutting their emissions.<\/p> <p>  My final point is that these are science-based targets.  An increasing number of big companies are signing up for science-based targets, which means they are committing to absolute reductions in emissions, not just reductions on a carbon-intensity basis.  That matters a lot in the logistics world because until recently almost all of the carbon reduction targets for logistics were carbon-intensity based.  Now companies are looking at ways of getting the numbers right down to zero by 2040 or thereafter.

When we have assessed road schemes, it is generally the case that they result in an increase in traffic because increasing road capacity encourages more car-dependent development.  It typically also results in an increase in vehicle speeds.  If vehicle speeds increase from 60 mph to 70 mph that would result in an increase in vehicle emissions of, on average, about 13%.  It is very hard to square road building with a strategy of urgently needing to reduce carbon emissions.<\/p> <p>  We should be stopping new road building.  There may be certain very exceptional cases where it makes sense from a safety perspective to put in place some sort of change in the design of a road, but what we should not be doing is increasing road capacity.  If we are looking to reduce traffic mileage, we do not need to increase road capacity in most cases.<\/p> <p>  On the question of free public transport, I absolutely agree with the Deputy that it could encourage a wider range of people to experience public transport.  France is going through a very interesting phase at the moment whereby towns are making local public transport free.  Dunkirk introduced free bus services in September 2018, just over two years ago, and at the same time as making its services free it also put in place some improvements to the bus service.  Bus use increased by about 85% in the space of one year.  The mayor of Dunkirk is on record as saying that people tried the buses because they were free and carried on using them because they are good. <\/p> <p>  The idea is that we should consider trying to get people to sample bus services by making them free.  In many jurisdictions making bus services free is cheaper than one might expect because they are already very heavily subsidised by the state.  It is certainly true in France.  To a degree it is true in Wales.  The additional funding that one needs in order to make bus services free is relatively limited.  The environment benefit of that in terms of enticing people to change their whole lifestyle can be very significant.<\/p><p>The common charge people make is that it is no good if buses are made free and there is no decent bus network.  Therefore, it is also essential that a high-quality bus service network is created.  The Swiss idea is to have a public transport service frequency standards that say that if one lives in a village of a certain size, one will be entitled to a certain level of bus service.  That seems to me to also be an essential part of that package.  It is about making the service both free and good.  Those are my main comments on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>A case study example of another European city would be Vienna, which has introduced fairly cheap public transport many years ago.

It strikes me that it is about a huge shift.  So much of the transport focus has often been on reducing journey times when in fact this is about reducing journeys and thinking in terms of emission miles.  Whether the target be 6% or 20%, the committee needs to set targets down to the level of emission miles and not just in car ownership and so forth.  I was struck by the importance of things that might not seem to be directly related to emissions such as having places that are nearby, be they post offices or public amenities.  I was also struck by the idea of rural schools being part of our climate response.  Shared school transport seems to be another low-hanging fruit and an example of where we could be doing things a lot better.  Digitalisation, which was mentioned by everybody, is also interesting.  I know that needs to be accompanied by physical infrastructure as well as upskilling because 50% of the population in Ireland are digitally disempowered in that they do not have basic digital skills.<\/p> <p>  I mention targeted measures around electric vehicles and bikes.  Dr. Windisch and Professor McKinnon might look at this.  Is there something around the last mile idea that we could be doing?  When it comes to freight, I mention last mile delivery, empty vehicles and idling.  We should use much smaller vehicles for the end stage of freight delivery.  Are there examples of where that is working well?<\/p> <p>  I also want to ask Professor McKinnon about freight and the TEN-T reforms in respect of ports and rail.  The individual rail journeys in Ireland are quite short and we have rail connections between Rosslare, Cork and Dublin, as well as Belfast from a shared island perspective.  How can we look to be more ambitious about how we connect port and rail freight and make a bigger case in that regard, possibly even from the TEN-T European funding perspective?  We must make sure that where freight is on roads, we keep it on motorways and that we do not have freight vehicles idling and using smaller motorways.  That might require specific and targeted measures to keep freight on railways.  We know we have a problem with freight going off-road onto smaller roads.  Could we be using life cycle costing in procurement to really incentivise smaller vehicles for freight and shorter distances?<\/p> <p>  On the road user tax, in 2019 the committee heard that we are in fact subsidising car transport to the degree of &euro;650 per person per year.  We hear a lot about road tax but we are already subsidising car usage.  We can make the decision at a political level to shift our investment.  Rather than waiting for a road tax to then provide money that we then might invest in public transport, we can in fact make that shift by deciding to put in place ambitious ideas in terms of public transport.  The idea of public transport for every village every hour is something that I know many across Ireland would love to see.  Is the case that we might need to skip the State and not rely on consumer change to fund substantial change but to front-load investment in a radically different option?

I agree with Dr. Sloman that any future road building should be targeted towards areas where there is a particular problem.  Looking at it from a freight standpoint, if trucks get held up on congested roads then there is a big fuel penalty associated with that.  Therefore, if there is a severe bottleneck there may be some limited justification for road building.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that if we fill the vehicles better we would reduce the amount of vehicle traffic on the road.  I do not have the figure for Ireland but in the UK, freight vehicles represent about 7% or 8% of the entire fleet.  Cars dominate the flow of traffic.  I mentioned digitalisation a few times and the way we can deploy a range of IT tools to help with this.  A lot of companies are using this to dynamically reroute their vehicles once they are on the road network to avoid more congested stretches of road, which is allowing us to adapt our freight operations to a road network which is suffering congestion in some areas.  I mention the potential to reschedule deliveries into the evening or during the night in order that freight vehicles are able to travel at their most fuel efficient speeds and thereby evade daytime congestion.  A lot of work is being done to look at that as well.  There are a lot of alternatives to simply expanding road capacity.<\/p> <p>  If one is looking at the road building option, one must think of the carbon footprinting of the road construction process itself because often when that is factored into the calculation, one discovers that it takes many years to get a carbon payback on simply building more road space.  That also relates to the point that was made about the routing of the vehicles.  I agree that sometimes drivers these days use GPS and do not realise that it is taking them onto routes that are too small for the vehicle's capacity.  I am not sure if this happens in Ireland but we have had lots of examples in the UK of big trucks going onto small rural roads and causing blockages and so forth.  We are increasingly talking about smart highways and vehicles and telematic systems.  This gives us huge opportunity for tailoring the movement and pattern of freight delivery to the capacity of the road network.  Therefore, there is a lot of potential in what Senator Higgins said.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins also asked the question about last mile delivery within urban areas.  This is a subject that has greatly interested me for about 20 years.  In terms of carbon emissions, is it better for people to shop online or to go to the shops to buy their goods?  We did one of the first studies on that comparison way back in 2007 and 2008.  We concluded that on balance, if the van delivering the goods to the home was well-loaded, that would have a lower carbon footprint than the person driving to a shop.  Once one factors a car shopping trip into the calculation, there is a spike in emissions.  It is debatable if one goes by public transport to the shops.  On balance, there are things we can do to reduce the carbon intensity of last mile delivery where, for example, people do not get the goods delivered to the home but they go to a locker bank, for example.  That has been shown to cut emissions.  As online retailing has expanded, the volumes of freight going through the last mile have been increasing and that has been improving the load factors of the vehicles.  However, there are some trends heading in the opposite direction.  Many of the big online retailers are trying to differentiate themselves by being able to make a rapid delivery overnight or on the same day.  When that happens, the vehicles are inevitably less well used.<\/p><p>The load factors decline and the carbon emissions per order delivered increase.  That is one worrying trend.<\/p><p> Another trend is the proportion of online retail products that get sent back.  As much as 40% or 50% of items of fashion clothing get sent back up the supply chain.  That is reducing the relative carbon advantage of using the online channel as opposed to the retail shopping channel.  I draw the attention of the committee to some interesting work done by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey about a year ago.  They looked at 24 things that can be done to reduce the carbon intensity of online retailing.  It included some of the things I have just mentioned, such as locker banks.  Other things included switching to electric vehicles and so forth.  Combining that range of initiatives would allow us to significantly reduce the carbon emissions from last mile delivery.<\/p><p> The Senator also mentioned procurement.  It has a critical role to play.  I mentioned earlier that, in logistics, so much freight and warehousing is now outsourced that the big manufacturers and retailers can get leverage on the carbon intensity of those operations through the way they procure those logistics services.  There is other work being done these days by, for example, the smart freight centre in the Netherlands, giving companies advice on how they can buy freight services in a way that will minimise carbon emissions.  That has been a rather long answer but the Senator raised a range of issues in her question.  I thank her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan McKinnon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I am conscious that there is not that much time left so perhaps I could get a written answer to the question about port and rail freight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#J00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan McKinnon"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McKinnon for that detailed answer.

Having hard targets and holding Government to account in respect of them feels to me to be very important.<\/p> <p>  I will not speak to it now but I will send some information about \"every village, ever hour\", the slogan that has been adopted by Nordhessen in Germany.  The Germans are deadly serious about achieving that and it might be an interesting example.

This is a development that should not be missed and a lot of work should be put into it because it can facilitate public transport journeys and having intermodal journeys, especially in an urban area such as the greater Dublin area.

This has been an enjoyable session and I appreciate their time.  My first question is for Dr. Sloman.  There is a misconception that if we put enough money and time into this modal shift, we can keep going along the same mode at the exact same time.  In that context, I appreciate all of Dr. Sloman's comments.  Is it her contention that we will be unable to do both because we will not have the money or is it because the targets are so difficult to meet that we do not have the time to do both?<\/p> <p>  There was mention of remote working.  Wales is setting an ambitious target of 30% in respect of remote working.  Dr. Sloman has spoken about moving investment from roads into broadband.  Are there smaller ways in which we could try to prepare?  We are, obviously, rolling out broadband and we have put significant investment into that.  Are there other ideas that could help us with that move to remote working because it could be transformative for Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Windisch mentioned the 15-minute city.  There is another misconception that the 15-minute city means as the crow flies when one can be in a 15-minute city but it can take half an hour to get around it if there are barriers in place.  Some of those barriers are actually very cheap to remove.  Do our guests have some ideas on that?  I am thinking, for instance, that children sometimes cycle for kilometres to a destination when they could just nip over a wall if they did not have a bike with them.  What about permeability, kissing gates or any other ideas like that?  Is there low-hanging fruit that would get us to those targets?  What is Dr. Windisch's opinion on road building and how it can take us away from that 15-minute city, never to return, because of the kind of planning that is set in motion?  She also mentioned the forthcoming report that suggests that if 20% of car users in the Dublin area shifted to shared mobility, 40% less street space would be required.  There is an argument that if we build more roads we can move people out of the space and then leave the space for people to cycle and walk on, and use public transport.  That seems intuitively incorrect.  What is Dr. Windisch's opinion on whether that is the correct way to go about things and put our transport plans together?<\/p> <p>  I also have a question about freight for Professor McKinnon.  We are trying balance our climate ambitions and regional development.  That regional development would mean that people would not have to travel as far to work and so on if we can build up industry in, for example, the north west.  We have decommissioned rail lines that could be used for freight.  An alternative to regional development may be that we would have to develop our road structures further.  The options are a rail line, developing roads further or not developing in those areas at all.  The professor mentioned that moving to rail may not be commercially viable.  Has he looked at that commercial viability for an entire community or region, also taking into consideration governmental investment as opposed to investments by individual companies in rail freight?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#J00700","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I think I am right in understanding that her first point was around road building.  She was asking if we should not build roads because we do not have the money or because the targets are so challenging that we do not have the time.  It is the latter.  To achieve the reduction in carbon that we need to achieve is very challenging indeed.  Road building that increases road capacity and opens up land for car-dependent developments will make it impossible to achieve a modal shift away from driving and towards travel by public transport, walking and cycling.<\/p><p>Of course, if we do not need to build roads then we save money and can invest that in sustainable transport.  It becomes a virtuous circle.  Fundamentally, a large road construction programme is not compatible with taking the climate emergency seriously.<\/p><p> On the point made about remote working, one of the things the Welsh Government is looking at is the idea of super-fast broadband-enabled remote-working hubs.  We all know from the last year, it is fine working from home if one has a spare office or a spare bedroom to work in but many people, particularly young people, may not have a good space to work in.  There may be noise from children and it may be difficult to work from home.  One of the things the Welsh Government is looking at is repurposing either public buildings or supporting the private sector to develop remote working hubs so a person can cycle a couple of miles to his or her local remote hub and work from there rather than having to drive 15 miles to his or her office.  That is still at the discussion stage within the Welsh Government.  It is an idea that seems very worthwhile.<\/p><p> I will make one point about the question directed at Dr. Windisch around street space requirements and the efficiency in the way we use our street space.  In London, Transport for London built the cycleway over Blackfriars Bridge.  The cycle lane is able to move as many people as would be moved in two and a half lanes of general traffic but it only takes up half the space.  One could say it is five times more efficient.  In general, the cycleways in London - the east-west and north-south cycleways - have more capacity because they have cycleways and more people can be moved on those corridors than could have been before the cycleways were built.  Reallocating road space to more efficient modes, whether to buses or to bikes, actually makes the city function more efficiently.  It is a very sensible thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>As we have under half an hour remaining, I want to be fair to all members.

It depends on the nature of the industrial development in the peripheral region.  What are the products being produced and distributed from there?  It is clear the railways have an advantage in the moved primary commodities, which are the lower value things.  It is hard to generalise about that.  People often think there is a conflict between the desire to cut carbon emissions from an economy and promoting regional development because the thinking is we should try to shorten the distances over which freight is moved.  That does not necessarily apply.  If one can use a lower carbon transport mode, then that is certainly beneficial.  Through time, the carbon intensity of freight transport will reduce.  Carbon emissions per vehicle-kilometre, per tonne-kilometre will decline and therefore the carbon penalty associated with developing industry in a peripheral region will reduce as well.  It is hoped the two objectives of regional development and decarbonisation will ultimately be compatible.

It strikes me that we have well established structures for finding and delivering solutions to roads problems.  Could Dr. Sloman speak about her experience in Newport and the road in Cardiff Airport, as the Chair mentioned?  We have many examples in Ireland, and I presume elsewhere, of real problems with congestion on a daily basis.  The solutions which are proposed and most often delivered are wider and bigger roads.  I am interested to know whether there is a practical example of an occasion where there was a roads solution on the table and an alternative was delivered.  In my experience, most people want congestion removed and their lived experience improved on.  I am interested in that.  Do the witnesses believe there is a need for a mindset change, a governance change or a governmental change in terms of our Departments' assessment tools, and the training of our transport professionals to achieve that mindset change and consideration of the new dispensation?<\/p> <p>  What is the comparative experience of Dr. Sloman and Dr. Windisch in Britain and internationally?  The Irish challenge relates to the geographically dispersed nature of many of our communities.  We have a particular challenge in the geographical distribution of our communities in which we have low density.  Would the witnesses have any suggestions taking the comparison between London and Wales, for example, of policy priorities?  What should we be looking at and are there good international examples?  Does it involve school or bus transport, car sharing, demand for transport or something else?<\/p> <p> Can Professor McKinnon speak about the development of the technology for batteries and hydrogen for freight, and the performance, availability and affordability of that?

That scheme had been on the books for probably 25 years.<\/p><p>It was perceived as a scheme to solve a congestion problem during peak hours when traffic speeds on that section of the motorway where it narrows down to two lanes and goes through some tunnels can fall to 25 mph and journeys are unreliable.  The environmental cost of building another section of motorway - to dual the motorway, if one likes - was massive and the Welsh First Minister made the decision not to go ahead with the scheme.  I will send the committee the final report of the South East Wales Transport Commission, of which I was a member, which examined what could be done to solve that congestion problem without building more motorway.  We developed some recommendations, including increasing the number of stations, improving rail infrastructure, tackling bus governance - the lack of which is a big issue in the whole of the United Kingdom - and regulating bus services again, which is a big problem for us, in order that we could provide a comprehensive integrated network and a network of cycleways and bus priority measures.  It will take time to implement that package but we were absolutely confident at the end that it would provide a better solution to congestion on that section of motorway at lower cost.<\/p><p> On the challenge of geographically dispersed communities, the places to look at are the rural hinterlands of cantons in Switzerland.  Many areas of continental Europe do this well.  Dr. Windisch has referred to Austria, Germany has some fantastic public transport networks in rural areas.  The best of the best are areas such as the cantons of Zurich and Bern where rural areas have guaranteed service levels.  Administrations in these areas tend to favour fixed public transport networks over demand responsive transport because people trust that and believe it will always be there for them.  For this reason, it attracts more users than a demand responsive service.  Those are the places that can offer lessons for rural areas in Ireland on how to provide people with an effective alternative to driving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Would Dr. Windisch care to speak on geographic distribution and how we resolve that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#L00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>This is definitely one of the trickiest parts to decarbonise.

We are working closely with some Scandinavian countries and looking at these countries could also be helpful.  As Dr. Sloman said on transport services, this could be an option but these areas especially may not experience the uptake they could or should.

In the case of vans and small rigid vehicles, it will be battery electrification without question.  Already, the total cost of ownership for a small van for an electric vehicle is comparable with that of a petrol or a diesel van.  I think that process will continue.  The challenge is more at the long-haul end for the heavier trucks where the options are battery, hydrogen fuel cell, possibly biomethane, although there is not very much of that, or e-highways.  I point out that in Germany and Sweden, for example, they are trialling the electrification of highways.  Analysis has shown that if there is a sufficient volume of truck traffic, that can be quite a cost effective way of decarbonising long distance road freight.<\/p> <p>  There is a big push at the moment for hydrogen for trucks.  I am a hydrogen sceptic.  Almost all the hydrogen we have at the moment is made from methane.  It is, therefore, essentially a fossil fuel.  It will take a long time to get to green hydrogen where we make hydrogen with zero-carbon electricity, electrolysing water.  When we do that we waste a lot of energy in that electrolysis process.  We can waste as much as 70% of our energy.  That may be an option in big countries where the trucks have a long distance range such as the US where they may have to travel 1,000 km.  However, because Ireland is a relatively small country and the length of haulage is relatively short, the new generation of truck batteries will be perfectly capable of handling that sort of distance range and would be a more efficient measure.  The issue will be the cost of these trucks, which are not available yet.  The first battery-powered trucks will probably be mass produced in the next two or three years.  I noticed in Ireland's case, the Irish truck fleet is a bit older than the EU average.  It takes about 14 years for Ireland to replace its truck fleet.  When these low-carbon vehicles become available, it will not help much in getting Ireland to its 2030 target but it will help to get to the 2040 and 2050 targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan McKinnon"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations.

I concede, however, that this is exceptional.  Many people think that railways require a length of haul in excess of 200 km to be viable.  There are examples from the past of short distance viable rail movements where there were merry-go-round services from coal miles to power stations.  However, that type of transit is obviously a thing of the past as countries have been getting out of coal powered electricity.<\/p> <p>  Another issue of modal split is that the railways will have a problem increasing their share of the freight market because one of their core traffics has been fossil fuel - coal and oil.<\/p><p>As we use fewer of those primary products, it is going to be tough for railways to replace those products with higher value manufactured goods.

She covered much of what I wanted to ask when she responded to Deputy O'Rourke.  The idea of moving to electric vehicles and creating cycling superhighways has quite often been met with a great deal of scepticism in rural areas.  People think that these initiatives would never happen in their areas but I guess it is up to us to lead and to change attitudes.<\/p> <p>  In the past 12 months there has been a significant investment in cycleways, greenways and cycling lanes.  In rural areas like the one from which I come, however, we do not have shovel-ready projects that would, with a bit of investment, lead to connectivity between rural areas and towns, villages and towns and between towns.  As has been mentioned, part of that reason is the geographical nature of these areas.  They have a lot of hilly topography and other geographical features that create difficulties.  Much of it is down to the fact that we have intensively farmed agricultural lands so there is a reluctance straight away to see features developed.  It has been mentioned that we could analyse the model used in the Swiss cantons, which is certainly worth examining.  Is the answer an electric light bus service that regularly serves towns, villages and smaller rural settlements?<\/p> <p>  Cycling superhighways sound absolutely fantastic and are something I would love to see rolled out.  However, from the experience so far, I can see immediately that there are barriers to such a scenario and an attitude of \"Why can't we do it\" as opposed to \"How do we do it?\".  We used to have a terrific rail service but, unfortunately, all of the tracks were lifted and the land is now used for agricultural purposes.  The idea of returning to the previous scenario in this regard has also met with a lot of scepticism.  I will consider the Swiss canton model.

Some countries are trying to decarbonise, while some cities are setting carbon reduction targets, and presumably, they will want to do that for activities within that boundary.  If the same is done at a regional level, the problem is that any region will be criss-crossed by many supply chains.  There will be a great deal of through traffic.  A former colleague of mine examined how a region in England could be decarbonised.  Running through the region was a major motorway on which there was heavy truck traffic.  Should that be included in a carbon calculation?  Such issues will be encountered.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, if a region expands its economy, is more vibrant and can become a bit more self-sufficient, that will be beneficial because it will reduce the quantity of freight-related emissions, but it is difficult to do that because of the structure of modern supply chains.  Very few economic sectors are localised to that degree.  I often think, therefore, that if we are decarbonising freight transport, we should not be thinking about it at a local or regional level but rather at a national level to take account of these interdependences between the various supply chains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan McKinnon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>To respond specifically on the issue of public transport lanes and whether they have a place, I think they definitely do.

I would definitely recommend introducing public transport lanes where possible.<\/p> <p>  On shared mobility and how this may be in conflict with other local areas, at this stage we should not over-regulate matters but rather let micro-solutions evolve.

On the question of what was the imperative to introduce free public transport, in some places such as Dunkirk that was about restoring people's belief in their town.  It was about creating a sense of pride in the place where they live and regenerating the town in order that the young people will want to stay there.  It is absolutely the case that Dunkirk has been the focus of great national and international interest, and it has been a massive success, not only from an environmental point of view but from the point of view of people just believing in their city again.<\/p> <p>  We have free parks, free public libraries and sometimes free museums.  We have all sorts of wonderful cultural assets in our towns and cities, but if someone lives in a city where he or she cannot afford to travel to those places, that is not so great.   There is a growing awareness that perhaps free local public transport should be part of that universal basic right to a good quality of life.  Although free public transport can be beneficial by getting more people to use public transport and being a help in terms of achieving our carbon objectives, the driving force behind it is about cities wanting their residents to believe in the place where they live and to feel proud of it.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Sullivan's point about what we should do in rural places where cycle superhighways do not seem to be a serious option, other European countries have had the exact same struggles.  Take the example of the cycle superhighway programme in the capital region of Denmark.  Copenhagen has been building cycleways for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, but the surrounding rural area around the city has not been doing that and it has been a complex, tortuous process to get all those surrounding rural areas to agree it makes sense to invest the money and buy land to provide those cycleways.  We see these things in other countries and think it must always have been like that, but it was not.  It is worth being ambitious, and if it is impossible to imagine doing it nationally at the start, perhaps it should be about trial projects and asking what we can do for rural cycling and making it an attractive option.  If that is done in terms of cycleways parallel to national roads, perhaps that will be easier than dealing with roads controlled by local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I will send some information to the committee regarding cycleways in Denmark and on the cantons of Zurich and Bern and the fantastic work that has been done in those places to make rural public transport an attractive option for people whereby they know and trust that it will always be there for them, so they can plan their lives around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021032300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Sloman"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sloman.

I am joined by R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hickey from the Irish economic analysis division of the Central Bank.  I will give a brief summary of the outlook for the economy, drawing on the macroeconomic forecasts set out in our latest quarterly bulletin, but I will also take account of the developments and available indicators since then.  We will be publishing updated forecasts in our forthcoming quarterly bulletin at the beginning of April.<\/p> <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic and the measures to contain the spread of the virus, which has caused an unprecedented contraction in the Irish and world economies over the past year, are likely to remain the dominant determinant of the path of the economy this year and in 2022.  The near-term prospects have deteriorated following a resurgence in Covid-19 cases early in 2021.  However, the prospect of a successful deployment of vaccines from an increasing range of choices does offer the prospect of recovery from the second half of the year, underpinned by continued support from accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.<\/p> <p>  Preliminary national accounts statistics, which show GDP growth of 3.4% last year, indicate remarkable resilience in headline growth given the exceptional scale of the shock to domestic and world demand.  However, the headline GDP figure was boosted by strong export growth that was, in turn, largely accounted for by a surge in pharmaceutical exports and continued strength in the IT sector.  This masked a decline in domestic demand which was among the most severe in the EU.  Output declined in all other sectors, with the largest declines in sectors with a high dependence on face-to-face contact with customers including the arts, hotels, bars and restaurants and high-street retailers.  Private consumption last year was down by 9% compared with the previous year, with modified domestic demand down by 5.4%.<\/p> <p>  The impact of the pandemic is particularly evident in the labour market.  While the headline unemployment rate has not changed significantly, reflecting standard international statistical conventions regarding its measurement, the Covid-adjusted rate, which includes those workers who are availing of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, increased rapidly.  It currently stands at a rate of 24.8%.  When we also include the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, approximately 960,000 people, or 39.3% of the labour force, are currently in receipt of one form or other of income support.  The figures also show that younger and lower paid workers have been most affected.<\/p> <p>  The concentration of the pandemic labour market shock among workers in the bottom half of the income distribution is reflected in a corresponding decline in compensation per worker or earnings.  That this has not been reflected in a decline in disposable incomes &ndash; disposable incomes actually increased last year by about 4% &ndash; is testament to the effectiveness of Government income support measures.  Similarly, at firm level, Government support measures have provided significant mitigation to the financial distress to SMEs most affected by pandemic-related business disruption.  These supports, while proportionate and appropriate to the size of the shock to households and firms, have been unprecedented in scale, amounting to more than 11% of modified gross national income, GNI*.  The general government balance has moved from a small surplus of 0.9% to a deficit of just under 9% of GNI* in 2020 and is likely to remain close to that level again this year.  This has resulted also in an increase in public sector debt and the debt-to-national income ratio.<\/p> <p>  The resurgence in infections since December and the reimposition of strict containment measures weakens the near-term outlook and makes it more uncertain.  The containment measures have dampened economic activity significantly in the first quarter of this year and, beyond that, some public health measures are likely to continue to be required, until the successful deployment of effective vaccines reaches a significant proportion of the population.  Assuming successful deployment of vaccines by the second half of the year, domestic economic activity should begin to rebound.  On this basis, modified domestic demand is forecast to grow by 2.9% in 2021, while GDP is projected to grow by 3.8%, although the recovery in the labour market is likely to lag somewhat until the broader economic recovery becomes more established.  The outlook is considerably uncertain, however, and contingent on key assumptions on Covid-19 developments.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, a further pick-up is projected in 2022, with modified domestic demand forecast to grow by 3.6% and GDP projected to grow by 4.6%.  While uncertainty and a subdued labour market are likely to keep precautionary savings elevated in 2021, these restraints should ease next year.  The unwinding of the large stock of savings accumulated during the pandemic should support a strong recovery in consumption in 2022.  Similarly, the reduction in uncertainty should allow investment to begin to recover next year.<\/p> <p>  The new EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, has averted the threat of a no-deal Brexit and means that the significant disruption to economic activity that would have accompanied such an outcome has been avoided.  The new agreement allows for the continuation of a basic economic relationship between the EU and UK.  Nevertheless, the EU-UK TCA makes trade in both goods and services more cumbersome and costly relative to EU membership.  In the short run, this is likely to be associated with continued supply-chain disruption.  In the long run, the negative impact of the UK's EU exit on trade flows, migration and productivity will reduce output in the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude my remarks with some views on the policy response to the pandemic and, in particular, how the available policy instruments can best support a sustainable recovery.  The impact of the pandemic has been mitigated by a range of fiscal, monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy actions to support vulnerable households and businesses.  In the near term, policy must remain focused on supporting household incomes and firm liquidity to provide the most solid basis for recovery.  However, the size and nature of that support should be ready to adapt to changing circumstances.<\/p><p>Policy support should continue to counter the threat to viable economic activities and employment from the pandemic and, in time, facilitate structural transformations that support economically sustainable activities.  This would help to enhance resilience, support the productive capacity of the economy and mitigate scarring effects such as long-term unemployment.<\/p><p> On the fiscal side, the increase in deficit and debt ratios that has occurred has been both warranted and necessary.  Policy support will need to be maintained over the short term to stabilise the economy.  When health risks diminish, however, any continued support via current expenditure should be targeted and temporary, while any permanent increases in current expenditure will need to be funded in a sustainable manner.  Ultimately, more favourable growth dynamics in coming years should support a decline in the public debt ratio.  Even if action does not need to be taken now, however, it is important to plan to reduce the level of the debt ratio in time to a more sustainable level to ensure that the economy can face future shocks with sufficient headroom such that all available policy instruments can be deployed.<\/p><p> I look forward to the discussion with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas, a Chathaoirligh, agus as an gcur i l&aacute;thair sin.<\/p> <p>  How many bonds have been issued by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, since the start of the pandemic and what proportion is held by the ECB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>There have been two issuances this year, amounting to &euro;7 billion.

I had heard that the figure was one third, so the ECB has, essentially, monetised that debt.<\/p> <p>  Following on from that, many have pointed out that a clean distinction between monetary and fiscal policy was one of the first casualties of the global financial crisis of 2008.  In the current crisis, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish where one policy ends and the other begins, which is only natural given where we are today.  This interplay of monetary and fiscal policy has brought a co-ordinated crisis response, one of mutual benefit.  The ECB backstop - the bond markets of member states - is allowing them to engage in countercyclical spending and I very much welcome that.<\/p> <p>  Closer to home, however, there is a crisis in our highly domestic banking sector, which Mario Draghi described as a \"quasi-monopoly\", and the concentration of the banks' internal risk-weighted models means we have the highest mortgage rates in the EU.  A further crisis is that if Ulster Bank's deposit book is distributed among the other banks, they could move to impose negative rates on retail customers.   Moreover, there is the possibility that the Government, through its significant shareholdings, could urge the banks to offset potential negative rates by accessing funding through, perhaps, the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations, TLTRO, which offers the bank funding at negative rates and is unofficially seen as a way to mitigate negative interest rates for banks.<\/p> <p>  Given that a future of banking in Ireland commission could be in train and considering everything I have mentioned, the case for the Central Bank playing an active role in the commission seems fairly indisputable.

It is clear we have a heavily concentrated banking system compared with those of some other European countries, with somewhat less competition.  Legacy and other issues, too, contribute to making our retail interest rates higher than those of other countries.  As the Deputy will probably be aware, they are the second highest in the EU.  That relates partly to previous losses from the crisis and partly to issues with banks being able to access collateral.  This leads to a requirement for more capital in banks, which can pass through to their ability to pass on lower rates to consumers.<\/p> <p>  The TLTRO, which the Deputy mentioned, are a potential option of which banks can avail if they wish to access that type of funding.  Certain conditions are attached and some of the Irish banks access that type of funding.

We provided an assessment to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in which we examined the shared equity scheme under a number of headings relating to our mandate for financial stability, our mandate for consumer protection and broader dynamics in the market.  As for the third heading, which related to pricing and affordability, our assessment was that the main problem in the market relates to a lack of supply, about which I think there is a general consensus.  We think the main effect of the shared equity scheme may be on demand and that while that may have some effect on supply, the effect may not be too great because there seems to be some sluggishness in how supply responds to demand.<\/p> <p>  We cannot yet provide an assessment regarding how great any impact on prices might be because we do not yet have enough information regarding the design of these measures.  We would need information on who the measures could apply to, whether there would be particular thresholds or caps on the measures and whether they would apply to certain cohorts.  Until we have more details, we will not be able to provide any quantification on supply.<\/p> <p>  Whether house prices should be taken into consideration in the assessment of price stability is a very topical, important and relevant issue.  The Central Bank of Ireland, of course, is part of the euro system and we contribute to its monetary policy.  The ECB is currently undertaking a fundamental review of its monetary policy strategy.  It will be a very comprehensive review of many different areas.  One key element will examine whether owner-occupied housing should be included in the measurement of the price basket when ECB takes decisions regarding price stability.  It is too early to say what the outcome will be in that respect - the findings are expected to be announced during the second half of this year - but the issue is under active consideration as part of that stability review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I have one more question in the brief time that remains in my slot.  It relates to climate change.  In previous years, the ECB and the central banks it co-ordinates have often had too great a focus on price stability, unlike the US Federal Reserve, which also has a focus on creating full employment.  The president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, recently stated that climate change affects all the bank's policy areas and that a new climate change unit has been established.  This decision, an ECB press release stated, \"reflects the growing importance of climate change for the economy\".  It seems to tie in with the EU's efforts to initiate a green new deal with a just transition, which is necessary if Europe is to reach its targets.<\/p><p>It is clear that in order to do this, massive investment is required in green technology.  Economists working in the climate area argue that spending of 2.5% of GDP on green investment and just transition is required but our Minister for Finance is arguing that we must start to reduce our spending and reduce our rate of borrowing.  At the same time, the T&aacute;naiste has been warning that inflation is about to take off, despite the fact that the EU has spent the past decade fighting deflation.  Does the Central Bank accept that EU states must have access to the kind of funding required for large-scale green investment projects and that it is necessary to increase investment in these technologies if the EU is to come anywhere close to reaching its targets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00900","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions, the response to which I will break down into a couple of different elements.  Deputy Farrell mentioned that a new climate change unit has been set up at the ECB.  I can confirm that we have done the same within the Central Bank in Dublin.  That reflects the importance of climate change, including for central banks; this is not just something that we are looking out at in the rest of the economy.  Climate change has a significant impact on the mandate of central banks, including through potential risks or impacts on price stability through its effects on the real economy, as well as its potential effects on financial stability, perhaps through the exposure of banks or insurance companies.  We are directly interested and are taking our responsibilities in that regard very seriously.  There is also the extent to which the central banking community in the euro system should be commenting on more general economic issues around central banking or taking that into consideration in our monetary policy decisions.  I am sorry to be giving a similar answer to the previous one but this is under active consideration in the current ECB strategy review.  What I can say is that the mandate of the ECB is very clear, namely that the primary concern is price stability.  The secondary objective, without prejudice to price stability, is to take action to support the general economic policies of the EU which would include climate change.  There is an indirect opportunity there, as long as it does not conflict with the primary objective of price stability which remains paramount.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the politics, I will not comment on the political dimension apart from agreeing with the fundamental importance of capital expenditure to mitigate risks relating to climate change.

In addition to the direct effect on sovereign borrowing costs, there is the effect on lending costs of financial institutions, which depend more than anything on those sovereign yields.  The third effect is that the ECB's monetary policy is having a positive impact on the economic performance of the euro area as a whole and we benefit, in a secondary way, through spillovers from that positive growth.  That is currently having a very significant effect and we published some analysis of that yesterday.  The analysis shows that for both Ireland and the euro area, the results are roughly similar.  Output this year is around 1.5% higher than it would be in the absence of this monetary policy.<\/p> <p>  I have just outlined the actions that have already been taken.  What I would say about the recovery period is that the ECB is committed to ensuring that this accommodative monetary policy remains in place.  The asset purchases will continue until at least March 2022 and longer, if necessary.  Similarly, the guidance is that the interest rate environment will remain low until the recovery is established.  It is very clear, through the monetary policy to which we contribute, that we are having and will continue to have a significant effect.<\/p> <p>  Our other responsibility is in the area of providing economic analysis and comment.  Our public comments with regard to the public finances are very supportive of the idea that additional policy measures are required and that there is a role for fiscal policy in supporting the recovery, enhancing the productive capacity and reducing the scarring effects.  We are very supportive of Government actions in that regard.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>In the aftermath of the shut down, there is likely to be a rapid recovery for the countries that are first to lift restrictions.

Hopefully, this recovery will come about in a somewhat different fashion to the recovery following the last economic crash.  It has been indicated to various committees in recent weeks that the banking sector will develop the means to assess the viability of small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  I am not sure this is necessarily the best approach because it puts the assessment in the hands of the banks instead of the customer.  It is necessary to take into account the views of those who have set up and maintained businesses and kept people in employment in both good times and bad in recent years.  To what extent will the Central Bank be in a position to encourage the lenders to take account of the expertise in the SME sector, as opposed to what happened in the aftermath of the economic crash?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#C01000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We were in a very different situation with the recovery the last time.  We have a much stronger banking system now, much healthier public finances, lower indebtedness and the structure of the economy is much better placed to recover.<\/p><p>We are also in a situation where the Government can put money into the economy during a downturn as opposed to the need to take it out of the economy during the downturn, which was the situation last year because our borrowing costs had risen to levels which, frankly, nobody was willing to lend us money at, and which compares with a situation now where we are borrowing for ten years at effectively 0%.<\/p><p> The viability of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, will be a critical issue on the path to recovery of this economy.  It is clear that there are a lot of SMEs that are experiencing considerable losses at the same time that they would be structurally fundamentally sound when the economy begins.  That, of course, is the rationale for the Government supports to the SME sector which are extremely important.  Much of the distress will not become evident until after those supports are removed and that is when public policy reaches a critical juncture.  Certainly, public policy will have to make decisions with regard to the balance between ongoing support for the sector versus trying to assess viability and trying to support new emerging sectors.<\/p><p> With regard to the Central Bank's role in this, I suppose we engage at a supervisory level with the banks.  It is important for them to make quality risk assessments so as not to be putting their own funds in jeopardy.  At the same time, we also discuss with banks the bigger picture.  The economy as a whole does not benefit if there is to be undue closing of small and medium-sized enterprises.  It is in nobody's interest for the economy as a whole to be affected negatively as a result.  Therefore, it is important that banks also take into consideration the larger picture in making decisions.  I am not involved in the supervisory area.  Personally, I cannot say anything more about that engagement, except to agree with what Deputy Durkan says.  As a general comment, there are many small and medium-sized enterprises that are a significant part of society and community and they need to be considered as such rather than in the narrow financial contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Have I ten minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Nine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming.<\/p> <p>  This is a genuine question.

For the economy generally, clearly we are hoping for the scenario, that I think people now expect, whereby the vaccines get successfully rolled out during the second half of the year and are effective in combatting the virus.  Anything where that does not materialise is the greatest short-term risk for the economy.<\/p> <p>  Over the longer term, and this is getting also into the policy dimension, there are a number of challenges for Government policy.  First of all, one will see additional financial pressures for the Exchequer from ageing, particularly as and from 2040, and also in relation to climate change.  There is a draft Bill today which will include intermediate or secondary targets for before 2050.  There are many medium-term pressures in the public finances that need to be considered now.  They would be difficult to deal with if they are not addressed now.<\/p> <p>  In addition, Ireland is a small, open economy.  We are always more vulnerable to shocks to the external environment than other countries and that remains the case.  I would note maybe two of those in particular.  First, we have a high degree of reliance on corporation taxes paid by foreign multinationals.  It is welcome that we receive these corporation taxes but there are risks to those because there is quite a high degree of concentration in a small number of sectors and small number of firms.  There is also an international process under the OECD in terms of changes to international taxation arrangements and it is acknowledged that Ireland could lose some of its current tax revenues as a result of that process.  Risks relating to the external environment, multinationals and SMEs are important.<\/p> <p>  I suppose a third concern is that while the public finances remain in a generally favourable position and they can absorb the additional expenditures that will be required this year and perhaps after to alleviate the current costs of the restrictions because of Covid but also to help the economy recover, we still have a high level of public sector debt and a high level of public sector debt leaves an economy more vulnerable to unforeseen shocks that might come down the line.  For that reason more than any, a key element of our policy advice is when conditions allow - I emphasise that part because we are not currently in that state - it will be essential to return the public sector debt ratio to a lower, more sustainable level than the current level which is approximately 100% of national income.  Economic growth will do most of the heavy lifting in that regard but at the same time there is a need to think about a path to return the Government balance to a more sustainable situation that is compatible with a lower debt ratio.  Those are just some of the concerns that come to mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Have I time left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D01300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The Deputy has almost three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D01400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>This is a general question and I do not need a particularly long answer.

The people want to know that austerity is off the table and they are not going to be asked to pay the bill this time because it would be grossly unfair and counterproductive, as clearly was the case in previous cuts to areas such as healthcare, housing and education.  In the context of Covid, one thinks about the price that we are paying for the cuts and lack of investment in areas such as those.

Current Government policies are considerably reducing the costs and hardships of the crisis.  We saw that in some data we published recently where average wages would have declined and, in fact, average incomes in the economy increased last year due to the impact of Government supports.  That contribution was greater for lower-income groups.  Government policies have already had a positive effect.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is asking about the forward-looking situation, once the temporary supports that are now in place are removed and a recovery is under way.  The Deputy mentioned public sector investment.  Experience shows that it is extremely unwise for an economy to cut back on capital investment following an economic crisis because that has negative effects on the productive capacity of an economy in the long run.  That is a key lesson and a mistake was made in the past in that respect.  In Ireland, we did not have too much choice because we could not afford to borrow money at the time but investment certainly fell significantly here and elsewhere after the most recent crisis.  That has had significant negative effects.<\/p> <p>  Our advice and recommendation is that, first of all, current temporary policies remain necessary and they need not be removed prematurely.  When they are removed, attention needs to be focused on the recovery of the economy.  What will be most important there will be measures that reduce scarring effects, particularly long-term unemployment.  There will be structural changes.  In many ways, the economy will go back to where it was before but not fully.  There will be changes in consumer preferences, tastes and habits that have been picked up during the crisis that will be permanent.  We will have changes in commuting patterns because of working from home and that will have structural effects on the economy.  What policy can do there is to try to gear the economy towards the new reality, including the retraining and upskilling of people.  That is a significant way in which policy can have a positive effect.<\/p> <p>  I earlier mentioned enhancing the productive capacity of the economy.  In terms of paying the bill for Covid, I also mentioned the fact that we think the current situation is sustainable.  We do not think there is any need for what is commonly called austerity, albeit that can mean different things to different people.  Austerity is certainly not required to a degree whereby demand is removed from the economy at a time when the recovery is not established.  We firmly believe that when the time is right, public sector debt will need to return.  We think that economic growth will do much of the heavy lifting in that respect and that is another reason to emphasise the importance of capital investment.

I know that the Central Bank produces reports on wealth and its distribution.  The Oxfam report, The Inequality Virus, states that, in Ireland and globally, huge numbers of ordinary people have lost jobs and incomes and have really suffered while a significant cohort of billionaires, the super wealthy and certain industries with which they are associated have done extraordinarily well and have seen their wealth increase significantly.  That is true in Ireland.  The report states that the wealth of Ireland's billionaires has increased by &euro;3.3 billion.  Has Dr. Cassidy any comment on that?

This is very important.  The European Commission issued an initial review of the framework in February.  Progress on that has understandably stalled since the pandemic has taken up attention, but it pointed to certain weaknesses in the fiscal framework from a backward-looking perspective.  Fiscal policies were often pro-cyclical and the composition of public finances was not as growth enhancing or encouraging of investment, including sustainable investment, as it might be.  The complexity of the fiscal framework, particularly in relation to matters such as structural balances which are very difficult to calculate and are largely outside Government control, is another issue.  The Government can decide how much it will spend but not necessarily how much it will take in.  These are all potential areas, flagged by the European Commission, where there will be some changes to the framework in future.<\/p> <p>  I cannot be too definitive because these are inherently political matters, but the simplicity versus the complexity of the framework should be considered.  Simpler rules on expenditure would be one option, rather than a focus on balances.  There is a certain degree of one size fits all when it comes to assessment of debt which focuses on a single figure - the debt ratio.  A broader understanding of an individual country's debt situation, the sustainability of its finances, and a distinction between good debt and bad debt is necessary.  Good debt is accrued for capital and environmental investment versus bad debt which is not productive.  Looking at what is underlying the debt and the sentiment of financial markets to further increases in debt are other issues.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues and an appetite for change in certain areas.  However, there are political issues and some countries will be more resistant to changes than others, so I do not know what the reality will be.

Regarding the short term, we published projections for inflation and the outlook is for it to remain modest in the coming years.  The announcements of the European Central Bank, ECB, on how long it expects to support monetary policy, both interest rates and asset purchases which put further downward pressure on Government borrowing costs, have clearly noted that support of an accommodative policy will remain in place for a while.  The asset purchases and interest rate will remain until at least March 2022 and possibly longer, depending on Covid.  The ECB projections are for inflation to be still below the global target of close to 2% by the end of its forecast horizon of 2023.<\/p> <p>  We do not expect to see the trends of higher inflation and higher interest rates in the short term.  Some of the risks of higher interest rates have been mitigated by the bond issuance of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which leaves our maturities and need to roll over debt in a very favourable position.  However, it is also the case that inflation and interest rates will increase at some stage.  The resilience of the economy will depend on how well placed it will be to withstand that.  I point particularly to the increase in interest rates.  If public sector debt is high, and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council published a useful document on this recently, there is significantly more vulnerability to higher interest rates when they occur.  At some stage, they will occur although I certainly will not put a time frame on it.  It is important that the economy is well placed.

One of the policy interventions that was made last year was an intervention that my party and I have been calling for in the context of how we might deal with a potential no-deal Brexit.  I refer to the introduction of the initial temporary wage subsidy scheme, which has since evolved into the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Would Dr. Cassidy be of the view, given the exposure of the locally traded sector to the decline we have experienced and the clear challenges that certain economic sectors will face in re-establishing themselves, that we should, as a feature of the labour market, have embedded into our system a formal short-time working scheme equivalent, for example, to the that which operates very successfully in Germany and which supported jobs and businesses through the financial crash in the late 2000s and early 2010s?  Is this something he thinks we should consider, perhaps with a condition attached around training and upskilling?  We have a serious issue on our hands in terms of productivity and competitiveness for SMEs and an ongoing challenge in the context of upskilling and retraining.

The T&aacute;naiste, as far as I am aware, did not put a timeframe on this.

I must just make that point.<\/p> <p>  What the Deputy is suggesting in terms of the wage subsidy scheme evolving into something more permanent is worth consideration.  He is talking about something that can reduce the risk that arises when a crisis happens and workers become disengaged from a firm for a period.  It may only be temporary but such a disengagement leads to longer-lasting effects.  There are potential schemes that could be used.  The EWSS was introduced, obviously, for temporary purposes, but the rationale behind it could potentially be considered as something more permanent.  I would not want to get into it any further than that except to agree with the Deputy that there is a lot of merit in what he is saying for reasons that relate to maintaining skills, motivation and engagement.  If a worker leaves a firm, even only temporarily, it becomes much more difficult to re-engage that individual.

We must, first of all, try to ensure that the skills exist for those to develop, whether in the areas of data, IT, management and so on.  That type of upskilling is needed.

First, it certainly is the case that multinational contribute significantly.  Their contribution is extremely welcome.  There are some issues in regard to the measurement of their output, but they contribute in a very real and meaningful way to export, employment and the public finances and also in terms of positive spillovers, including technology spillovers that help to upskill workers.  The multinationals make an extremely positive contribution but our output figures show quite a degree of reliance.  When that is the case, we need to look at whether the economy would be resilient in the event of either a firm-specific shock - we should keep in mind that a small number of firms dominate output in many of these sectors - or a sector-specific shock in a context where, for example, the pharmaceutical sector and the IT services sector dominate.  We need to ensure that we would be resilient in such an event.  We are not anticipating any reduction in the size of the multinational enterprise, MNE, sector but we want to be resilient because there is always a risk.<\/p> <p>  There are three things that need to be taken into consideration from a policy perspective.  First, policies need to remain supportive of the multinational sector.  We must remain a good place for multinationals to do business.  Most of these sectors have been embedded in the economy for a long time.  They are here for the long run and we need to make sure we remain a favourable location for business.  Second, we need to make sure that, complementary to the MNE sector, there is a successful Irish-owned sector.  It is indigenous SMEs that provide most of the employment - up to 1 million people - in this economy.  There are issues in this regard.  There is significantly weaker productivity among Irish-owned firms than there is among multinational firms.  Policy needs to ensure that we also have a productive, innovative and expanding indigenous sector.<\/p> <p>  The third point relates to corporation taxes.  We have developed a very high degree of reliance on those taxes.  I understand that 20% of our overall tax revenues now relate to corporation taxes, which is extremely high by historical standards.  That revenue source is dominated by multinationals and it means that if there were to be any shock to the overall balance between revenues and expenditure, it could be a shock akin to what happened when we had a degree of reliance on the construction sector back in the 2000s.  We need to ensure that our public finances are not overly reliant on the tax revenues from multinationals and that we do not make decisions about permanent spending increases based upon revenues from corporation taxes that could turn out not to be sustainable over the long term.  Again, I am not making a prediction in that regard.  It is just about being prudent in terms of management.  I would point to those policy areas in response to the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#G00900","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy for his presentation and for his informative responses to members' questions.<\/p><p>There are two or three areas I would like to tease out further.

Has he a measure of those harder hit sectors and the difficulty those people are experiencing, in particular in meeting their mortgages?

Let me deal with those three issues in turn.  The first question highlights a clear gap in terms of people's experience during the crisis.  For those people who have not been directly affected by any income losses, what they have generally experienced is a significant increase in their savings, largely because they have not had the opportunities to spend because outlets have been closed down and, in fact, in the past year savings have increased by around &euro;15 billion.  We think there is now a significant stock of savings that will be important in terms of supporting the recovery when it happens.  On the other hand, there are many sectors of the economy very negatively affected, particularly those reliant on face-to-face contact, such as hospitality, large parts of retail and arts and entertainment.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the analysis of this.  We have done something on this and we published it last year.  First, the losses have been significantly mitigated by the effect of the Government supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Given that, for most of these small enterprises, wages represent a very large amount of their costs, this has reduced the potential cost.  At the same time, they also have significant non-wage costs and many SMEs have experienced losses on those.  Our estimates are that SMEs last year would have experienced overall losses of roughly between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion, which is very significant.  We think the Government measures had a significant effect but the other estimate that we have published is that, even allowing for the supports, close to 15%, or just over one sixth of SMEs, are unlikely to have the financial capacity to meet their liabilities during 2021.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, bringing all of that together, while the Government supports have had a significant effect, significant losses have been incurred by many SMEs, including many viable SMEs and many SMEs which came into this crisis in a good financial position.  However, if they are closed for 12 months of the year, of course, they are going to incur losses.  Those are the estimates that we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I take the point on the SMEs.

There were two reasons for that.  First, a large part of the population are not affected directly by the crisis and, in fact, average incomes for that part of the population generally increased.  More remarkable has been the effect of the Government income supports.  Particularly for lower income workers and younger workers, the supports received from the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment have significantly reduced the financial hardship, although not in all cases and there have still been some income cuts among some parts.<\/p> <p>  I have some figures to hand.

However, in the same paper where we look at income, we also look at debt sustainability.  It shows that debt ratios have increased in many cases but, in fact, they have increased much less than they would have in the absence of supports.  I would emphasise that a lot of the issues will only become visible and evident once the supports are removed.  Once the supports are removed and the recovery starts, if there are people who do not return to work, and there will be people who do not return to work, for that cohort, that is when we may see the pressures on debt sustainability and mortgage arrears.  For that reason, we would expect to see some adverse impact on mortgage arrears arising from this pandemic, even if the figures are not yet visible because of the effect of income supports.  I would in no way want to sound complacent about what the lasting effects will be.<\/p> <p>  In terms of EU budgetary rules, I would not comment on what is appropriate but there is much to be considered.  There have been issues raised, first, that the current framework is overly complex; second, that it is not sufficiently supportive of growth and capital investment; and, third, that it is a little bit one-size-fits-all and does not take into account that a country's debt ratio is not the only metric one needs to look at.  There is also what that debt represents, whether it is debt that has been accrued because of capital; what does the market think regarding the sustainability of that debt; and, more important than anything else, what is the financing cost of that debt.  A 100% debt ratio at 0% interest is a lot better situation than a 100% debt ratio at 3% or 4% interest.<\/p> <p>  Those are the issues.  The process was paused last February when the European Commission first reported on the budgetary rules and, of course, the Stability and Growth Pact escape clause has been triggered and that will be extended for a while.  After the recovery starts, I think there is an opportunity to look again at the fiscal framework.  There is scope there but it is a political issue as to what changes will actually materialise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of interest rates and inflation, all I would say is that we do not see them increasing markedly in the near term, and I think there are reasons for that.  With regard to interest rates, the ECB is on the record as saying it expects its current asset purchases and its low interest rate environment to be in place for a while.

We use our economic modelling techniques to show the extent of that.  Our results show that an increase of that order, approximately &euro;5 billion or &euro;5.5 billion, would, if not funded, lead to a permanent increase in the general government deficit of approximately 1.5 percentage points.

That is very important and we see that when we expect the budget deficit to reduce to 4% next year.  That is because of an assumption that these temporary measures will not be in place and it shows how they are removed.  That is why we feel very confident in supporting the temporary measures that have been introduced.  They are affordable.  We think we will need to see a reduction in the public sector debt ratio at the right time.  We think economic growth will bear the brunt of that.  We think any policies that would restrict growth in the future, therefore, would be counterproductive.  We think, in addition to the impact of economic growth, that that budget balance will need to get down to balance and, if the economy gets back to full employment, ideally something of a small surplus.  The public finance position, the general government balance position, in addition to debt, will be important for that.

That contrasts significantly with other European countries, which saw roughly zero or even a fall in capital investment, so the evidence of the lessons having been learned here is quite apparent.

There will be requirements regarding how that money will be disbursed when we receive it.  There will be a need to take into consideration expenditure on climate-related matters.  Approximately 35% or 40% may need to go on climate.  There will also be a need to take into consideration productive investment, fairness and macro-stabilisation.  Essentially, the funding is for investment recovery and enhancing long-term potential, which is extremely appropriate.  In terms of the economic framework of the EU, measures that can enhance investment and improve environmental sustainability will be very appropriate.  I am not sure to what extent that would make its way to SMEs.  The &euro;1 billion I was talking about will be in the form of grants.

We heard this week that because of Ireland's GDP and our measurement of the economy in that way, we are going to receive fewer of those grants than we might otherwise be able to draw down.  During this session Dr. Cassidy outlined the three points relating to corporation tax - they are very good points - namely, that Ireland should remain a good place to do business, that we should have a successful indigenous sector and that we should not rely too much on corporation tax.  It seems, however, that while Ireland is losing out on those grants, the argument is that we are getting it back in corporation tax.  There is a qualitative difference between receiving corporation tax and being part of that recovery fund and those grants.  The first point about Ireland remaining a good place to do business is now working against the second, namely, to foster a successful indigenous sector.

As a result of the presence of multinationals, it is well recognised that our headline GDP is overstated as a measure of the incomes of the economy.  GDP is probably in the region of 40% higher than GNI, which is what we get when we adjust for some of the practices of multinationals that relate to depreciation of intellectual property, depreciation of aircraft leasing and what is called contract manufacturing.  These are activities that do not really contribute to the Irish economy, but they do add to the headline GDP.  One impact of that is exactly what the Chairman mentioned, which is that it sometimes means our contributions or receipts to and from the EU are affected because the denominator is GDP rather than GNI*.  I have heard what the Chairman is describing in terms of what we receive but consider, for example, something rather simple.  If a country's contribution to the European Union is a percentage of its national income, and if GDP is used for Ireland, we are paying a much higher share than if GNI* was used.  It is the case that our contributions to, and in some cases returns from, the EU can be affected because of this measurement issue of national income.  I would not deny to that extent but in considering the contribution of multinationals, while corporation tax is important, it is only one element.  It is not just exports.  The overall multinational sector employs more than 350,000 people.  These are high-skilled jobs with above average wages.  They create a demand for skilled work and they have other spillovers in the environment and in local communities and also in terms of productivity and innovation technology.  The benefits from the multinational sector are much greater and more intrinsic than just corporation tax.

I am not sure what that assessment of viability will be.  It will not be the Central Bank that will make a viability assessment.  I am not sure what it will entail.  In a way it is too early.  I am aware that this is not a very satisfactory answer because, ideally, we would be able to design and consider future policies now, but we do not know how we will come out of the crisis.  For example, we do not know how spending patterns will change, which would mean that some of the temporary effects from the crisis may be sustained over time.  Some businesses that may have been viable going into the crisis may not be viable over the longer term.  Getting the balance right between, on the one hand, ensuring viable business, which is certainly for the economic benefit of the State, versus, on the other, keeping alive businesses that will not be viable over the longer term by allocating resources to those businesses that could be allocated elsewhere.  That is an extremely difficult balance to achieve.<\/p> <p>  In the first instance, there is a widespread recognition that many of the firms which have suffered significant losses and increases in debt during the crisis are viable and that the latter is just down to their businesses has been locked down temporarily, albeit for more than a year in many cases.

There are measures under consideration such as lighter, more flexible examinership procedures that could help in that regard.  Policies will look, first, at continuing supports and how they might need to be adjusted and, second, in terms of potential restructuring procedures in the economy.

For example, we could say that all property is inflated in terms of price and that all property is market related and, as we know from the economic crash, its value suddenly disappear.

There is a couple of different elements to that.  The first would be a distinction I would make between national income and national wealth in the same way that a household will have its annual income and also its annual wealth.  When we talk about GNI, GDP and all of these measures they relate to income so they relate to how much an economy is producing or, alternatively, how much an economy is spending or earning within a year.  They do not include factors of wealth such as assets, housing or the like.  We have very good cross-country comparisons on income.  We have very poor cross-country comparisons on wealth because it is very difficult to compare many of the assets an economy might have in order to put a figure on those.  I might restrict the answer to income, which is what these measures relate to, and say two things about them.  We published something on this recently by our previous Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, which looks at different measures of income that are used and how each may not be appropriate and can give very misleading results.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, if we look at GDP, which is what most economists around the world use, Ireland comes out as the richest country, in income terms, in the European Union and the fifth richest in the world.  That is entirely misleading and it is because GDP is inflated by some factors relating to the multinational sectors that in no way benefit the incomes of the Irish economy.  If we look at alternative measures just for those, we are probably around eighth highest in the European Union.  That is probably a reasonably meaningful comparison.<\/p> <p>  Professor Honohan also looked at what happens if we adjust that for the prices people pay.  Two countries may have the same incomes but one may be paying twice as much for its goods and services, and even for housing costs within a year, than another.  Ireland has an extremely high price level compared with other European countries, so if we adjust for the price level, again, we are down around eighth to 12th in the European Union, which is more meaningful.<\/p> <p>  I would make one other point on that.  National income is purely a financial and monetary concept.  There are also broader measures of welfare which are extremely important to take into consideration.  They may also reflect health, education and measures of well-being and happiness within an economy.  These are more difficult to measure.  They may be more representative of welfare in one country compared with another.  There is one such measure that Professor Honohan's publication mentioned, which is a United Nations human development indicator.  It includes all of these and when that is properly measured for Ireland, again, we are somewhere around the middle of the pack in terms of measurement compared with other European countries.  My apologies for going back and forth with a couple of different concepts in respect of measurement but I hope what I said goes towards answering the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>It gives me an idea.

If prices are increasing fuelled by a lending boom - a credit boom - and people are purchasing houses not out of the income they are earning in work but are borrowing to do so and we get the same dynamic that we saw in the 2000s, and if there is a fixed supply of housing or housing that is increasing somewhat, people are borrowing more, which puts upward pressure on prices and means that other people coming after them have to borrow more again.  I suppose that price credit dynamic is what we would be most concerned with and we have very clear evidence from the past about what that can lead to.<\/p> <p>  The second comment I would make is that there is clearly an issue with regard to affordability of housing at the moment.

This represents an increase of &euro;82 million or 4% over the 2020 Further Revised Estimate.  In addition, my Department has a further &euro;4.1 million allocation for capital carryover.<\/p> <p>  While my Department continues to have responsibility for policy, legislation and services in respect of children and young people, we have taken on a significantly expanded role since October last with the transfer of additional functions from the Department of Justice.  We continue our existing important functions in the areas of child protection and welfare, prevention and early intervention, adoption, family supports, early learning and childcare, youth services and youth justice.  In addition, we now have the additional major areas of equality, integration, international protection and disability policy.  I very much welcome these added functions, and the opportunities they present to create a more blended, cohesive approach across the various areas of Government policy affected.  Further, very significant additional functions will be added during 2021 when responsibility for disability services transfers from the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the past year has been exceptional due to the challenges of Covid-19.  I would like to start by acknowledge the significant impact that the pandemic has had on the work of my Department and its agencies.  The early learning and care sector, Tusla, youth services and international protection accommodation have been particularly affected.<\/p> <p>  Tusla continues to deliver front-line services despite the need for level 5 restrictions.  The early learning and childcare sector has worked hard, and I am pleased that we have been able to facilitate a phased reopening of the sector in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  In the area of accommodation for international protection seekers, we have continued to adapt to ensure that users of facilities are properly protected.  This has involved identifying processes and resources including the provision of separate accommodation to prevent and deal with outbreaks of the virus; reallocating shared accommodation to reduce the number of residents sharing rooms; the purchase of PPE; enabling older residents to cocoon; and deploying staffing resources to meet the increased workload.<\/p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts made across the whole of our sector in response to the pandemic.  It has been an extremely challenging time and this year will require similar intensive efforts to combat the impact of Covid.<\/p> <p>  Turning to my Department&rsquo;s Vote, we have provided the select committee with details of the funding allocations across the different programme areas, along with a summary by subhead, including details of changes over the 2020 figures.  In terms of Vote spending, three areas on the vote represent some 89% of the Department's allocation, namely, Tusla, at 45%, early years programmes and schemes, at 33%, and asylum accommodation accounting for 11% of the overall allocation.  I will now briefly address these areas in turn.<\/p> <p>  My Department's Estimate contains provision of &euro;858 million for Tusla, an increase of &euro;19 million or 2% over the 2020 final allocation.<\/p><p>However, the increase in allocation as represented in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, figures does not reflect the additional funding secured in the Further Revised Estimate, FRE, in 2020, which was an additional &euro;21.5 million, the transfer of education welfare services out to Vote 26, which was down &euro;35 million, or the movement of funding from subhead B7 to subhead A3 for 2021 in respect of prevention and early intervention, which was an additional &euro;9.5 million.<br\/><br\/>There is also an additional &euro;5 million in the 2021 Estimates for unaccompanied minor refugees.  When these elements are taken into account, the comparable year-on-year funding increase to Tusla amounts to &euro;66 million.  In recent years, Tusla has experienced an increased demand for its services, with significant budgetary pressures resulting.  The 2021 budget addresses these challenges.  It includes substantial increases to address deficits in a number of key areas, including private residential care.  It will allow Tusla to support partners in the community and voluntary sector in responding to Covid and service demands, particularly in the area of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, services.  It includes &euro;5 million to support the agency to meet international commitments to transfer more unaccompanied minor refugees to Ireland.  We will provide Tusla with the resources required to meet existing and anticipated levels of demand for its services in 2021.<br\/><br\/>Another significant portion of my Department's spending is on early learning and care, which has an overall allocation of &euro;638 million, broadly in line with the original 2020 allocation.  Funding in 2021 allows my Department to continue to meet the cost of the two-year early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and allow for additional funding of &euro;3.6 million under the access and inclusion model, AIM, which supports children with additional needs to access the ECCE programme.  The allocation for the national childcare scheme, NCS, will meet the costs of delivering the scheme and support the sustainability and operation of the early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC, sector in the current challenging environment.  The funding provided in 2021 will also provide for the full-year cost of the increase to the standard and enhanced NCS hours, from 15 hours to 20 hours and from 40 hours to 45 hours, respectively, introduced in September 2020.  I have prioritised a number of initiatives to improve ELC and SAC quality, including additional funding for the early years inspectorate, the Better Start and childminding initiatives, and for the ongoing roll-out of the First 5 strategy.  I have provided additional funding of &euro;5.7 million under subhead B5 for these and service delivery costs.<br\/><br\/>The area of accommodation under our international protection services has seen an increase of just over &euro;17 million in 2021.  In fact, when compared to the original 2020 allocation of &euro;81 million under the Department of Justice Vote, the 2021 allocation of &euro;218 million represents an increase of &euro;137 million.  We have seen a significant increase in the numbers applying for international protection in recent years.  The total capacity has increased by 19.6% from the end of 2018 to the end of 2020.  Much of this increase in capacity has been met through the provision of emergency accommodation, which has been contracted on rolling short-term contracts and which has proven to be much more expensive than designated accommodation centres under long-term contract.  The increased demand has stretched the capacity of existing dedicated centres and we had an unwelcome reliance on other premises such as hotels and guest houses to provide accommodation on a short-term basis.  We want to cease the use of emergency facilities as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>Members will be aware that the programme for Government contains a commitment to end direct provision.  I was very pleased to publish the Government's White Paper last month, setting out a new ambitious Government policy to replace direct provision.  The 2021 allocation will fund planning for implementation of the new system of accommodation and supports envisaged in the White Paper.  I am determined to replace the current system with one that respects the dignity of those seeking international protection.  In the meantime, the funding for 2021 will support the current system as we phase it out.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the rest of the Vote, there are a number of policy areas that will be progressed in 2021.  My Department is urgently working on information and tracing legislation to allow access to birth information for adopted persons, including the birth certificate.  My Department is also working on the implementation of an action plan in response to the recommendations in the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  In this regard I have just launched a consultation process on the development of an <i>ex gratia<\/i>restorative recognition scheme for former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes.  The scheme will form part of the Government's comprehensive response to the commission's final report.<br\/><br\/>The 2021 Estimate will allow my Department to continue to provide funding in the important areas of equality, disability and integration.  These are very important and challenging areas and the Vote contains funding streams for areas such as the National Disability Authority, refugee and migrant integration, gender equality, LGBTI+ and Traveller and Roma initiatives.<br\/><br\/>The 2021 Estimate has seen an increase of &euro;5 million for youth services to some &euro;70 million.  This level of funding will support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector.  The youth sector is essential to reach and address the most marginalised and vulnerable young people.<br\/><br\/>I believe that the significant increase in resources under my Department's Vote for 2021 allows for the continuation of vital services to some of our most disadvantaged communities and a number of important opportunities for a targeted development and improvement of services.  I will continue to work closely with all sectors and stakeholders as we strive to maximise outcomes from the resources being considered today.  I thank members for their attention and I will be pleased to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#A00700","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much.

We have spoken a number of times about the increase in domestic violence during the pandemic or perhaps it is the case that it was highlighted more during the pandemic.  It is very welcome that additional funding was ring-fenced for that, in particular for helplines operated by Women's Aid and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre just before Christmas.  Does the Minister expect the funding to continue?  From his discussions with those in the sector, do they feel the funding is adequate or do they need an increase?  I would welcome the Minister's comments in that regard.  For the first time in Irish society, people are a lot more educated on domestic violence and perhaps how to identify if a friend or family member is in need.  It would be great if the funding could continue.<\/p> <p>  Do we have an idea of the number of children with disabilities currently availing of the AIM programme?  Does the Minister consider that it is working?  Are we seeing an increase in children with disabilities since AIM has come into the system or do we need to look at that?<\/p> <p>  One issue has been raised a number of times.  Given last year's lockdown and the situation this year, has consideration been given to providing additional time for children under the ECCE scheme?

Is there a possibility that will happen?<\/p> <p>  Subhead D relates to positive actions for gender equality.  We are in the evaluation period of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.

We secured a very significant increase in DSGBV funding.  Additional money went to Tusla and it then allocated significant additional funding.  Additional core funding of &euro;2.7 million was provided, bringing the core funding for the DSGBV area up to &euro;28 million.  An additional Covid contingency fund of &euro;2 million was also provided for this year considering the particular pressures which the Chairman identified the DSGBV services as being under.  I would like to continue to grow the amount of funding we provide on a capital level to DSGBV services.<\/p><p>The Chairman is absolutely right.  One of the very few benefits of Covid for the country has been to lift the lid on the levels of DSGBV taking place across the country.  We need to respond to that through the provision of services.  We also need to respond through the provision of other means.  As the Chairman is aware, Tusla is undertaking a review of accommodation at the moment.  By April or May, we will get the result of that, which will be very important in guiding our future investment in infrastructure throughout the country.  I am conscious that it is difficult to get capital funding for additional DSGBV services in new locations.  I want to look at that issue.  As the Chairman knows, there is wider responsibility for DSGBV services across Departments and Government agencies.  That is something we committed to in the programme for Government.  It is being led by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, but I have also been feeding into it.  <\/p><p> Work is ongoing on the provision of paid domestic violence leave and benefit recognising that poverty is often one of the main barriers preventing someone from fleeing a situation of domestic violence.  It would be very beneficial to provide some kind of paid leave so that people can escape these situations.<\/p><p> Returning to the core of the Chairman's question, I want to see continued increase in current expenditure.  I will continue to engage with the sector.  I have met many of the groups since I became Minister.  I have met representatives of Safe Ireland, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and others on a number of occasions.  I will continue my engagement on those points.<\/p><p> Regarding ECCE, we have seen that AIM has been an incredibly successful programme.  That is why we have been able to allocate an additional &euro;3.6 million this year to broaden it.  After three years of AIM being operational, we will carry out a root-and-branch review of it.  Certainly, the sense is that it has been an extremely successful programme.  Obviously, it provides specific benefits to a wide range of children and allows them to access the ECCE programme.  I would love to be able to provide supports for children also accessing early learning and care outside the ECCE format.  I would like to look at that.  We want AIM to continue to grow, which is why we have provided additional funding to it this year.  <\/p><p> The issue of an additional third ECCE year for children is a difficult one.  We have engaged very extensively with the National Disability Authority, NDA, on the wider question of the early age exception.  The NDA has always been very clear in its official guidance to us that children leaving childcare settings and going into the primary setting should do so with their own age group.  Its position is that unless there are very exceptional circumstances, that transition should go with the year group and we all know the importance of those transitions.  That has not changed in light of Covid.  We are not considering a large-scale provision of a third year of ECCE at this point.  <\/p><p> In the next two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the steering committee of the national strategy for women and girls.  That has been extremely important in influencing Government policy.  We recently published the research paper on period poverty, which is very significant.  That has at least been able to provide a context for a discussion on the issue of period poverty and the Seanad is addressing a number of Bills relating to the provision of period products.  I recently issued a directive to all direct provision centres requiring them to provide free period products to everybody in direct provision.  That is just one example of the success of the national strategy for women and girls.  During this year we will review that strategy and plan to introduce a successor strategy focusing on many of the areas it highlighted, including the leadership role of women in politics, and other areas of business and society.  We will look to continue the progress that has been made so far.  <\/p><p> Have I covered all the Chairman's points?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#B00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Yes.

I thank the Minister for his contribution at the start.  I know the Chairman already spoke about domestic violence, which has been very prevalent.  In several meetings and engagements with community-based services, I have heard that they have seen an increase in the number of victims of domestic violence presenting.  I am talking about some of the non-traditional supports.  Those running youth services, for example, are hearing from young people who access their services that they see much more of it at home.  Those running the family resource centres have also highlighted an increase in it.  I ask the Minister to give an overview of the increase in expenditure in programme A.  How will that contribute to targeting the needs of victims of abuse?<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if this matter comes under the Minister's remit and it may come under the Department of Justice but in response to a parliamentary question in November 2020, I was advised that more than 7,000 people had reported incidents of domestic abuse to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some 5,500 of them were women, but 1,500 of the people who reported domestic abuse were men.  I am aware that there is a programme for perpetrators of domestic abuse called Choices, which is for men, but it is not available for women who are perpetrators of domestic abuse.  Does the Minister have any thoughts on that?  I am not sure if it is under his remit.  Are there any programmes for female perpetrators of domestic abuse?  As we know, victims of female abuse can often face a particular stigma due to female violence not fitting into society's norms.  Is there anything for that because it could help break the stigma?  <\/p> <p>  Today I had a meeting with representatives of Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, and BeLonG To to discuss some issues they have.  I notice that gender-based violence, trans issues, surrogacy, assisted human reproduction, online safety and the shortcomings of women's health screening are constant and have emerged as core issues over 2020 and 2021.  How is the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth keeping its finger on the pulse in respect of these issues?  <\/p> <p>  TENI also raised the issue of the access to services for young trans people who are looking for them, particularly access to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Seven recommendations were laid out in a report in 2020, none of which has been implemented yet.  Does the Minister have any feedback on that?  I appreciate that it might not come under his remit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#C00500","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about additional funding, which is related to a question the Chairman asked earlier.  Tusla got an increase of about &euro;66 million.  We have also allocated an additional &euro;4.7 million to services relating to domestic violence, of which &euro;2.7 million is core funding.  That gives it &euro;28 million in core funding.  We have also provided an additional &euro;2 million just for this year to meet Covid costs over the year.  It has total funding of &euro;30 million for this year, &euro;28 million of which is core funding that will be repeated in 2022.<\/p><p>I will be trying to grow that and I am committed to increased investment.  Domestic violence is being reported more.  I do not know if the incidence is increasing or if it is because people are coming forward more.  In any event, it is important that people have confidence to come forward.  We need to do more to make it easier for victims of domestic violence to come forward and to support them in doing so.<\/p><p> This ties in to the second question.  Members have probably heard of the O'Malley review into the journey of victims of sexual crime published late last year.  It was commenced subsequent to the Belfast rape trial and the discussion on how we treat victims of sexual crimes here.  That was a significant body of work undertaken by Mr. O'Malley.  The response to it is being led by the Department of Justice.  One element of involves Tusla, in conjunction with the HSE and the Department of Justice, mapping out the services that are available to victims of sexual crime.  Often this may include someone in circumstances of domestic violence.  That will not always be the case but it is certainly relevant.  The mapping exercise will be useful in identifying where there are gaps in service provision throughout the country.  There are 16 rape crisis centres but not all areas of the country are served to the same degree.  Getting that information will be important so that we can guide where we target resources in future.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the specific issue of male victims of domestic violence.  That is a significant issue and it is important that it is raised.  I met representatives of the charity representing male victims of domestic violence in January.  We had a useful discussion during which they raised the issue of programmes to support women.  The issue of female perpetrators of domestic violence was also raised.  I cannot remember the full details now but perhaps I can get back to the committee on it.  There is ongoing work in that area.  We support the NGO in question and recognise its important work.  Violence against men in a domestic setting should not be forgotten in this discussion.<\/p><p> It was great to hear of the engagement with the Transgender Equality Network Ireland and BeLonG To.  Both organisations are represented on the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy committee.  I chair the co-ordinating committee of that group.  We had a useful meeting last week.  The strategy is divided into different pillars.  Last week's pillar covered safety and society.  Among the issues discussed were violence and hate crimes.  There was a detailed update from the Department of Justice on the hate crime legislation on which the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is working.  The Minister intends to have the heads of Bill ready after the Easter recess.  That important legislation will benefit LGBTI+ and trans people.  It will deal with hate crime on the basis of race, gender, disability and a whole range of other areas.  This is the type of legislation that Ireland has lacked for far too long.<\/p><p> Another point was raised on surrogacy.  Today, I brought to Cabinet a review of the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Conor O'Mahony, on surrogacy laws in Ireland and what needs to be done.  The report has to be published and brought to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand we will do that later today.  The process will result in significant legislation.  We discussed the matter at Cabinet today.  Legislation is being worked on in the Department of Health.  The Taoiseach indicated we needed to prioritise this area.<\/p><p> Surrogacy is a great gift to parents who are not in a position to conceive.  It is also, however, a complicated area and one that needs regulation because it could potentially be exploited in a negative way.  It is important to have a strong, fair and robust regulatory framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#C00600","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I raised a point relating to access to services for young trans people.

We discussed this at the strategy meeting last week.  A new endocrinologist is in the process of being hired.  There are new supports on the mental health side of things as well.  I am being honest in saying this is progressing slower than I would like.  As I have said, the endocrinologist and clinical psychologist positions are now being filled.  That will be significant in creating a new nucleus of service provision in Ireland.  There is more to do in this sphere, undoubtedly.  Maybe it is a matter on which we can engage later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#D00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Deputy Murnane O'Connor is next.

My thanks to the Minister.  I welcome this budget.  It is important because everything we spoke about today relates to vital services.  We need to ensure funding is available.  This funding is always important but it has been especially important in the past year when so much has happened with Covid-19 and everything else.<\/p> <p>  I note one of the sections under childcare referred to a high-level goal of making childcare more affordable.  This issue has been raised with my office.  Many people want to know how we can achieve that goal.  I know the Minister is working on it but we need to do more work to address it.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to a study by Alcohol Action Ireland and University College Cork.  The report found that approximately 200,000 children are living in households impacted by alcohol use with a further 400,000 adult children coming from such homes.  The report recommended mandatory training in schools to recognise pupils who are experiencing trauma at home.  What are we doing with that training?  Is that provided for by the Minister in the Estimates?  What funding is available for that important task?<\/p> <p>  Schools are focusing on well-being and I welcome that.  Are we giving them the right resources?  Will the Minister address the issues of early learning care, school-aged childcare and Covid-19 related supports?  I am concerned about these issues.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from the other questions asked that many issues now cut across Departments.  We go to one Department for one thing and to another for something else.  We need to ensure when we are putting budgets that there is a working group that works with all the Departments.  If I go looking for information, I find I am often told I have contacted the wrong Department and I should go elsewhere.  That is very important, especially now with childcare.  The Minister might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  The third issue I raise relates to Tusla.  I welcome the &euro;66 million in additional funding the Minister said he has provided.  I am working with the Minister on a case involving funding near my home town.  We spoke about domestic violence and so on.  It is important that funding is provided now because we have such a large budget.<\/p><p>While we welcome that there is such a large budget, it is important in small areas like mine that services be kept going and there be no cuts.  We have seen an increase in domestic violence over the past year, or as was mentioned, perhaps it has been highlighted more.  It is important that we ensure that the resources go to those areas that need them.  Will the Minister consider this point?  It could be an issue.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned how disability services were moving into his Department.  That is welcome, as it will be important that the services under his aegis work together.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister will work well together.<\/p><p> The Minister discussed mother and baby homes, county homes and how he and his Department were working on adoptees being able to access their information.  The 22 recommendations must be acted on urgently.  It is important for survivors that, when they want to access their own information, we will have provided legislation to provide that access.  We must pass that legislation and the 22 recommendations should be worked on straight away.  From meeting the Minister, I understand how committed he is to doing all of this.  Will he revert to me on the matter?<\/p><p> There is a further issue that might affect us in the long term.  There has been a shortage of social workers, with fewer graduating.  That is a concern.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to give me some information on it.<\/p><p> We are going through the Covid pandemic, children have been at home and parents have been excellent at home schooling.  The past year has been difficult for everyone.  Proper funding must be provided to where it is needed now in order that we do not revert to the Minister in six months' time saying that certain areas are not accessing funding under his large budget.<\/p><p> I welcome the Minister's budget.  It is a very good one and will help.

Affordability is essential and something on which we want to focus.  The issue was raised on the doorstep at the last general election.  As the Deputy knows, we are concluding a major piece of research on the funding model.  Government policy, which will bind future Governments, has committed to a much greater and continued increase in investment in childcare.  We will spend &euro;638 million this year.  That is a significant amount.  We know that we must increase it, but we must also ensure that it is providing benefits, affordability and high-quality childcare that is accessible.  Our funding model group, having looked at best practice around the world, will guide us in the best way for the State to ensure that this significant investment is delivering on these three objectives.  The group is meant to report at the end of this year but I have asked that it bring forward some of its papers to this summer to inform me and my Department as we go into the Estimates process for 2022.  I would like to begin some of this work in budget 2022.<\/p> <p>  Regarding quality, we all know that ensuring childcare professionals are well paid is important.  That is why I was happy two weeks ago to write to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment asking it to create a joint labour committee, JLC, between employers and childcare professionals so as to start the process of setting a wage structure.  We all understand that childcare professionals, who have always done amazing work, but particularly so during the pandemic, are not being paid enough.  It is an almost entirely female workforce.  We need to address this issue and the JLC would be an important step towards doing so.<\/p> <p>  Overall policy for schools falls under the Department of Education.  However, my Department has engaged with Alcohol Action Ireland on its Operation Encompass project, which is one of the tools it uses to enhance awareness among children and young people of alcohol abuse and its links with domestic violence.  That work is being led by the Department of Education but we have been engaging with it.  It is an important issue.  In particular, the link between alcohol abuse and domestic violence is one that we all understand well.<\/p> <p>  Providing ongoing funding for all domestic violence services is critical.  In 2020 and 2021, Tusla allocated a specific fund to meet additional contingencies during Covid.  In some places, this saw an additional workforce.  Elsewhere, it involved IT upgrades as services moved online.  It was used almost everywhere for PPE.  In some places, it was used to pay for additional accommodation because existing accommodation units had to be reduced to allow for social distancing.  I am aware of the case that the Deputy cited.  The committee's Chairman, Deputy Funchion, and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, are also well aware of it.  My understanding is that work is ongoing at the highest levels within Tusla to resolve the case.  We hope to see an engagement.  Many Deputies have contacted me about this issue.  I will continue listening carefully to service providers in the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, sector, but my understanding is that there is a general degree of satisfaction with the 2021 budget allocation.<\/p> <p>  Like the Deputy, I am looking forward to the transfer of responsibility for disability services this year.  I work closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  While taking on responsibility for disability services can create synergies where children are concerned, we will be taking responsibility for all disability services from children onwards.  It is a big challenge and will double my Department's budget, but we are excited about getting involved in it.<\/p> <p>  Information and tracing are priorities for the Department.  My officials and I had a good meeting with the Attorney General and his team on the legislation last week.  We discussed what approaches could be taken.  It will be the end of this month or early April when I bring to the Cabinet proposals for the heads of a Bill.  Following the Cabinet's approval of those heads, we will bring them to the joint committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Undoubtedly, all of the Deputies and their colleagues from the Seanad will engage in that.  Subsequently, we will bring the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  It is a priority for me and I do not want to delay it in any way.  We are taking a different approach to it.  The drafting of the full heads of a Bill in just two or three months is ambitious but we will achieve it.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we will continue working on the other 21 recommendations.  I touched base with the team in my Department about a review of how we were getting on with each of the 22 recommendations.  As the Deputy knows, the public consultation on the restorative recognition scheme will remain ongoing until 31 March.  In that regard, we are trying to balance putting the consultation out to people and getting their views on what the scheme should deal with, while also moving quickly.  As every member of this committee has stated, many of the people involved are of an age where they cannot wait a long time for a restorative recognition scheme to be devised.<\/p> <p>  For many years, Tusla was losing social workers year on year.  In 2020, however, it had a net gain of 129 social workers.  That is positive.  The committee may have seen in recent days that Tusla announced a scheme whereby it would write to all of this year's graduating class offering to engage with them in advance of their graduation about potentially giving them interviews and jobs following registration.  This is another example of how Tusla has seen that there is considerable demand for social workers in all areas.  Tusla needs them and is taking active steps to try to secure as many of the graduating class as possible.  However, we need more social work positions in third level institutions across the country.  I have spoken to the relevant Minister, Deputy Harris, about this matter and will continue to engage with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#E00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before us today and talking us through the Estimates.  My questions cover the framework.  I will start with youth organisations.  I know there was a &euro;5 million increase allocated to those but young people have been particularly hard hit during Covid and there are many who would have disengaged with the education system and from their social circles and are in real need of supports.  Does the Minister think the &euro;5 million increase is sufficient?  Are there any opportunities?  Would he like to expand on that?<\/p> <p>  In respect of direct provision, the Minister spoke earlier about period poverty mechanisms and measures, which are really welcome.  When I think about period poverty, it is reflective of a poverty within the system - that women are not in a position to afford the basic fundamental essentials for themselves.  I know the Minister has proposed very significant changes for the direct provision system, which are welcome, but until they are in place, will there be additional funding or measures for people in direct provision outside the period poverty measures?  Obviously, we all recognise that direct provision is not a system we want and one that requires fundamental reform but it will takes years for that fundamental reform to happen.  Is the Minister looking at measures in the interim?  <\/p> <p>  The consultation in respect of the restorative recognition scheme about which the Minister spoke is up at the end of the month.  He said he needed to move quickly with it because in many instances, we are talking about older people.  Has a budget been set aside for any financial redress payments?  I did not see it in the Estimates.  Is there anything there for that or does the Minister anticipate that it would be next year before anything like that is sorted if that is what was needed?  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the childcare sector, there was no breakdown of Covid supports within the Estimates.  It would be interesting to see that breakdown.  Obviously, we have not gone back fully.  When the payments that go out to early education workers are suspended, is there any analysis by the Department of the impact of that suspension?  I know quite a number of early education workers were put on the pandemic unemployment payment.  It was a key issue for the Minister and Department to maintain that connection between the provider and the staff but, unfortunately, that did not seem to happen.  I think 4,500 childcare workers were receiving the pandemic unemployment payment.  We do not know at this point whether they will go back into the sector or whether that linkage has been broken to the point where it is irretrievable be it through the fact that they have got another job or will not go back into the sector.  Has there been any analysis by the Department of that?  Does the Minister expect that a significant number of staff will not go back into the sector?  Does he have any contingency plans in case that happens?  It would probably be more to do with geographical areas as it might hit some areas more than others.  Has the Minister looked into that?  <\/p> <p>  In respect of D4 relating to refugee and migrant integration, there was a plan to have 2,900 resettled refugees by 2023 but even more recently than that, last September there was an agreement by the Minister involving a number of refugees from the Moria camp, in particular unaccompanied minors.  My understanding is that none of those refugees has been resettled in Ireland.  When people are in dire straits and emergency situations, it is unfortunate that we are looking at a six, seven or eight-month delay in resettling those children and families.  Could the Minister provide us with an update on that?  Have any of those unaccompanied minors been resettled?  I think my last parliamentary question on it was last month so I am not sure what the latest development is.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#F00100","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I always want to grow the support we give to the youth sector.  I was delighted to give it an additional &euro;5 million this year.  I think it had been looking for &euro;4.7 million so we were able to go a bit beyond what the sector wanted.  I want to be able to continue to support it on its current spending.  We also gave additional capital supports in terms of IT grants and small Covid grants to many youth services across the country.  One grant was &euro;100, which is very small but in the context of these organisations, which are used to making a little go a long way, I know it was really appreciated when we did that last year.  The additional &euro;5 million will provide six new Your Place Your Space, UBU, services across the country.  Those six have already been identified.  There are an additional two new UBU services - these are the services targeted at areas of disadvantage - and they will be allocated later on this year.  There will be a tendering process.  There will be six services to meet existing gaps and two brand new services.  Having eight new services in a year is very significant and we are delighted to be able to do that.  I know the sector is under pressure at the moment and that many organisations have lost fundraising opportunities or subscriptions but the Government is providing significant additional support this year and I hope to be able to continue to do that.  I continue to engage very closely with the sector and provide support any way I can.<\/p> <p>  In respect of direct provision, under the new scheme outlined in my White Paper, people in phase two who are living independently will be able to avail of an international protection support payment, which will be linked to the social welfare payment.  That will be significant if they are living independently but not yet working.  Obviously, we want to support them in gaining access to work and there will be significant changes in that respect.  We made it clear that it will take a number of years to move to this new system.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I made a significant announcement two weeks ago regarding removing the financial costs of accessing higher and further education so the &euro;3,600 cost to enter a post-leaving certificate course will be removed.  This will be particularly significant because for many people, that might be more accessible or appealing than a full third-level course and might be more immediately beneficial in terms of increasing labour market attractiveness.  This is a very significant measure that removes a very significant barrier in the way of those in the international protection process upskilling themselves while they are waiting for a decision.  This is something I was delighted to be able to do in conjunction with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in addition to what I said about period poverty and access to driver licences and bank accounts.  There is a range of short, medium and long-term actions we must continue to work on in this area.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of restorative recognition, there is no allocation for the payments as yet.  This must be subject to a Government decision.  I hope to bring a memorandum to Cabinet later in the spring with regard to that following the result of the interdepartmental group process.  This process is going well.  It has this public engagement process about which I spoke a few moments ago.  The interdepartmental group involves civil servants hearing and getting written submissions from survivors - both individuals and groups - and gaining an understanding of what they see as important.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has agreed to provide some information to the interdepartmental group in terms of what did and did not work well with previous redress schemes and in particular, how we can ensure that human rights concepts are central to the redress scheme being designed.  I am really grateful to IHREC for its involvement.  It will draw up a paper and present to the interdepartmental group as well.<\/p><p>I will, obviously, then be engaging with religious congregations about their potential contributions to this scheme.  That is important.  The bespoke medical cad will also be a part of those considerations.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for early years childcare professions and those who were not kept on by their employers.  That did spike in January and it was disappointing to see that because we put significant supports in place through the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The enhanced rate available in January was meeting 80% of wage costs of the average childcare provider.  I do not see any need for childcare providers to have to go onto PUP.  That number has decreased and although I do not have the up-to-date figures, I can provide them to the Deputy, if necessary.<\/p><p> As the Deputy knows, childcare is reopening on a phased basis and the ECCE scheme is now fully open.  It will close for a couple of weeks over Easter and early learning and school-aged childcare will kick back in from 29 April.  It will probably be after Easter when the entire sector is reopened and that will probably be our best chance to reassess needs and longer-term losses.<\/p><p> I know there was an article in some newspapers approximately two weeks ago that discussed the risks of extensive closures of services.  From my engagement with parents and the advisory council that talks to its providers, my sense is that parents want their childcare services back and will continue to use them.  The Deputy alluded to the areas in which they are located and that, in the medium to long term, there may be some changes in that area.  Even if we see a much greater return to remote or flexible working, which we probably will, I believe that the vast majority of parents who currently avail of childcare, be it ECCE, wider services or school-aged childcare, will continue to want to do so.  We will continue to support that sector in what might be an evolving situation.  We will continue to offer supports to the sector.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned unaccompanied minors.  Unfortunately, level 5 has meant that there have been major restrictions on our ability to engage in terms of unaccompanied minors or the wider Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP.  We brought over a group of 165 Syrian refugees from camps around Beirut in Lebanon in November.  I met them at a hotel in Santry after they had done their quarantine.  It was an amazing experience to meet all those people, particularly the children, all of whom were translating for their parents and who were excited about starting life in Ireland.  That was the most recent consignment of refugees who arrived under the IRPP.<\/p><p> Next week, we hope to send a group from Tusla and the Garda to Greece to begin the process of bringing 14 unaccompanied minors to Ireland.  As the Deputy knows, when the fire in Moria took place, we only had the capacity to bring over an additional four refugees because of budgetary issues.  We secured additional funding so that we now have capacity to bring over 14 refugees, who have been identified.  There was a significant issue on the EU side.  The EU changed the manner in which it was deciding who could qualify as an unaccompanied minor to be taken by member states.  That caused a delay in October and November and, when the higher levels of lockdown took place, journey were not taking place.  Tusla officials will be going over to Greece in the next week to, we hope, bring over 14 identified unaccompanied minors.  We have put in place a range of supports in terms of private residences.  We are also looking at developing a new fostering scheme specifically for families fostering unaccompanied minors.  These children are usually a good bit older than other children entering foster care.  We will be looking to bring over more children.  We have an existing commitment to take 28 children and we need to meet that.  We are hoping to bring over 14 unaccompanied minors in the near future but we now have the funding to meet that full commitment of 28.<\/p><p> It was great to get &euro;5 million in this area but it does not go a long way.  We are putting in place an extensive range of supports for these young people, as is appropriate and correct.  It is money well spent but it is costly and that is why &euro;5 million gives us provision for a number of young people in the 20s or 30s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2021032300002#F00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister and his officials for attending and dealing comprehensively with the questions from the committee.

I am accompanied by the Minister of State, who has responsibility for special education, and by officials from my Department.  I am conscious that I have very limited time in which to deliver my opening statement so I will just give a brief overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2021.<\/p> <p>  These Revised Estimates set out the approved allocations for the Department, including funding for all of the services normally provided or supported by it.  They also include substantial additional funding to meet costs associated with the reopening of schools and sustaining teaching and learning as part of the Covid-19 response covering the period to the end of the current school year.  The Revised Estimates also reflect the completion of the transfer of functions from the Department of Education to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the transfer into my Department of funding from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of certain education functions being performed by Tusla.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 26 provides for a net allocation of &euro;8.644 billion, representing a gross allocation of &euro;8.961 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of some &euro;300 million.  This represents an increase in gross expenditure of some &euro;250 million, or 3%, over the 2020 allocation.  I made the point previously to the committee that a significant proportion of the funding allocated to Vote 26 will be expended on gross pay and pensions, with sums amounting to over &euro;7 billion included in the Vote for these purposes.  This represents some 80% of the expenditure allocation.  Some 90,600 public servants and 43,200 public service pensioners are paid out of these funds.  Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, school transport, capitation grants to schools and grants to other organisations and agencies.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2021 included a number of measures relevant to the education system.  It included additional funding to enable the total number of non-Covid-related teaching posts to rise by 1,065 by the end of this year.  Of these posts, a net 268 will derive from forecast demographics.  Four hundred and three additional teachers will be working with children with special needs and there will be 394 new teaching posts created at primary level to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes.  This includes a new measure to assist schools to retain teachers while dealing with Covid-19 requirements.<\/p> <p>  The budget also included initiatives in the area of social inclusion, with additional funding being provided to reduce by one point the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, senior schools urban band-1 staffing schedule, and an additional &euro;2 million for Gaeltacht placement grants and &euro;1 million for the continued implementation of the Gaeltacht education policy.  An additional &euro;3.5 million has been provided to continue investment in the Creative Ireland and Music Generation programmes.<\/p> <p>   Special education continues to be a priority.  Almost 1,000 additional special needs assistant, SNA, posts will be allocated, bringing the total number of SNAs in our schools to over 18,000 in 2021.  This will support the rolling out of the new school inclusion model, including a new allocation methodology for mainstream schools in the 2021 school year, which will ensure students with additional needs get the right supports at the right time, as well as supporting the new special needs class places.<\/p> <p>  An additional 145 special education teacher posts will be provided for while 235 new teachers will be recruited to work in special classes in our schools, with another 23 teachers hired for special schools.  This investment in additional teaching posts will ensure that more than 1,200 new places in special classes will be provided.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 investment includes a capital allocation for new and more energy-efficient school buildings, with a &euro;740 million budget for 2021 under Project Ireland 2040.  This funding will sustain the rolling out of projects, including some 140 projects under the large-scale and additional accommodation schemes whose construction activity is due to commence before July 2021.  These projects will add significant additional capacity to the school system to manage in the Covid environment and to cater for increased demographics.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with a few words on Covid.  The Government's roadmap for the full reopening of schools, approved in July 2020, included a significant package of funding to sustain school reopening, for the replacement of teachers and non-teaching staff unable to attend for work due to Covid-19, additional release days for principals and deputy principals, and enhanced cleaning regimes, personal protective equipment, PPE, and well-being supports.  The total amount allocated for the 2020-2021 school year is &euro;639 million.  Of that, &euro;331 million related to 2020 and comprised a capital allocation of &euro;180 million and &euro;151 million in current funding.  The balance of that allocation, amounting to some &euro;308 million, is included in these Estimates.  This funding is, as before, available to meet substitution and supervision, cleaning, sanitiser, PPE and school transport costs.  No Covid-related capital allocation has been included in these Estimates.  There was very significant Covid-related capital expenditure in 2020, much of it brought forward.  As with other Covid-19 related spending, funding for the 2021-2022 school year will be reviewed in line with the latest public health advice available and previous Covid-19 costs.  In this regard, a central contingency reserve was allocated in the 2021 budget by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which includes funds specifically earmarked for schools for the remainder of 2021, that is, for the period from August to December.<\/p> <p>  The committee will appreciate that the position on Covid remains fluid.  The education sector is in the process of reopening and I expect that all schools will be open again on 5 April.  The leaving certificate examinations will take place in June and a system of accredited grades will be available.  A very significant allocation of funding has been made in these Estimates to sustain reopening and to ensure the welfare of staff and students.  I trust that this brief overview has been of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail.  I commend the Revised Estimate for 2021 to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#A00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It has included independent scrutiny by the Parliamentary Budget Office, including PBO papers, the public service performance report and spending review papers.  Considerable effort has been made to make the information more user-friendly and more transparent, not just for the benefit of the committees but for the benefit of all concerned.<\/p> <p>  Regarding reductions this year, at the end of 2020, moneys that were due to be expended in 2021 were made available to schools to spend at the end of 2020.  This included additional minor works grants and the digital access grants.  Some &euro;50 million that was due to be spent later in 2021 was made available at the end of 2020.  That accounts for any discrepancy.  There is no reduction; it is just that the money was given towards the end of 2020 to allow schools make the necessary provision for any building works that needed to be carried out or make improvements to digital access.  For example, many schools chose to purchase equipment and provide it to children who were in need of it.  The work on the purchase of platforms had previously been done.  The decision was taken to bring money from 2021 into 2020 to afford schools the opportunity to better manage the needs of the schools, particularly in the atmosphere that pertained during the Covid pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#C00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on the previous comments on school transport.

I have two specific questions.  One relates to the funding that has been put aside or prioritised to ensure children can catch up and not just that they can return to school.  In addition to making adjustments to schools and providing more personal protective equipment, PPE, or hand sanitiser, they need to be able to ensure children can regain what they lost.  What funding is available in that regard?  I have previously spoken to the Minister about the &pound;1 billion catch-up fund for children in the UK.  There do not appear to be specific measures in place for children, especially those from a disadvantaged background, to analyse and then to ensure they can repair some of the damage caused by not being in school, notwithstanding that they were being taught or that efforts were made to teach them as best we could.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to demographic pressures.  In my constituency many parents cannot find a place for their child at second level.  This may be more of a policy measure than a financial one.  What kind of funding mechanisms does the Department have to ensure areas of the country undergoing demographic pressures can have increased access to second level schools?<\/p> <p>  I have a further question on face coverings for oral exams, but that may be a discussion for a different time.  Perhaps the Minister could communicate with me separately on that.  I ask her to respond on the catch-up fund for children and on investments to ensure the pressures as a result of demographic changes can be eased to allow for greater access to second level places.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#C00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>On the catch-up fund and funding being made available to schools, the Deputy rightly made reference to disadvantaged children.  Some &euro;150 million a year is allocated to our DEIS schools.  As I have said, in excess of &euro;639 million has been expended on schools' reopening.  We are working on an extended or enhanced summer provision programme which will help in compensating for a loss of in-person teaching and learning experiences.  The Deputy will be aware the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has made available a &euro;2.1 billion contingency fund for Covid-19.  The Department of Education is a named Department in that respect.  Obviously, we will be looking to access funding from there.<\/p> <p>  We have recently announced measures to extend the school completion programme.  We are working on the provision of the extended summer programme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the demographic issues in his own area in north Dublin and he has raised this with me previously.  I will give it some context.  There are 314 school planning areas which use the geographical information system containing data compiled from a variety of sources.  Conscious that major new residential developments, including some in the Deputy's own area, can add to pressure within an area, the Department now also liaises with local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  I am cognisant that specific issues in an area may arise for a variety of reasons, including duplication of applications and parents being particular about the school they want to choose.<\/p><p>There may be an external draw where pupils are coming from outside a local area.  Specifically, however, the Department is aware of the issues in the Deputy's own area, which he has raised with me.  We are conscious that we are currently working with the patrons and the schools to address any issues in that specific area and that we have planning exemptions which can be used to provide for any additional temporary accommodation on school sites.  We now also have a modular accommodation framework in place to shorten the procurement timeline.  The Department is satisfied, specifically with regard to that particular area, that requirements for September 2021 and beyond can be met.  It is an area of particular concern to us, in that we know areas are growing.

Our report recommends that the provision of hot meals to vulnerable students should be expanded to cover periods of school closures and holidays, and that a hot meals programme should be rolled out nationally to all schools on a phased basis.  For those children in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion the problems will go much further, extending even to difficulties accessing basic nutrition during the school week.  It is an area on which we need to work hard to protect and improve the situation.  I acknowledge that the Government has made some progress in terms of rolling out and expanding the school meals programme that is already in place but we must avoid losing focus in this important area.  What other actions are planned to make sure we improve this area and improve the outcomes for children who are disadvantaged with regard to the school meals?<\/p> <p>  My next question refers to our report's finding that primary schools receive significantly less funding than secondary schools.  There is also a specific issue regarding the number of school management posts.  We were of the view as a committee that there is now a need for a review of the short-term funding needs of schools.  A more fundamental review of funding, however, also needs to be carried out in order that the requisite school management is in place to provide quality leadership for the whole school community.  What is the Minister's view on that issue?  How does she expect to resolve this matter?  Does she feel a review is necessary with regard to this ongoing problem in terms of the shortfall in funding for primary schools, but also in terms of school management posts, particularly in post-primary schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#D00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  She referenced the hot meal programme.  I absolutely agree with her that it is a hugely important programme within our schools.  It is funded through the Department of Social Protection and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has responsibility for that programme.  This obviously is done in co-operation with my Department but the funding actually comes from elsewhere.  I recognise absolutely its importance on the ground, particularly, as the Deputy referenced, for children who might have particular disadvantages.  It has and continues to run successfully.  A further extension of the budget was provided this year from the Department of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in order that the hot meal programme could be extended.  I acknowledge how important that is within the schools.  Obviously, we will continue to seek the largest possible roll-out of that initiative.  It is of immense benefit.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the funding for primary schools, again, I will point out the enormous amounts of money in terms of grants and supports for schools this year.  Not least, for example, in the primary school sector, where there has been a considerable roll-out of minor works grants.  I wish to acknowledge the tremendous manner in which all schools, and as the Deputy referenced in this instance, primary schools, utilised that funding to reimagine, add additionality to and make spaces available within schools and do the necessary work.  I accept that the money was timely for many primary schools, even outside of a Covid-19 atmosphere.  I am committed to schemes of that nature, including the emergency work, summer work and minor work schemes continuing into the future to support works that are needed on the ground.<\/p> <p>  On comparability with primary and secondary level, which was raised previously by Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, we are really speaking about two very different experiences in terms of sizes of buildings, types of rooms and so forth.  There is not, therefore, a specific comparability.  I want to make it clear, however, that there has been a significant increase in funding this year for the primary school sector going forward.  There has been significant additionality even in terms of initiatives that have been brought in, whether it is the substitution panels being made available to schools or the additional days for teaching principals being made available this year.  All of these are to the necessary benefit of schools and the work of principals and staff on the ground.  It is my intention to ensure that we support those initiatives to the very best of our capacity going forward, within budgetary constraints, to ensure services that need to be provided, both from a structural and a service point of view in primary schools, will continue to be well-supported financially .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#D00400","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I am accompanied today by the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, who has responsibility for skills and further education and by officials from the Department.  I am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement so I will be very brief and give an overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2021.  I can pick up on issues in the exchanges with members.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for the Department&rsquo;s 2021 Estimate was drawn up in late 2020 as part of the 2021 Estimates process, which allocated an additional &euro;236 million.  The increased allocation for the Department allowed me to fund a number of major priorities, including provision for increased undergraduate places to support leaving certificate students, meeting demographic increases and support skills development, increasing supports for postgraduate students in the SUSI scheme and increasing the allocation to meet demand for SUSI grants, increasing funding for access programmes, providing additional funding to support the research system, and investing in skills provision, particularly as we try to rebuild and repair after the Covid pandemic.  These measures were in addition to the Covid supports provided to the further and higher education sector and to students during 2020.  In total, these supports amounted to &euro;216 million, with an additional &euro;100 million for skills provision from the National Training Fund.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s capital ceiling was also increased, and funding was also provided to meet the costs associated with the public sector pay deal.  Indeed, 47% of the Department&rsquo;s gross Vote is allocated to pay and pensions, reflecting the crucial work our public servants carry out in the further and higher education system and in the science and innovation sector.  This Department provides the funding for more than 25,000 public servants and more than 11,000 public servant pensioners.<\/p> <p>  Today marks the first time the Department&rsquo;s Vote inclusive of research, innovation and science funding will be discussed at the committee.  In many ways, the timing could not be better, as on 8 March we launched the new Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy.  This outlines our goals to develop talent and skills, support learning for all, and promote Irish research, knowledge and innovation on the world stage.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 45 before the committee provides for a net allocation of &euro;2.7 billion, representing a gross allocation of &euro;2.8 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of &euro;100 million.  When taken with the National Training Fund expenditure available, the overall gross expenditure allocation for my Department in 2021 increases to &euro;3.5 billion.<\/p> <p>  The Vote 45 allocation comprises a number of key elements.  These are an allocation of more than &euro;2.5 billion to meet the various requirements of the Department in the areas of further and higher education, including some increase during the 2021 Estimates process reflecting the public sector pay deal, an increase to the capital ceiling and other assorted expenditure, the transfer of &euro;226 million in funding from Vote 32 relating to research, innovation and science along with additional research funding secured as part of the budget for 2021, and an allocation of &euro;20 million in budget 2021 to fund Covid-19 student grants through Student Universal Support Ireland in the face of the ongoing pandemic.<\/p> <p>  We are all well aware of the profound impact that Covid-19 has had globally over the past year.  I place on record my gratitude to all involved in ensuring the continued health and safety of our students, lecturers and researchers, and to those working on a plan to safely reopen our institutions and establishments as much as possible in the near future.  I want to students to have more on-site attendance in the next academic year.  I pay tribute to students.  Sometimes there can be an unfair narrative about students.  They have overwhelmingly worked to follow the public health advice and play their part in the national effort against Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  I trust this overview is of some assistance to the committee and I look forward to discussing these issues in more detail.  I commend the Revised Estimate to the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#G00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and join him in commending students on the huge work they have done this year and on everything they have done to maintain safety, working with other students to support them.  The figures provided indicate that the general grant to the institutes of technology and universities has been cut by 9%.  Is that correct?  My next question is on CAO places and the pressure on the leaving certificate.  Is the Minister satisfied the budget will be able to do enough to bring additional places into third level to ease the pressure on the CAO system?  How many additional places will be added for undergraduate students coming through the CAO system in 2021?  How many of these will be over and above the number projected to meet demographic demands?  Specifically with regard to graduate entry medical students, excluding places for international students and places already allocated to those who sat the leaving certificate last November, how many medical places will be available to the class of 2021?

I will try to take the questions in sequence.  The year-on-year movement for higher education is skewed due to the temporary Covid funding in 2020.<\/p><p>Of the &euro;216 million allocated to my Department for Covid in 2020, &euro;202 million was allocated to higher education.  Removing Covid from the 2020 and the 2021 figures shows that the higher education programme B has actually increased year on year by &euro;161 million.  This is driven by measures in budget 2021.  University and institute of technology grants, which come under subhead B4 and which I believe the Deputy is referring to, had &euro;156 million in temporary Covid support in 2020.  This skews the figure when comparing year on year.  When one excludes that temporary funding, the real movement year on year under subhead B4 is an increase of 6%, or &euro;58 million.  This is driven by additional funding in budget 2021 for pay deals, research and additional calculated grade places.  As the committee will be aware, the Government holds Covid money for this year centrally.  My Department is expecting to receive an allocation of this money in the coming weeks as we work through the impact of Covid.  Year on year and like for like, the level of funding under the general current grants in subhead B4 is up 6%.  That is the reason the 9% is skewed.  I hope I got all the Deputy's questions.  If I did not, she should please come back to me.<\/p><p> On places, as of now and standing still based on the budget allocation, we have funding to provide 4,130 additional higher education places this September compared with last year.  Of these, 2,700 are based on demographic projections and the remainder are based on the human capital initiative.  Today we have the funding in place for just over 4,000 additional places.  The challenge that has been put to me is can we do more above and beyond that.  I believe we can.  I have set up a working group in the Department which is working with the CAO, the universities and the institutes.  It will report back to me just after Easter, at which time I intend to go to Cabinet to say what more we will be able to do, subject to the Government making funding available.<\/p><p> There are some constraints, mainly in the context of placements.  It is important, in many areas, that for any extra place we create, we must also have a matching placement.  We will be linking with the Department of Health for nursing and medical placements and with the Department of Education in the context of teaching placements.  On a specific answer regarding the medical places and on how many additional places there will be above and beyond the 4,000, we will have clarity next month.  I will be happy to come back to the committee with a detailed note or to engage with it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#G00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

There is an area that we have not seen the improvement we would wish to see, namely, that relating to mature students.  There is a major opportunity arising from Covid.  We must try to find the opportunities in the context of delivering education in a more flexible way and ensuring that mature students can access education in an easier way.  We will look to set targets and new types of targets around access.  I am very concerned that when we measure disability we only measure some disabilities.  I do not believe there is a broad enough metric in that regard.  Through public consultation there will be an opportunity for everyone to make their views known, probably over the summer months.  I would also be very happy to make officials available to this committee in getting the views of the committee on how we can have the most robust national access plan possible.

It is slow progress and I would like to see more done.  I am glad that the information was presented.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to my questions.  Is there a specific funding provision for technological university, TU, projects?  Will the Minister consider enacting legislation to allow the technological universities to borrow in the same way that the regular universities do so there is a funding stream apart from a the Central Fund and the Exchequer?<\/p> <p>  Referring to appendix B on apprenticeships, our output target in 2020 was 20,000.  Our output target in 2021 is only 21,000.  This is a very modest increase.  This question is to the Minister of State.  Are we really hoping to ramp up our ambition here?  I am thinking specifically of our retrofit targets.<\/p> <p>  Subheads A1 and B1 both have a 17% or 18% increase in administration costs.  I am always wary when I see a jump in administration costs.

This is given out over a number of years.  The Deputy will be familiar with that.  The Government has, to date, invested heavily in the TU agenda with more than &euro;65 million invested so far through landscape and transformation funding.  The transformation fund will expend &euro;90 million up to 2023, with &euro;34.3 million having been allocated in the first tranche last October.  In total, more than &euro;120 million will have been invested in TU development and progression.<\/p> <p>  I assure the committee there is no lack of commitment to ensuring that all areas can benefit from the region-centric and multi-campus TU.

More students got a college place this year than ever before.  This year, more students will get a college place again.

Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, speakers will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I am sure there will be no need to make any such direction and, if there is, that it will be complied with immediately.  For any of our witnesses who are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, which I understand is all of them, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as would a witness who is physically present.

The last time a representative of D&oacute;chas appeared before the committee, in October 2020, there was a discussion on the implementation of the sustainable development goals, both in Ireland and overseas.  SDG 5, achieving gender equality, means we commit to ending all forms of discrimination, violence and harmful practices against women and girls everywhere.  It means recognising the value of unpaid care and domestic work.  It means ensuring women's full and effective participation, and equal opportunities for leadership, at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.  It means ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health, reproductive rights and economic rights and resources.  Above all, SDG 5 means that governments must adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at all levels.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased to be appearing before the committee this month as it coincides with a number of global events on gender equality.  The 65th sessions of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the UN's largest annual gathering on gender equality and women's empowerment, is taking place currently.<\/p><p>The Generation Equality Forum, organised by UN women and co-hosted by France and Mexico, will begin at the end of March having been delayed by a year because of Covid-19.  It is timely also that we discuss this issue today as the Citizens' Assembly in Ireland resumes its work exploring recommendations to advance gender equality.  Our efforts at home are inextricably linked with efforts at the EU, regionally and internationally to ensure women's rights.<\/p><p> It is more than 25 years since the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action were agreed at the Fourth World Conference on Women when 189 states, including Ireland, declared their determination to advance the goals of equality, development and peace for all women everywhere in the interest of all humanity.  Since then, we know that progress on gender equality has seen some positive steps forward but progress has been all too slow.  Not a single country today can claim to have achieved gender equality, nor can any country claim to be one where women feel completely safe on our streets, as the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard while walking home in London demonstrates.  This must change.<\/p><p> Today, however, we wish to focus on the specific impacts Covid-19 has had on women and girls across the world and we ask this committee to become a champion for them.  The UN Secretary General, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, recently said that gender equality was the world's biggest human rights scourge and the Covid-19 crisis has a woman&rsquo;s face.  He said, &ldquo;Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage.&rdquo;<\/p><p> Goal is very conscious of the impact of Covid-19 on achieving gender equality and our teams are seeing first-hand how violence against women and girls in all forms has escalated.  In response, we are integrating gender-based violence and child protection messaging into our Covid-19 awareness campaigns.  In Zimbabwe, for example, Goal is including gender-based violence, GBV, protection messaging into its Covid-19 campaign, which to date has reached 2.8 million people.  We know also that women's jobs are two times more vulnerable than men's and, indeed, we are currently seeing large volumes of women leaving the workforce as a result of the pandemic.<\/p><p> To speak to these issues in more detail, I am delighted to be accompanied today by colleagues from Plan International in Jordan, Christian Aid Ireland's partner, ABColombia, and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPS, who will speak of the impact of the pandemic on girls' education, displacement, conflict and reproductive health.  What each theme has in common is that there must be a renewed urgency to finding gender transformative policy responses that not only build back better, but in a more equal way.  We need to ensure that Ireland, in every facet of its foreign policy, positions gender equality at the centre of its approach towards a healthy and peaceful world.  In effect, Ireland must develop on goal 5 of the sustainable development goals by 2030.<\/p><p> Today we have four specific asks of the committee.  Our first ask is that the committee assists us in ensuring there is a more robust tracking of Ireland's progress in furthering the SDG agenda in its partner countries and internationally, including tracking data on marginalised groups which include women and girls and people living with disabilities.<\/p><p> We ask the committee also to support the EU's Gender Action Plan and call on the Irish Government to swiftly operationalise it, including the commitment to allocate 85% of overseas development aid, ODA, to programmes which have gender equality as their principle objective, and to support the implementation of a gender responsive recovery plan from Covid-19.<\/p><p> Third, we ask that the committee support Ireland's international commitment in its A Better World policy to addressing girls' education as a priority.  We need a clear roadmap that outlines how Irish Aid intends to commit to and spend at least &euro;250 million over five years on global education.<\/p><p> Finally, we ask the committee to work with the Irish Government to ensure it uses its voice on the UN Security Council to encourage all countries to fully implement the commitments in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, better known as CEDAW.<\/p><p> Ireland has been a champion for women, peace and security and we want to see that champion work on gender equality more broadly.  I thank the committee for its support for these asks.  I will now hand over to Ms Muna Abbas, head of mission and country director with Plan International in Jordan, who will speak to the committee about the situation in Jordan with respect to girls' education, Covid-19 and displacement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Van Lieshout.  I thank the Chairman and respected committee members.  It is my pleasure to be with the committee this morning.<\/p> <p>  While the Syrian crisis marks its tenth year this month, 40% of children under the age of 18 are registered as refugees.  Jordan and Lebanon, as neighbouring countries, host the highest percentage of refugees globally when compared to the local population.  Both Jordan and Lebanon are countries with limited resources where governments have already been struggling to respond to the needs of their own citizens, a situation that puts these countries at high risk of instability.<\/p> <p>  In Jordan, for example, 90,000 Syrian refugee children were reported to be out of school in 2019.  This number is expected to be dramatically increased during the pandemic as the Government has closed schools and other learning spaces in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus.<\/p> <p>  In such a complex context, girls are the most affected as they can be subjected to gender-based violence, including early marriage.  When we say, \"early marriage\", we mean marriage under the age of 18.  Eventually, they are deprived of their right to education while also not having access to vital services for protection, nutrition, health and well-being.  Before the conflict, 13% of Syrian women aged between 20 to 35 were married before the age of 18.  Now, among Syrian refugees living in Jordan, rates have risen to as high as 29%. <\/p> <p>  In assessments conducted by Plan International in Jordan jointly with the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown on girls, results show that adolescent girls have high household burdens and fewer positive outlets.  Girls are busier doing household chores as well as taking care of younger children and helping them with their studies.  All this means less time for adolescent girls to focus on their own education.<\/p> <p>  The gender digital divide whereby girls have reduced access to information and communication technology translates into reduced learning opportunities during school closures.  For example, the average cost for Internet services per household in Jordan is approximately $50 per month, which most families cannot afford, especially during the pandemic and lockdown and particularly among Syrian refugee families.  Girls also reported that they have less access to tech devices such as mobile telephones, tablets and computers compared with boys in the same family.<\/p> <p>  With the support of Irish Aid and other donors, over the past four years we were able to support thousands of Syrians and vulnerable Jordanian children, mainly girls, to access educational opportunities.  During the pandemic last year, hundreds of girls were supported to attend online classes by providing them with electronic devices and Internet connectivity.<\/p> <p>  The needs are huge and they are still here.  An entire generation is at risk.  We know we can help and how we can do so.  We believe that together we can make a difference to those children's lives.  I thank the committee.  I will hand over to Ms Winstanly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Muna Abbas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Agenda 2030 for the UN sustainable development goals recognises that development cannot be achieved without addressing violent conflict and building peace.  In 2016, more countries were experiencing violent conflict than at any other time in the previous 30 years.  Much of this violence is due to reoccurring and protracted conflicts.  ABColombia is a partner of Christian Aid Ireland.<\/p><p>For the next few minutes I will focus on Colombia.<\/p><p> Ireland has a long history of supporting peace in Colombia and this year it is particularly crucial.  November will mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the peace accord, which is currently in a very fragile state.  In 2020, there was a quadrupling of the number of victims of massacres and combat increased by 65% compared with the last year before the signing of the peace accord.  In January this year, over 11,000 people were forced to displace due to armed conflict as neo-paramilitary and other armed groups expanded their control over communities, territory and illicit economies.  Targeted killings have also resulted in over 400 human rights defenders and 261 former FARC combatants being killed since 2016.<\/p><p> The coronavirus pandemic has played into this context, particularly affecting women and aggravating inequality and poverty.  Women's participation in the labour market has fallen to the level of ten years ago as the pandemic hit the informal work in which women were engaged particularly hard.  Confinement as a measure against coronavirus has meant those threatening women human rights defenders have been easily able to locate them.  Many women defenders have been shot in or near their homes.  Domestic violence has increased, as have femicides.<\/p><p> The conflict has left many women as heads of household, widening the inequality gap, and sexual and gender violence has been perpetrated as a weapon of war.  One of the unique features of the Colombian peace accord is that it wove into all the agreements specific gender provisions.  These gender provisions have the potential for structural change by reducing gender inequalities and furthering the rights of rural women, which is why when considering gender, peace and development in Colombia, the peace accord in an important roadmap not only for peace building but also for good governance policies.<\/p><p> Comprehensive implementation of these programmes would contribute to gender empowerment and equality.  However, for the peace accord to be implemented, it is essential to address the escalating violence by near-paramilitary and other criminal groups.  These groups will only effectively be dismantled if the intellectual authors are identified and prosecuted and their sources of finance and political protection are cut off.  Ireland, with its position on the UN Security Council, should call for that body to establish an independent group or panel of experts on organised crime to examine the position in Colombia.  A technical report from an independent group of experts would strengthen the work of the UN mission of verification to Colombia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, both of which have security guarantees within their mandates.  Such a report would also assist Colombia in the design and implementation of a public policy to facilitate the identification and prosecution of the intellectual authors and a dismantling of these groups.<\/p><p> Colombia is a country which, compared with many other complex cases of conflict around the world, has a real possibility of achieving peace.  It needs a country like Ireland to throw its weight and experience behind achieving the appointment of UN Security Council group of experts on organised crime that can offer the technical expertise that Colombia needs now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Winstanley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Good morning and I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I will specifically address the question of sexual and reproductive health rights as an aspect of gender equality.  The Irish Family Planning Association is the secretariat to the all-party Oireachtas interest group on sexual and reproductive health and the Irish collaborating partner of the UN Population Fund, UNFPA.  It is also a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation.<\/p> <p>  I will start with A Better World, Ireland's policy for international development, which is grounded, as members know, in human rights and the sustainable development goals.  It recognises sexual and reproductive health rights as central to gender equality and universal health coverage.  A Better World commits Ireland to advancing and protecting the programme of action of the International Conference on Population and Development, including action on sexual and reproductive health.  According to A Better World, access to health services, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, is fundamental to realising sexual and reproductive health rights and for transforming women's health outcomes.  The pandemic has had a devastating impact on women's and girls' access to basic health services, including family planning.  I will concentrate on three aspects, which are sexual and reproductive health and rights, female genital mutilation and child marriage and access to contraception.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, in a policy brief on the impact of the pandemic on women, the UN Secretary General outlined the unique health needs of women and girls and also the social norms and gender stereotypes that act as barriers to services.  My colleagues have mentioned some of these.  According to the report, the diversion of attention and critical resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health services can result in exacerbated maternal mortality and morbidity, increased rates of adolescent pregnancies, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.<\/p> <p>  Last November, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brophy, launched the 2020 State of World Population report, which is published each year by UNFPA, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency.  The report estimated the impact of the pandemic on girls and according to the report, programmes designed to promote gender equality by ending practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation are facing serious delays in implementation.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Abbas, has already raised the question of child marriage.  According to the UNFPA, at a conservative estimate, a one-year average delay in interventions to end child marriage could lead to over 7 million more child marriages over the next decade that could otherwise have been averted.  In addition, the State of World Population report projected that financial insecurities caused by the pandemic could result in 5.6 million additional child marriages taking place between 2020 and 2030.  The total effect of Covid-19 could therefore potentially result in 13 million additional child marriages that would not otherwise have happened.<\/p> <p>  On the question of female genital mutilation, the UNFPA predicts an estimated two-year delay in prevention programmes would lead to 2 million cases of female genital mutilation over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.  In that respect progress towards the elimination of female genital mutilation, which is target 5.5 of the sustainable development goals, could be reduced by a third.<\/p> <p>  The UNFPA also conducted analysis in 115 low and middle income countries in January this year.  The research suggests that while many countries were able to maintain or restore access to essential services, an estimated 12 million women may have been unable to access family planning services during the pandemic, with disruption of supplies and services lasting an average of 3.6 months.  As a result of these disruptions, as many as 1.4 million unintended pregnancies may have occurred before women were able to resume use of these services.<\/p> <p>  The forthcoming session of the Commission on Population and Development, which will be in April 2021, will focus on the impact of Covid-19 on sexual and reproductive health in the context of population, food security, nutrition and sustainable development.  These are the four key principles of Irish Aid's programme.  In advance of the commission, the UN Secretary General has called for coverage of sexual and reproductive healthcare to be prioritised as integral to sustainable development.  He has highlighted the need for family planning, emergency contraception, the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, post-abortion care and, where legal, safe abortion services to the full extent of the law.<\/p> <p>   Female genital mutilation, child marriage and unintended pregnancy have a devastating impact on girls, affecting physical and mental health, their ability to stay in education, the capacity to reach full potential as women, citizens, workers and leaders.  Investment in sexual and reproductive health will have transformative effects on gender equality and women's empowerment.  This includes programmes that support the right of women and couples to choose the number and spacing of any children they opt to have.  We can reduce unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion through the provision of comprehensive sexuality education, contraception and safe and legal abortion care.  However, UNFPA, in its 2020 pandemic response plan, identified a funding gap of approximately US$276 million that would be required to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of those in humanitarian, fragile and development contexts.<\/p><p>Ireland is a consistent supporter of the UNFPA, which oversees implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, agenda.  Ireland contributes core funding of approximately &euro;3.5 million a year.  Ireland supports reproductive health initiatives through its bilateral programme and is highly regarded by its partners for a strategic approach that sees gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights as indispensable to sustainable development.  This support must be maintained, expanded and increased if efforts to build forward better are to meaningfully address gender equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Taylor.

They are very much appreciated.  They contained some useful information but also some stark and worrying statistics and information.  I appreciate the opportunity to engage with the witnesses and to ask questions.  I agree totally with the comment that gender inequality is one of the world's greatest human rights scourges.  That is a very important point to make at this stage and a very important starting point for us all.  It is important to address the human rights scourge that is gender inequality.  We see human rights as the bedrock of everything we do and everything we should do, but we also see how human rights defenders across the world, particularly women human rights defenders, are targeted and imprisoned.  I have addressed this issue on many occasions.  In countries such as Saudi Arabia, female human rights defenders are imprisoned for doing such basic things as applying for a job within the UN.  These are big issues that we need to get on top of if we are serious about addressing human rights abuses.<\/p> <p>  Covid has shown up many difficulties and highlighted many areas in which gender inequality is rife.  It is has also highlighted other challenges with regard to domestic violence.  This has, of course, been with us for far too long but it has become more prevalent over the past year or so.  I have engaged with a number of organisations that deal with domestic violence in Ireland.  Only last week, I met a group in my constituency of Wicklow: Bray Women's Refuge.  Those I met with unfortunately painted a very stark picture with regard to how bad the problem has become over the past year.  We have such supports in our country, although unfortunately not at the level needed, but I can only imagine how women must feel in less well off, developing countries where there are not such supports.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has done a great deal to address the issues of inequality and gender inequality but we are not doing enough with regard to the SDGs, particularly the fifth goal, which concerns gender inequality.  I believe we are ranked tenth in the statistics for 2020, which shows that we have a long way to go if Ireland is to be in a position to say we are doing everything we can.  In its report, Social Justice Ireland states that Ireland needs to do much more to accelerate progress in this regard within our country.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the four asks the witnesses have made, the first is to ensure more robust tracking of Ireland's progress in furthering the sustainable development agenda.  Will they elaborate in that regard?  <\/p> <p>  Another area in which I am very interested is Colombia.  I welcome the report on Colombia.  Other committee members and I have raised the matter of the serious issues within that country.  It is interesting to see how the situation is impacting on women in Colombia in particular.  I have made reference to certain statistics previously with regard to human rights defenders, including former members of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, and other community activists, who have been targeted since 2016.  This is a very useful report of which we, as committee members, should take heed and feed into our deliberations as we engage with some of the organisations that are also on the ground in Colombia and the Colombian ambassador to Ireland in the coming while.  We have also asked for an engagement with Eamon Gilmore, who has played a very important role in the peace process in Colombia.  The report is very welcome, albeit very stark.  It shows that more than 400 human rights defenders have been murdered since the peace process commenced.<\/p> <p>  The issues in Jordan are again very stark.  This committee did some important work last week in marking the grim fact of the tenth year of conflict within Syria and the human impact this has had with regard to displaced people in Jordan and other neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon.  It is really important to see the impact this conflict is having with regard to education and gender inequality.  I appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I have one final point to make.  It has regard to Covid, which has had a very serious impact globally.  Some of the statistics as to how it has unfortunately impacted more on women are very grim and very stark.  Again, this committee did some important work on the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine to developing countries.  We had some excellent contributors to our deliberations, including Dr. David Nabarro, Dr. Kieran Harkin and a number of other important people, who painted a  grim picture as to the inequality in the roll-out of vaccines.  Some stark information as to price was given.  Some pharmaceutical companies are making massive profits from the vaccines.  There is inequality involved.  For example, a dose of one of the vaccines costs &euro;2.50 in Europe but &euro;5.80 is charged in Uganda for the same dose.  One of the major calls made by all of those people with which we engaged, which was reflected in one of the key findings of the report the committee published, was that while COVAX is important in the roll-out of the vaccine to developing countries, the Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, is also important.<\/p><p>The latter is a platform that has been created to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 vaccines.  It is a voluntary scheme which would allow countries and pharmaceutical companies to develop the vaccine and roll it out.  I firmly believe there should be no profit made on the pandemic.  That was one of the key findings of the committee.  Have people on the ground in our guests' organisations looked at C-TAP in the context of the roll-out of Covid vaccines and the obvious disproportionate impact Covid is having on women across the world?  Another key finding of the committee was to call on the Government to sign up to C-TAP and encourage pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily sign up to it to share those intellectual rights such that all people, particularly those in less developed countries, can access the vaccine.<\/p><p> I again thank our guests for their contributions and for engaging with the committee.  I full support each of the four asks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#D00700","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I propose to take contributions and questions from Deputies and then return to Ms Van Lieshout and the rest of the panel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#E00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I thank our wonderful guests.  It is never easy to hear gender equality being spoken about at such length and its impact in the context of such a wide array of issues, but it exists and we cannot continue to hide from that existence because we will never have true human rights while gender inequality remains.  I have heard Covid-19 being referred to as a universal leveller.  However, it has not been a universal leveller.  Research has shown that women across the globe have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic compared with men.  One of the fundamental reasons for that is the gender inequalities that existed before Covid ever became a thing.  These gender inequalities are wide ranging.  There is the gender pay gap, the responsibility for family and childcare, the fact that front-line staff in some areas are predominantly female, but also the inadequate supports that were in place.<\/p> <p>  A recent piece of work by the European Institute for Gender Equality was quite startling.  It found that 4.5% of women's employment is at risk across the globe because of the pandemic, compared with 3.8% of men's employment.  Women make up 40% of the global labour force yet account for 54% of job losses to date.  Workers in industries such as retail, hospitality and residential care are predominantly women and those are the areas that have suffered the heaviest job losses to date.  Women make up the bulk of the workforce in those sectors and 40% of all jobs lost by women during the crisis were in these professions.<\/p> <p>  A report published last summer by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company described how women globally have been 1.8 times as likely as men to lose their jobs because of the pandemic.  It reported that societal attitudes have also shaped how women experience the economic fallout, based on their perceived place in society.  Despite the resurgence in employment during the summer months last year, men regained employment at twice the rate that women did, indicating that the economic impact of the pandemic will be felt much longer and harder by women compared with men.<\/p> <p>  When Ireland first went into lockdown last March, the caring responsibility was compounded in many ways by the efforts of some to be more accommodating of women.  For example, as a result of the gender pay gap, women's work often took less of a priority compared with men's work.  Employers were more understanding that women also had caring roles but, as a result of that and the priority that was given to male partners, women actually ended up working considerably longer hours every day just to meet those ever-increasing demands being made of them.  The National Women's Council of Ireland published a really good report on the impact on women's mental health and well-being of carrying the lion's share of the load in terms of work and caring in the home.<\/p> <p>  On the gender-based violence aspect, in three months last year there was a 40% increase in the number of applications for protection and barring orders compared with the same period the previous year.  The figures are stark.  There were 1,300 requests for refuge in domestic violence services that could not be met.   That is eight people per day whose requests for refuge went unanswered.<\/p> <p>  When we look at the future and coming out of Covid - we will come out of Covid at some point - there is no doubt that although women have been the hardest hit by the pandemic, they will also be the backbone of the recovery in their communities, circles and environments.  For that to happen, women's inclusion, representation, rights, social and economic outcomes, equality and protection must be at the core of national and global responses.  Financial stimulus packages and social assistance programmes must be based on greater equality, opportunities and social protection for women.  We must not allow Covid to be used as an excuse to reverse the little progress on gender equality that has been made.  Rather, it should become the catalyst to create something new that focuses on these pre-existing conditions and says \"No more\".  While the eyes of governments nationally and internationally are on these inequalities, there will never be a better time to address them or to implement policies that go to the core of what created the inequalities in the first place.  Covid simply shone a light on the extent of the inequalities that exist, inequalities that were there in my mother's time, my grandmother's time and my great-grandmother's time.  That is what I think needs to happen now.  When we look to the future and policies, we need to look to training, education and employment opportunities for women, the protection of activists and political representation.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of women's health, more than 30,000 women in Ireland alone are currently awaiting a gynaecological appointment.  When that is coupled with the waiting lists for BreastCheck and cervical cancer screening, we are looking at a potential perfect storm in terms of women's health in Ireland.  That is before looking elsewhere in Europe or across the globe where the disproportionate effect of conflict and other gender-based violence will have an even more profound effect.<\/p> <p>  What is needed now more than ever is that not only are women at the table in terms of future development, but that their voices are actually heard at that table.  I agree with our guests that tracking progress is absolutely vital because if it is not in place, plans become words on pages.  Without targets, focus and key performance indicators, gender equality will remain out of reach for future generations because there will not be any meaningful planned progress written down to be achieved.  I am sorry if all that comes across as a bit of a rant.  I fundamentally agree with the vast majority of what the representatives have stated.  In terms of tracking progress on gender equality, what would they like to see achieved in the next 18 months, three years and five years?  What is the best course of action for us to prioritise in the short term and the medium term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#E00300","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I am going to go back to Ms Van Lieshout now before I come back to members.

That has to be about women and girls.  We have not yet heard what that guidance looks like and what specifically they are going to do to make sure the policy really does make sure no one is left behind.  I urge the committee to ask questions around this policy to make sure it is very clear and that they are prioritising the right things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Before we go to Ms Finan, I will ask for some additional words on this question from my colleague, Ms Maeve Taylor, from the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I should clarify that I am representing the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, although we are the Irish collaborating partner of UNFPA, particularly for its State of World Population report launch, which will be happening soon.

It is an excellent policy and, from an IFPA perspective, one of the things we were happy to see was a very strong grounding of human rights and gender equality in that policy, with respect for sexual and reproductive health and rights in a way we had not seen previously in Irish Aid or Ireland's policy.<\/p> <p>  I spoke yesterday to a colleague in Ethiopia who was wholehearted in her respect for the way Irish Aid has integrated policy approaches, good critical analysis and brought sexual and reproductive health and rights into its work on sustainable development as a core aspect.

This is something that will give guidance and allow us a framework for accountability and monitoring and for critical engagement with Irish Aid to know how Ireland is pushing forward its strong and respected objectives around gender equality in the context of sexual and reproductive health and rights.

I thank the committee for endorsing the cause of the people's alliance for vaccine equity.  We were delighted to see the committee's recent report and support its calls.<\/p> <p>  The key point to note is that, globally, over 70% of the healthcare workforce are women.  A fact that is quite shocking is those women often face violence in performing their roles and there is a risk that is amplified over access to the finite resources of a Covid-19 vaccine.  The safety and security of those delivering Covid-19 vaccines must also be of utmost priority.  Other health crises have shown that delivery and facilitation of vaccines will depend disproportionately on the unpaid labour of women and girls and this will impact especially on the poorest and those in rural areas.  We know providing equitable access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines in low and middle-income countries will be a catastrophic moral failure if we do not do it.  It will impede progress towards ending this pandemic.  It will compound and deepen the setback to girls' and women's rights, leaving them further behind.  We are part of a network of organisations calling for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.  We strongly endorse the calls this committee has made and will happily provide any further information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for raising the issue of human rights defenders.  It is an important issue in many countries across the globe.  Front Line Defenders highlighted in 2020 that 333 human rights defenders were killed doing their work.  That is a very shocking figure.  These are the people who are often at the coalface of injustice.  They are often the ones who are working with communities, deeply embedded with them, fighting for issues such as gender equality, peace and human rights.  They are experiencing the most brutal forms of retaliation by being killed for the work they do.  I thank the Deputy for highlighting that important issue.<\/p> <p>  These matters arise in the broader context of global restrictions on civil society spaces.  Attacks on human rights defenders are not happening in isolation but are a part of a broader trend whereby states are bringing in increasingly restrictive and oppressive legislation and policy to restrict civil society's work more broadly.  Civicus has classified that in the past couple of years, 111 countries have brought in such restrictive legislation.  According to its categorisation, only 3.4% of the globe live in fully open civil society spaces.  That is a shocking fact to take back and consider in the context of how we see these issues.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has, of course, only made the situation worse because emergency powers have been introduced in a number of countries.  States have, unfortunately, used those emergency powers to restrict further the work of human rights defenders and civil society.  It is also important to highlight that there are gendered aspects to attacks on human rights defenders.  All human rights defenders experience particular attacks, but women experience different types of attacks because of the work that they do with communities and challenging social norms around gender inequality.<\/p><p>As well as the physical threats and killings that they face alongside male human rights defenders, they also face slurs about their name, stigmatisation, discrimination, sexual assault and sexual violence because of the work they do.  It is very important to note that these attacks, much like other levels of gender-based violence, can increase during conflict situations, so it is an important area.<\/p><p> In regard to what Ireland can do, I have been a champion of this around the civil society space and that has been very welcome through the various UN resolutions and initiatives that it has pushed there.  There is an opportunity with the ongoing membership of the UN Security Council because, in the Security Council, we are not seeing civil society systematically included and shaping the policies that have a huge and detrimental impact on their lives.  There is a very important way that Ireland can bring civil society and human rights defenders into the Security Council space.  Major decisions are being made about military responses in countries without consulting those human rights defenders and civil society actors.  One important thing they need to consider when doing that is that they factor in reprisals against human rights defenders who engage with the Security Council, and that they engage fully with UN guidelines on this to make sure human rights defenders do not experience further threats and attacks because of that advocacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Karol Balfe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I will hand back to the Chairman for further questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their responses so far.

It has been a very enlightening and provocative session.  I would like to hone in on a few areas.  The global point is that Covid has seriously exacerbated an already existing gender inequality.  I will deal first with women's participation in the workplace.  It is very clear that women are the greatest victims of displacement as the kind of jobs they are in, outside the front-line healthcare area, tend to be less well-paid and there is an in-built discrimination in areas like hospitality, which are the areas that have lost out.  Women have been displaced in employment right across the world, no less here than elsewhere.  It is a huge issue.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on what can be done.  There are two areas, the developing world and areas of conflict, and the more developed world, and the challenge is obviously greater in the former.  What would their comments be about retraining, education and long-term education?  There will be an issue.  One need not be an expert in economics to assume that quite a few of these jobs will not return in the medium term, so we will have a deficit and a spin-off.  Therefore, there is a need for retraining, for re-education and for new opportunities.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment around this, in particular how we might label our overseas development aid and demand that kind of thing in the developing world.  Can we also be in any way prescriptive in our own area?  Overall, women's participation in the workplace is a key issue.<\/p><p>Second, as all in this forum know, education is very important.  The witnesses gave us a very stark figure that 90,000 young female Syrian refugees did not participate in school or education last year.  That is a shocking statistic but I know it is only indicative and that it is repeated elsewhere.  I am inclined to be solutions-focused and we want to be solutions-focused in the way we do our committee work in that we want to make recommendations and ultimately effect change.  There is no difficulty or disagreement between us around the aims, objectives or ambitions and we are <i>ad idem<\/i>on that.  It is a question of how to resolve it.  Do the witnesses have suggestions as to how we could re-focus our overseas aid, make new demands or apply new criteria?  Is there much we can actively do to correct a wrong such as that cited in Jordan, and I know such wrongs are repeated all over the place?  Education is a huge issue.<\/p><p>I want to turn to the issue of domestic violence.  We are all getting anecdotal evidence around domestic violence.  It is a horrendous crime and a wrong that is with us perpetually, but it is clearly exacerbated by the Covid situation, with people being at home together and all that goes with that.  It is a real issue.  Without seeking to be parochial, in my own county, in Cavan town, we need a women's refuge.  The ideal would be that we did not need these things in the first instance but, sadly, we do.  We do not have one there and the nearest women's refuge is in Dundalk, so even in the developed western world, there is a clear need to tackle this question head-on.  When I attend policing committees, as all Oireachtas Members do at a local level, I am constantly getting statistics regarding an increase in domestic violence.  If it is bad here, it is clearly worse in many of the areas the witnesses are dealing with.  I am not sure if the witnesses can be prescriptive in this area as to what we might do.  We must unequivocally condemn this and we must be of one voice on that, needless to say.  However, how can we practically impact on the situation?  We can feel powerless in the face of such a global phenomena.<\/p><p>On another issue, the Chairman will be aware I have been raising this in other forums outside this committee, and it was raised earlier by Deputy Brady, so it has been addressed and I do not wish to labour it.  It is the issue of vaccine equality, which is a huge issue that links to the whole issue of gender inequality and to every other question, in particular the addressing of the Covid variants.  I support the concerns around that and I agree our Government should be out there on that.  As a committee, we have been very clear and prescriptive about that.  As a committee, we need to be very focused on getting some sort of outcomes from our work because there is not much point in having weekly meetings where we are platitudinous if we do not effect some outcomes, although it is a very amorphous kind of area.<\/p><p>It is a great discussion.  It is one of the tragic outcomes of Covid that it has exacerbated and set back progress on gender in quality.  We are witnessing the reversing of progress in health equality, gender equality and educational opportunity.  It is very sad that the entire equality agenda is a victim of Covid, on top of everything else.  Those are my thoughts.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  Well done to our guests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#G00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I know we have interim reviews of the performance of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, over the entire range of issues.  However, I wonder about the possibility or likelihood of putting something like FGM under the microscope and having a more urgent assessment of aspects of the SDGs, rather than await a full interim review.<\/p><p>Is there a possibility of an emergency look that would certainly ensure that these pretty stark changes to our targets could at least be mitigated if not entirely addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#G00500","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>The very short answer to Senator O'Reilly's question is that women need to be at the table in developing the response and recovery plans relating to Covid so that all of the various ways in which it has disproportionately impacted on them are appreciated in the recovery plan.

It is really hard to find accurate data and analyse that data.  We always face this problem when we try to analyse a certain problem or collect evidence.  The existing data shows that women are not participating in the workforce.  Jordan has one of the lowest rates globally in this area.  The unemployment rate for women in Jordan is very high and the employment rate for women is one of the lowest in the region and globally.  It is a complicated problem and we need to come up with comprehensive multidimensional solutions.  Education is part of it.  We need to redirect education to respond to market needs.  We also need to work on raising awareness among families and communities about the need to give more space to women to participate, to get out and to be engaged economically because many women report that they are not allowed to do so by family members, husbands or elderly people in the family.<\/p> <p>  It is also about enforcing laws and legislation that relate to workplace safety and safeguarding in the workplace.  For example, we do not have systems for reporting harassment in the workplace.  We cannot capture the data.  Women do not report it.  There is no system for reporting.  It is a complicated problem and we need to come up with comprehensive solutions.  Education is key.  We all know that it is life-changing and life-saving but we need to direct our education programmes to be responsive to market needs.  Covid gave us a lot of learning opportunities such as using technology and being connected on a national level to training courses and programmes women do not need to attend physically because transport is expensive and sometimes it is not safe to travel from one place to another.  Technology is giving us a lot of opportunity but so far, it has been underutilised.  It can be life-changing for women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Muna Abbas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":661,"content":"<p>Regarding the Chairman's question about whether we should be thinking about a specific report to bring some urgency to this issue, it is worth saying in respect of the SDGs that in the past, there has been this idea of a spotlight report.  We know that next year, Ireland must offer its voluntary national review at the high-level political forum.  Is this another opportunity to say \"Let's focus on this issue of gender\"?<\/p> <p>  In response to the question from Deputy Clarke, it is really about what we should prioritise.  As we have seen here, there is no magic bullet nor is there any quick fix.  We know it is complicated and that a range of responses are needed.  If I dare attempt to think about how to prioritise over the next 18 months, a few things that have already been touched on come to mind.  First, we are in this Covid environment and the vaccine issue must be brought to the fore.  The phrase \"We're in the same storm but different boats\" is really important.  We know that unless we are all safe, nobody is safe.  As has already been said, the issue of vaccines is so important and we have to get it right now.<\/p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that in terms of Irish Aid and what Ireland is doing on the UN Security Council, it is championing the right things.  It does have these very good policies in place.  We also know that Frances Fitzgerald, MEP, is doing a great job at EU level around the gender action programme and really promoting those issues at EU level.  The problem is not lack of policies; it is lack of implementation.  This is what we really need to focus on.  It involves tracking and questioning of where the progress is and what the measurements are over time periods.  Let us not forget that with these policies, we also need to recommit to funding.  This involves funding of overseas development aid and funding around specific gender programmes if we are to implement these policies.<\/p> <p>  My third priority is collaboration on so many different levels.  In 2018 - perhaps some members of this committee were there - Ireland led an international caucus of female parliamentarians.  That was an amazing experience where we saw that learning from Ireland, America and Europe, but also from Africa.  It was so rich and important and will surely help us speed up some of these processes.  We have seen today that collaboration between NGOs, members of this committee and politicians.<\/p> <p>  The final issue I would prioritise is the need for us to keep collaborating in order to keep the conversation very live in the public space among the Irish population and globally through interactions like this one.  It involves really engaging at constituency level and getting engaged with the national conversation around gender equality.  These are four things I would prioritise.  I am sure there are more.  I will hand over to other colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":662,"content":"<p>Ms Taylor and Ms Winstanley will join us to speak about the questions on gender-based violence and GM.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":663,"content":"<p>In response to the question from Senator Joe O'Reilly and the comments from the Chairman about FGM, the Irish Family Planning Association runs an FGM treatment clinic funded by the HSE for women in Ireland who have experienced FGM.  When we look at the issues of girls in education, women in the workforce and issues like FGM and child marriage, I am prompted to think about some of the titles of United Nations Population Fund reports in recent years that have focused on girls at ten years of age and adolescent pregnancy.  In focusing on how we get women to the table, we must look back at the lives of girls and how we ensure girls can stay in education, are safe from gender-based violence and are not grappling with unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections such as HIV when they are adolescents but are able to plan their lives and futures.  One of the core issues is access to reproductive health services and information and sexuality education.  In 2019, we held a civil society dialogue in advance of the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development..<\/p><p>At a time when we used to be able to pack rooms with people and have them thronging around tables - it seems like a very long time ago now - at every single table there were individuals working on development issues and thematic issues relating to the LGBT community.  Those people included youth and health workers, and policy influencers.  At one point, everyone in the room was talking about sexuality education.  They were discussing issues such as their experience of poor sexuality education in Ireland as young people, their frustration about their children not having access to quality education in schools now or their understanding of the ways in which denial of sexuality education globally impacts on a girls' capacity to flourish.  Focusing in on those issues relating to girls and adolescents and how we build forward better and get women to the table is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":665,"content":"<p>In addressing the issue relating to Colombia, I will provide some statistics in order that the committee can understand how prevalent conflict-related sexual violence was.  The constitutional court in Colombia said that it was a systematic practice.  Oxfam undertook two studies which show that between 2000 and 2009 there were 149 cases per day of sexual violence in armed conflict.  When it then did a follow-up study in 2010 to 2015, it found that there were 400 cases of sexual violence against women in conflicts each day.  What is worth noting here is that the second study showed that the increase occurred during peace talks.  We know definitely that sexual violence in conflict and domestic violence is a continuum between this kind of violence.  They are inextricably linked because of the kind of male attitudes which perpetrate this violence.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that the women particularly addressed during the peace talks and which they put firmly on the agenda was that there was a need in the transitional justice system to ensure that there were no amnesties for conflict-related sexual violence.  This is the first peace accord in the world which stated that there should be no amnesties.  One of the difficulties now is to completely ensure that there are no amnesties for conflict-related sexual violence.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that women are asking for in particular - this is really key at this moment because if the committee is going to visit Colombia, it is one of the asks that I would have - is that there be a discussion of the fact that there needs to be a national case in the transitional justice system on conflict-related sexual violence.  This would be essential if we are to really see that there are no amnesties and that the issue of sexual violence is taken very seriously.  If this does not happen, it is going to be very difficult to change male attitudes on violence towards women.  This is a key ask that I would like to put on the committee&rsquo;s agenda when it visits Colombia.

I also acknowledge the work that Ireland continues to do with the UN, notwithstanding our membership of the Security Council, but also in its hosting of recent meetings on the matter of girls' education and acknowledging the fact that during the pandemic alone, almost 20 million girls have been denied schooling and have left education.  There continue to be an enormous number, some 130 million girls, out of school worldwide, and I stress the importance of education.  I thank Ms Abbas for her focus, particularly on Jordan and Lebanon, having regard to the refugee situation there and the need to ensure that education standards are kept up.  She spoke about online education and courses and ensuring that they are of a certain standard that will allow for a situation where school accreditations are given and that education can be resumed at some stage in the future.<\/p> <p>  Unless our witnesses would like to come back in to comment further on any of those points, I will ask Ms Van Lieshout to proceed to her closing comments.

In some very brief closing remarks, I want to thank the committee for giving us this chance to share with it some of these stories.  We are all very much on the same page in that we cannot afford to allow Covid-19 to get in the way of the urgent issue of gender equality.  As has been stated, Covid-19 has exacerbated and accelerated the trends.  There is a real urgency around this issue.<\/p> <p>  I also thank the D&oacute;chas members for sharing some of their stories and these very stark facts.  As Ms Taylor said, there have been 13 million more child marriages as a result of Covid-19 over a 12-month period, which is just extraordinary.  Ms Abbas said that there is an entire generation at risk in Jordan and in the Middle East in general because of a lack of education.  We know that many of those girls will not go back to education at all.  That potential of those women and girls is lost for an entire generation.<\/p> <p>  We also heard from Christian Aid about the impact of conflict.  I am aware that the committee had a session on Syria where the issue of gender-based violence and the use of women as weapons of war was very starkly put forward during those sessions.<\/p> <p>  We also heard that we cannot afford the luxury of being overwhelmed by this.  As Deputy Clarke said so well, we know that women are going to be the backbone of the recovery.  For that to happen, they need to be at the table and to be those leaders we have seen in our own communities.  We need to find the way and the space to bring them to the table and to hear their voices.<\/p> <p>  I will make one positive comment about the pandemic in that it has allowed the committee to be here this morning to hear different voices from the field and from the wide range of D&oacute;chas's NGOs, which I really appreciate.  Let us hope that we can keep doing that more.  The solution is going to come from these conversations by bringing different people together.  We can see that with that stronger collaboration, I genuinely believe that we can go faster and make that difference.<\/p> <p>  The outcome that I needed from the session today was to hear from the committee members that they will be our champions on gender equality, on the SDGs and on the importance of ODA and Irish Aid's work.<\/p><p>I hope the committee members will go away with some practical takeaways.  We are very open to exploring more and I reiterate the idea concerning the SDGs and the Spotlight report, and there being some more practical and specific things we can work on together.  We are happy to carry on that conversation.  I also refer to the informal session we had with the committee last week.  We ran out of time then, but I hope the members will agree that one of the key things we put on the table and one of the key policy asks of D&oacute;chas members was gender.  There were many more concerns, however, so I hope we will get the chance to work with the committee members in that regard.  <\/p><p> More importantly, I hope today the members got a sense of the important role that Irish NGOs are playing, as well as the important role of the diversity of the D&oacute;chas membership.  My team and I are here and available if the committee members have questions and if there are issues that they want to tackle more and bring such a conversation together.  We are grateful for this opportunity this morning and let us hope we can continue this partnership.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee and all the panellists at this morning's session.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keatinge.

It is clear from the contributions this morning, our engagement and the international reporting community that the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on women and girls is a matter of deep concern.  It is most worrying, whether those impacts are in the areas of health, education and-or food security and nutrition or in the context of gender-based violence.  The impact of Covid-19, while not yet fully assessed, is most stark, and that is why this committee felt our engagement this morning was so important.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt that this is an issue that the members of this committee will be returning to, and I note the interest of Deputy Clarke and others.

I welcome members to the committee.  I also welcome the bank officials, Ms Francesca McDonagh and Mr. Gavin Kelly.  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss in general the topic of banking matters with the representatives.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings a witness physically present would.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind them of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit - Leinster House on this occasion - in order to participate in public proceedings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms McDonagh to make her opening remarks.  The opening statement which she has submitted can be taken as read and she can add some comments now, if she wishes.  The members have been asked to keep their contributions tied to the questions they want to ask.  We have only two hours and there are 15 members wishing to contribute.  In terms of the questions asked, I ask that Ms McDonagh would give a direct answer in order to save time and not to answer questions that have been asked previously, so we can get as many members as possible to participate in the meeting.

Hopefully, everyone can hear me loud and clear.  I am pleased to be joined today by my colleague, Mr. Gavin Kelly, CEO of our retail Ireland business.  I very much hope we can be of assistance to the committee today.  I am conscious that we bring a particular perspective to today's session being the only majority privately owned Irish retail bank.  We circulated a longer opening statement in advance.  I will, therefore, address the key points in that statement in my opening comments.<\/p> <p>  Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of the introduction of broad restrictions on the Irish economy arising from Covid-19.  As a leading lender to the Irish economy, we felt a strong sense of duty to respond quickly to support our customers and the wider economy.<\/p> <p>  At the outset of the pandemic, we moved at speed to proactively introduce a range of supports for our customers.  For example, Bank of Ireland put in place more than 100,000 payment breaks across the group, and of these, 97% of customers have returned to pre-Covid-19 terms with only a small number requiring further support.<\/p> <p>  Like any business, Covid-19 has presented challenges for Bank of Ireland.  I want to take a moment to outline our 2020 financial results.  We believe this context is very relevant to our discussion today.  Ensuring our business model is appropriately profitable and sustainable is absolutely critical if we are to attract and retain investors, generate capital that can be lent into the Irish economy and reinvest in the business to ensure our long-term competitiveness and viability.<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is unique among Irish banks in being the only institution to have fully repaid the Irish taxpayer, which we did in 2013.  This support from the taxpayer was vitally important during the financial crisis and was gratefully received.  It should never have been needed, however.  That is why Bank of Ireland made it an absolute priority to repay the Irish taxpayer as quickly as possible.  To date, Bank of Ireland has returned &euro;6 billion to the State, delivering a &euro;1.2 billion net cash return to taxpayers.  Over the past three years, &euro;40 million in dividends have also been paid by Bank of Ireland to the State.<\/p> <p>  The State&rsquo;s continued 14% shareholding in the group, which is held at the discretion of the shareholder, as is the case with any investor, will represent an additional return to the Irish taxpayer whenever it is sold.  The same is true for any future dividends paid out to shareholders.  I mention this by way of illustration of the unique nature of our position in the Irish retail banking market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our most recent financial results, 2020 was a challenging year, with Bank of Ireland announcing a &euro;374 million underlying loss before tax.  The bank, however, saw a stronger performance in the second half of the year and a return to profitability.<\/p> <p>  When we presented our annual results on 1 March, we also announced a range of significant changes to our branch network and to the provision of local banking services to our customers.  In addition to the reduction in our branch network, we announced a new partnership with An Post to be launched in the coming months and in advance of any branch closures.  This will enable all our customers to access banking services at more than 900 post office locations across Ireland in addition to our branch network.<\/p> <p>  This is the first significant change to the bank&rsquo;s physical footprint in almost a decade whereas other banks have significantly reduced the size of their branch network in the preceding years.  This change reflects the reality that we have reached an inescapable tipping point in customer preference between online and offline banking.  We are, however, fully aware that changes like this can be of concern to some customers, especially those living or working in rural communities.  Bank of Ireland will, therefore, continue to invest in a strong nationwide presence of 169 branches and, of course, we will also continue to offer mobile and telephone banking for all our customers.<\/p> <p>  Many changes are confronting the banking industry.  As a country, we all need a profitable and sustainable banking sector to support ongoing growth and lending, especially as the economy recovers post Covid.  A once in a lifetime process of change is under way in banking right now, not just in Ireland but across Europe, and indeed, the global banking sector.<\/p> <p>  The decision of NatWest to withdraw from the Irish market reflects the realities of a challenged sector and has thrust the dynamics of Ireland&rsquo;s banking sector further into the spotlight.  Our belief is that the continued attraction of private capital into the sector and the economy is the critical path to ensuring a sustainable, robust and more normalised retail banking sector.<\/p> <p>  In closing, the history of Irish banking, and the role banks had in Ireland's financial crisis of the past, is understood.  The economic impact of the pandemic today on Irish businesses and households is recognised.  We have been proactive in our support for customers during Covid-19.  The focus of my team and me, however, is equally on the future of Ireland's economy, banking sector and the role Bank of Ireland can play over the next decade in Ireland's development.  We are looking at am imminent period of recovery and growth.  To enable the financial well-being of Irish households and businesses, an improved relationship between our sector and the State is overdue.  As a leading lender to the Irish economy, Bank of Ireland wants to play a central role in this discussion about our collective future.  I will be happy to now respond to any of the committee's comments or questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>For the information of members, Deputies Doherty and Barry, Senator Higgins and Deputy Richmond will speak.

Those with conditions that were never factored in in the past, for example, diabetes and obesity, are now being refused mortgage protection by insurance companies such as New Ireland Assurance, and a wide range of others.  These are families who have saved for years to get a deposit for a house, and who have got approval to draw down a mortgage.  Now, however, the pandemic is being used to state they are riskier applicants and therefore cannot fulfil their legal requirement to get insurance.  This is connected.

It concerns the appalling decision to close down one third of the branch network right across the State.  I want to put on the record again that the Bank of Ireland exists today because of the taxpayers of this State, who bailed it out at a time when it collapsed because of the reckless behaviours of bankers before Ms McDonagh's time.  It exists today because of that sacrifice the Irish people made and now, in the time of a pandemic as we have just discussed, the response from Bank of Ireland is to withdraw those services in the communities.<\/p> <p>  Ms McDonagh will be aware that the Financial Conduct Authority in Britain has asked banks not to close branches during the pandemic for a most important reason, namely, because those who might want to move to digital access may not be in a position to get that support in-branch because they are cocooning.  However, the Bank of Ireland group has decided to ignore that.  It is closing 15 branches in the North and 88 branches in the South.  There are vulnerable people who are cocooning and who will not be able to leave their houses to go to the branch to get help to go online.  My view is that the group used Covid as a dummy run for this process, when during the first wave a similar number of branches were closed under the guise of the pandemic.  In recent weeks, the bank has announced that basically, the same number of branches and most of the same branches will be closed.  Is there anything that the Minister for Finance, as the major shareholder in the Bank, could say to encourage the group to at least delay this until after the pandemic is over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#C01000","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>The way the Deputy has described our decision is not how I would entirely characterise our approach.  I will respond factually.  First, as I said in my opening statement, we were very grateful for the support of the taxpayers, which we have repaid more than in full, over eight years ago.  However, I appreciate and recognise the history of banking.  On our current and future practices, we need to respond to the changes in our customers' preferences.  The Deputy will understand that that is how a well-run business should act.<\/p> <p>  We have announced the closure of 88 branches in the Republic of Ireland and 15 in Northern Ireland.  None will be closed until September.  In parallel with that announcement, we have announced a partnership with An Post.  We already have a partnership with the Post Office in Northern Ireland.  That will provide all of our customers with access to their 900 outlets.  The reason we are doing this is because there has been a seismic shift in customer behaviour to which we must respond.  Yes, it is one third of our branch network but I can assure the Deputy that it is not one third of our footfall.  If anything, those branches have been rarely visited.  Three out of four customers of those branches have not set foot in them within the past year.  Maybe that is partly because of the pandemic but if one looks at the two years preceding the pandemic, one sees the overall footfall in branches across our network reduced by 25%.  At the same time, we have seen a significant take-up in mobile usage.  As the Deputy will be aware, we launched a new mobile app in 2020 with a 50% increase in functionality.  Since we launched it, we have had an increase of over 26% in take-up.  Therefore, there has been a shift in how our customers want to engage in banking.  It has been expedited by the pandemic but it is a process that has been ongoing for probably the last decade.  We have responded to customer preference in our decision to close branches.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister for Finance is obviously a key stakeholder in the bank.  The State owns a 14% minority shareholding.  The Minister has said on public record that it is not his responsibility to influence or impact commercial decisions that are taken by the bank.  We have taken those commercial decisions in reflection of customer behaviour.

Obviously, I am here to talk about Bank of Ireland, but that is in the public domain.  I will keep this quite generic because it is just not appropriate for me to talk about a third party whose process has not started.  If Bank of Ireland were to acquire an entity in which bonuses and variable remuneration are paid in a normalised way, as in the case of every other non-Irish bank and corporate entity in Ireland, and it is only Irish banks that have this restriction, then I would certainly look at opportunities to normalise pay.  Even if there is no acquisition, in our annual report - and I appreciate the Deputy has a response to this - there was a letter from our group chairman that referred to the need to revisit normalisation of remuneration.  We have repaid the taxpayer in full.  Irish banks are severely restricted and treated uncompetitively compared with our normal Irish peers, with whom we compete for talent and customers here in Ireland, and with other banks in Europe and the UK and other Irish entities, with which we compete for digital, finance and customer service skills.  I appreciate, given where the economy is now, that to talk about bankers' bonuses is highly contentious.  If, however, I just step back and think about the future and the recovery of this economy, having Irish-only banks restricted in a way in which other banks in Ireland are not is anti-competitive and makes it very difficult for us to retain and attract key talent, which we need for a profitable and sustainable Irish banking sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I have limited time and I just want to be clear on what is being said.

Those outcomes are related not just to profit but also to whether or not staff are achieving customer satisfaction targets and whether or not they are doing the right thing as far as risk management is concerned.  Varying people's pay based on performance can be a very good thing if applied appropriately.  There are new European Banking Authority regulations that are very clear.  We are one of, I think, very few banks in the European Union that still face restrictions.  The Deputy's summary is right, however.

In Ms McDonagh's responses she talked about the money the Irish public contributed in the bank bailout being repaid.  It is really important to be clear that while the money may have been repaid, the cost of the impact of austerity, the impact on people's lives - young lives - and five or ten years of missed opportunities and lost services has not been repaid.  I will be frank.  I am quite shocked to see there is a push for \"normalisation\", as it is being framed.  It is not normal that we would have such a huge level of pay into the financial sector through the effective removal of the pay cap and the reintroduction of excessive pay incentives.  The message I hear today is that we need to tighten our action and legislation on this in order that we do not see loopholes being exploited because clearly they will be.<\/p> <p>  The issue I really want to focus on, however, is the branch closures that have been announced.  Ms McDonagh has framed this as a response to the digital demand, but we need to be clear.  We know from EU statistics from just last year that 47% of the Irish public lack basic digital skills.  That is the statistic from an EU analysis.  Ireland is not a place where every single person has a smartphone in his or her hand.  That is a bit of a myth.  In that regard I am very concerned about the branch closures.  What consultation will Bank of Ireland have with local communities on the branches?  I think over 100 branches across the island might be closed.  What social impact assessment or environmental impact assessment has been done of the longer distances and the longer wait times to access services?  What engagement is there with local authorities on landmark buildings?  Many Bank of Ireland branches are anchor or landmark buildings in towns across Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As for the post office proposal, is it Ms McDonagh's understanding that there will be a reversal of the planned 200 post office closures in respect of this deal?  When she talks about the 900 post offices, does she anticipate that this partnership will in fact reverse post office closures in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The engagement with trade unions has been very disappointing from their perspective.  What measures are in place to engage with trade unions?  Is it the case that at the moment permanent staff who take voluntary redundancy are being replaced with temporary staff?  Those questions relate to the branch closures.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, has the bank sold ATMs in the past year?  Can Ms McDonagh confirm the bank's plans in respect of its network of ATMs across Ireland?  That is a part of that service also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#D01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>There were a few questions there.

There is a need for increased digital education, but that has been progressing.  I am not sure what data the Senator is referring to.<\/p><p>We have seen that change.  Today, 70% of our entire customer base is digitally active.  We have seen satisfaction in our digital channels increase by 25 points in the past year.  This is not just an age issue where it is just younger customers.  Over half of customers of 60 years and older are registered online and two-thirds of them were active in the last three months.

The Senator referred to comments made by the Irish Postmasters' Union on the potential closure of post offices.  The issue has not come up in our engagement with the post office to date.  We believe the contract we are signing with the post office goes to ensuring the viability of post offices into the future by bringing another service to postmasters.  That is where we see the benefit for them.  From our perspective, it makes sure we bridge the digital divide so that customers who want to avail of lodgements and withdrawals can do so in the network of post offices around the country.  We believe the 900 post offices currently operating give ample coverage, particularly in the locations where we are closing.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on properties, the Senator is correct.  We have a number of landmark buildings around the country.  A substantial number of the 88 properties are landmark buildings and many of them are large, for example, some of them have living quarters upstairs where the branch manager used to live.  The Senator will be familiar with that.  There is quite a bit of space in these properties that could be availed of for community use in the future.  We have received a lot of expressions of interest from various community groups, credit unions and local businesses seeking to set up remote working hubs in their towns, right up to Departments and county councils.  We are open to engaging on these buildings.  We have already had extensive discussions and these will continue over the next six months.  We are not closing any of these properties, which will remain as bank branches for the next six months.  Post September, we will make sure the buildings are maintained until we have reached agreement with prospective buyers on the best use of the properties going forward.  In four of the 88 locations we will retain an ATM and maintain the buildings because there is no alternative ATM in the towns in question.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's final question on ATMs, just before Christmas we sold 700 ATMs to a company called Euronet.  These were all ATMs that were based in stores and shops.  Euronet is a professional services ATM company and ATMs are its only business.  It focuses on maintaining specific retailer ATMs that provide an important service.  We sold our ATM network in shops to Euronet.  Our commitment is to maintain ATMs in the 169 branch locations that we are retaining.  We will also retain four specific ATMs in certain towns where there is no alternative access to an ATM facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>May I respond to the NPE question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Richmond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond offline to the Senator's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>It would be great to get a written answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E00800","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Richmond want to ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E00900","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh and Mr. Kelly for joining us this afternoon.  This meeting is a welcome opportunity.  I will try to avoid repeating questions that have already been asked.  I will begin by following up on a set of questions Deputy Doherty asked concerning mortgages for people with underlying conditions.  I have a concern because it has been reported and, indeed, denied by the Bank of Ireland and other banks that applicants for mortgages have been either refused a mortgage or have been unable to draw down their mortgages because their employers are participating in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  I appreciate that the claim has been denied by Bank of Ireland and that these matters are correctly dealt with on a case-by-case basis, an approach the Minister for Finance has encouraged.  How many mortgages have been approved by Bank of Ireland in the past 12 months and how many of those have been drawn down?  How do those figures compare with the previous 12 months, taking Covid into consideration?

We have done that by being competitive in terms of our servicing.  We have not changed our pricing structure.

We have increased our market share because we have worked with brokers and improved our turnaround times.  We now have over 50% of first-time buyers who get end-to-end approval and drawdown on their mortgage digitally.  Those sorts of service initiatives are central to our business model.<\/p> <p>  In terms of excluding customers for any particular reason, we look at customers on a case-by-case basis.  It is not in the interests of anyone, either the customer, the bank, the State or the economy, to have banks provide mortgages that are not sustainable for individuals who then find themselves in financial distress.

I will move to a wider question which she touched on in her opening remarks and in the notes she presented.  The future of the Irish banking sector has been an underlying theme not just in this engagement but in all our engagements.  We have gone through a tumultuous number of weeks in which a long-standing service provider announced it is to leave the market.  The system of banking is changing rapidly.  The closure of branches, regardless of whether we like or whether it is modernisation or something else, is devastating for many communities.  We have also heard rumours that there are other concerns for other institutions.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the issue I am about to raise is one for the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on it to the Minister and I have tried to ask the Central Bank the same question a number of times.  What is the future of the Irish banking sector?  Why are banks not coming into this market?  What is so unattractive about the Irish market?  How do we provide more options for customers?  I know Ms McDonagh does not necessarily want to hear about competition but people on the street want to know where they can get cheaper mortgages, cheaper lending and perhaps a different type of service.  What is the future of the sector?  What opportunities and challenges does Brexit present to the entire banking and financial services sector?<\/p><p>I appreciate Ms McDonagh has two minutes to answer two big questions, but perhaps she could give a minute or two of insight on where she sees her bank going in those areas in the future and what ordinary people like me and many other committee members who happen to be customers of Bank of Ireland can expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E01200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I realise I am not going to do that very good question justice, but I certainly would want to be part of an ongoing discussion about the future of Irish banking, as I said in my opening statement.  I will outline what I see as the three challenges facing the European banking sector which are not unique to Ireland and I will outline a couple that are more unique to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  First, there is a need for digital investment across all banks in Europe and the UK because of customer preference.  That requires investment and the cost to digitise and modernise banks and to remain competitive against new entrants into the banking market.  The second is a lower for longer interest rate environment and in the European case negative interest rate environment.  Traditionally, banks have made revenue from holding excess deposits or at least having a cost for holding deposits.  That has now changed and it is an expense for a bank to hold deposits.  Some of those we pass on to larger deposit customers, and we can talk about that, but that is a reality that has significantly reduced revenue streams for all European banks.  The third, and perhaps this is not common across all of Europe but it is for some markets, is muted credit formation.  Part of that is uncertainty about Brexit and part of it is Covid-related.  Some of it will be dissipated, hopefully, by economic recovery and Brexit in the rear view mirror, but there has been muted credit formation, particularly in Ireland.  Banks are losing money on deposits and they are not necessarily growing their lending books.<\/p> <p>  Two features are specific to Irish banking.  One is size.  There are two big banks, although in a relatively small market.  Retail requires scale and economies of scale.  That is why one may see that smaller banks in a small market are not able to achieve minimum profitability hurdles and they may divest.  We have seen that over the years.<\/p> <p>  The last point I wish to make, which is quite topical, is the relatively high-risk ratings attached to Irish lending because of the last global financial crisis.  That means more capital must be held for every euro that is loaned, for example, for an Irish mortgage.  That results in a higher level of pricing in mortgages.  Irish banking may have relatively high mortgage pricing but that does not necessarily mean it is profitable.<\/p> <p>  As a result of all of the above, the Irish banking sector is challenged in achieving the type of returns that shareholders expect over a period of time.  Our response to that is to innovate and digitise, which we are doing, be more cost-efficient, and we have done that, and grow.  Up to the Covid pandemic we were growing our lending book and I very much hope to support the growth and recovery of the Irish market.  There is also diversification of income, such as growing our wealth and insurance business, and increasing the profitability of our UK subsidiary.  Those are the challenges we face.  I would be happy to continue the discussion with the benefit of more time at the Deputy's convenience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh and Mr. Kelly for attending and for their submission to the committee.  I have three questions about bank closures, staff and the relationship with An Post.  In my constituency of Wicklow, Bank of Ireland has decided to close three branches in Carnew, Tinahely and Rathdrum.  They are three vibrant and strong communities in south Wicklow.  Many rural towns and villages have been given a new lease of life with working from home, and many companies are saying that people can work from home permanently.  It brings an added vibrancy to those towns and villages, and brings greater footfall.<\/p> <p>  However, the bank's decision in that area is a blow to that part of Wicklow.  Customers and businesses there have an intergenerational relationship with those bank branches.  Businesses have had a relationship with the bank for three or four generations.  The cluster of banks Bank of Ireland is going to remove from that area will deprive the area of a basic necessity for a community, which is a bank branch in the locality.  It is at a time when those areas need that flexibility, support and the continued relationship they have built up with the bank over generations.  Flexibility and support are needed by many local businesses and communities as we emerge from Covid.  They are under tremendous pressure.<\/p> <p>  I understand the pressures Bank of Ireland is under with online banking.  The bank drove that as well, because it asked people to go online and it provided that facility.  I understand the pressures of that, but Bank of Ireland has removed branches from areas that do not have a very good broadband connection, particularly in rural parts of south Wicklow.  That is a problem.  The bank is expecting people to use online banking, but they are in areas that do not have good broadband at present.<\/p> <p>  Will Bank of Ireland reassess the closure of some rural branches based on the positive impact, if there can be a positive impact, that Covid might have on those rural towns and communities and the Government's policy on towns first and the drive towards the regeneration and revitalisation of rural towns and villages?  It could even be for a reduced number of hours.  Could the bank look at all those rural branches and especially that cluster in Wicklow?  The bank has created a void in Wicklow where people have no bank branch at all.  National broadband is being rolled out over the next two to three years.  Would the bank consider holding back on closing some of those branches until that banking catchment has high-quality access to broadband, to bridge the digital divide that exists whereby people do not have access to broadband?<\/p> <p>  The third issue is the staff.  Does the bank provide an opportunity to staff in those branches to upskill to other areas within the bank, such as the back-office systems, IT operations or other developing areas of banking as the banking model changes?  Is that the first option the bank would offer to those staff?<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to An Post.  We have all received communications from the postmasters.  Bank of Ireland suggests there is an offering in that regard, whereby An Post could provide that offering for transactions.  Will the bank be directly involved in those negotiations with An Post?  Many of the postmasters tell us that the return they get from offering those services is inadequate.  We are seeing bank branches closing down and unless the postmasters get a return for providing that service, we will see rural post offices close down as well.  If An Post is to provide those services, it must be adequately resourced and paid for doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#F00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Deputy's first questions as to whether we would reassess and our views on the challenges of national broadband coverage.  I will ask Mr. Kelly to talk about the specifics of Wicklow, how we are supporting colleagues in the branches that are due to close, whether in Wicklow or more broadly, and the An Post discussion.<\/p> <p>  We will not reassess closures.  I will explain why.  We have not taken this decision lightly.  We have looked at the behaviours and preferences of our customers over a long period of time, even before the Covid pandemic.  I will give the Deputy a perspective on all the customers in the 88 branches that will be closed.  Three out of four of them have not set foot in the branch in the last 12 months.  There has been a seismic reduction in volumes since even before Covid.  We are not in the business of closing busy branches.  We are responding to a shift in customer behaviour.  I know it is disappointing for communities, but it is not a surprise that people are shifting to online consumption, whether that is of entertainment, groceries or how we buy many things, including banking.  Obviously, there is an element in local villages and towns of a re-emergence, with people working from home, and nearly 80% of our colleagues are working from home, of people who will shop local or go local.  However, we are seeing, particularly as the country reopens, that people are keen to get back into pubs, restaurants, cinemas and local gyms, but they are not necessarily looking forward to going back to bank branches.  They have already migrated to a more digital experience.  It is a little like the fact that once one discovers Netflix, one will not necessarily go back to DVDs.  We see that shift as permanent and established.  We have not come to this decision lightly.  We have looked at a great deal of analysis and at footfall trends over a number of years.<\/p><p>That is how we got to this decision, which I appreciate is a difficult one.  We think it is a reflection of customer demand.<\/p><p> On national broadband, I appreciate that there may be challenges.  After the closures, our network will contain 169 branches, 103 of which are located outside the main urban city centres.  It is not the case that branches will only be seen in urban areas and not in rural Ireland.

I understand where the Deputy is coming from in terms of the impact on communities.  The deal with An Post is key for us because we have seen usage in all three locations drop over the last number of years.  There are 23 post offices and five remaining Bank of Ireland branches in County Wicklow.  Carnew, Rathdrum and Tinahely are closer to locations in Wexford as well, so we have ensured good coverage so customers have access to a branch and to a post office.  In the three locations in question, the distance between some of the post offices and the three branches is less than 100 yds.  That is an important factor in our decision but we will work with the groups involved.  The other thing that is important is that while the branch might be closing, our support for the community will not change in terms of business advisers and youth advisers doing education in schools, for example.  All those supports will continue in Wicklow and in all others all counties as they are today for the next number of years.<\/p> <p>  I cannot comment on the relationship directly between An Post and the postmasters but I will give a view.  I am involved in the negotiations on the contract with An Post.  As a number of these services are added together, they get a scale effect for the postmasters.  We are contributing to that but the committee would have to talk to the post office about the contract they have directly with postmasters.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious of the impact on staff.  As Ms McDonagh said, there will be no compulsory redundancies for staff.  We have invested significantly in upskilling staff over the last year.  A number of staff have been helping and supporting our contact centres, which can now be supported from working from home, or they can reallocate to other branches.  Staff have that choice and we are working through it with them ahead of the change in September.  Staff will be protected during this change.  If they want voluntary redundancy, we have that available since last year and will support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I will follow up the questions relating to An Post, specifically in respect of the level of engagement and analysis done in terms of post offices.

The gender pay gap currently stands at 23.8%, which is a slight improvement year on year.

I thank Ms McDonagh for the presentation so far.  The line that hops off it for me is the one which states: &quot;We stand alone as the only majority privately owned Irish retail bank.&quot;  That is the elephant in the room here.  It shows the continuing disaster, which is the Irish banking market, that we are so amiss with competition within this particular sector.  Mario Draghi said that the Irish banking market is a quasi-monopoly.  He is not far wrong on that.  That quasi-monopoly status allows Bank of Ireland to operate in the manner that it does because customers have no option in many ways but to do business with Bank of Ireland in the manner they do.<\/p><p>Ms McDonagh mentioned the transition of people from physical banking to online banking but I would posit that Bank of Ireland has actively sought to push people out of bank branches in the past number of years.  Seven or ten years ago there would have been ten spaces for people to work with tellers.  That was very quickly reduced to one and people were left 20 deep in queues trying to get near the teller and so on.  There was an active project to reduce customers coming into banks in the past number of years and that has, in part, led to the transition to online banking.<\/p><p>The cuts in the number of bank branches in the country are savage and they will have a savage effect on Irish society.  It is deeply disappointing given the quasi-monopoly position Bank of Ireland has within the particular sector.  My first question is on the differential in the mortgage interest rate in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>that in other European countries.  Ms McDonagh mentioned capital requirements and the risk effect in part accounting for that differential.  What proportion of differential is accounted for through capital requirements and the risk effect?  Does Bank of Ireland's quasi-monopoly status also add to that differential?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#H01100","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":746,"content":"<p>With respect, I recognise the Deputy's perspective.  He talked about the manner in which we do business.  The manner in which we do business is that we are the largest lender to the Irish economy.  We have been for the past ten years.  We have a 1.7 million customer base.  We are the largest lender, with more than 50% of the market share, to Irish small and medium enterprise, SMEs.  Last year, we had a 30% reduction in complaints about, for example, current accounts, which is the manner in which many customers will engage with us.  We were seeing the highest level on the net promoter score, which is an industry way of measuring satisfaction.  We have also fundamentally changed the culture of our colleagues, going from a very low level to leading global financial services benchmarks in terms of our colleagues' engagement and the cultural embedding.  The manner in which we run our bank is as a competitive entity and we take great pride in how we support our customers, colleagues and communities.<\/p> <p>  In response to the mortgage pricing, we often see comparisons with other banks in Europe that would offer, say, a 1% mortgage.  The Deputy will see that our rates would vary.  They are fixed rates.  In terms of the latest on our pricing, we would see a green mortgage, for example, being approximately 2.6%; Mr. Kelly can confirm that.  I would make a few comparisons here.  One is that many other bank markets like the UK have an application fee which is not included in the interest rate but is an effective charge.  We do not have application fees here.  It would not be unusual to see fees of &pound;999 or &pound;2,000 for a fixed rate long-term mortgage so that comparison does not exist.<\/p><p>Another key element to the Deputy's point is around the capital requirement.  In Ireland, the risk ratings attached to Irish mortgages for 2020 was circa 30%.  That would compare to a market like the UK, which is at 10%, or Portugal and Italy, which are at approximately 17% and 20% respectively.  The more capital that is associated with a loan, the more expensive it is to basically provide that finance.

We did not apply for subsidies or request any Government or State support for colleagues who are full-time employees of Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's first question, again, it is worthy of a broader debate.  I cannot talk about Ulster Bank.  Questions about Ulster Bank should be directed to it or NatWest.  We have, over the years, seen smaller banks enter and then exit the market, although in some cases, they were here for a long time.  It goes back to the point about being a small bank in a relatively small market such as Ireland.  It is difficult with the investment in technology and branch network, fixed costs related to regulatory compliance and the cost of doing business, particularly in a low-interest rate environment with muted credit formation.  It is difficult to meet minimum hurdle rates that shareholders expect.  We would, therefore, see the cost of capital and expectation for investors as being approximately 10%.  Our return on equity target was approximately 10%.  That has been incredibly difficult in a low-interest rate environment and we were loss-making for the first half of last year.  Banks not being able to achieve returns over a sustained period is not a good deployment of shareholder capital.  That is the challenge.<\/p> <p>  Ireland as a place to do business is very attractive.  A significant part of our economy relates to foreign direct investment, FDI.  We bank two out of every three FDIs that come into Ireland.  We will talk about the level of education and, obviously, the language benefit as a native English speaking country following Brexit as a differentiating factor, the relative youth of the population etc.  We see a huge number of FinTech, pharmaceutical and financial services companies coming into Ireland.  Ireland Inc. is, therefore, very compelling.  It is one of the only economies in the world globally last year that actually grew despite the pandemic because of those international companies.<\/p> <p>  On banking specifically, the European banking model is challenged.  That does not mean it is not possible to grow and support the economy, which is what we are endeavouring to do.  We have invested in digital platforms.  We want to grow as the country recovers.  We would have grown our lending book for the last three years until we got into the pandemic.  Brexit is in the rear-view mirror.  There was increasing optimism around Irish businesses and households about recovery.  We have a 15% increase in deposits because some people whose income has not been so impacted have been obliged to save as there is no opportunity to spend money.  Some parts of the economy, therefore, will be looking to have an increase in consumption.  Some people will use that for deposits for houses. <\/p> <p>  There is, therefore, cause to be optimistic but the dynamic is not a pot of gold.  It is a challenging environment and that is reflected in our financials.  The opportunities are also reflected in my cautious optimism about the future, however.  I believe the relationship between the State and the sector needs to be revisited and normalised.  I appreciate the past but our focus is firmly on supporting the future of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I am curious as to why Bank of Ireland did not seek to draw the TWSS when it had a loss of &euro;374 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#J01800","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":765,"content":"<p>To be honest, Irish banks seeking additional State support has not been our focus.

We are responding to a change in consumer behaviour.  Let us park banking for a moment.  The way people consume media, newspapers and food ordering has shifted.  I have no doubt even the Deputy may be purchasing some items online.  Banking is not immune to that.  Even though we may enjoy going shopping not everyone necessarily enjoys going into a branch.  If customers can find a more convenient instant way, for example, to apply for a loan, they will do so.  We are the leading provider to the agricultural sector.  Some 80% of our loans in the agricultural sector are done outside of branches.  We bank 40,000 farmers.  When we speak to farmers we hear they would prefer one of our mobile advisers to visit them within the restrictions that would be allowed, and this would have been pre-Covid.  They would rather do their business online or by telephone so that they can spend their day running their farm.

The reason I am asking about this, and I would be interested to get Ms McDonagh&rsquo;s comments on it, is that if these preferences continue, to follow her logic it inevitably must mean that a branch network for banking in Bank of Ireland in Ireland in the future is very much under threat.

Some of those embarking on a mortgage advisory journey for first-time buyers will prefer to come into a branch.  Also, some customers when dealing with insurance, seeking wealth advice, dealing with life events such as a bereavement, making a complaint or making certain transactions would rather come into a branch.

That is the reason, as Ms McDonagh said, we made a move a few years ago to move all our advisers out and about to meet customers and train them up in specific areas of expertise such as agri-advisers or other business or mortgage advisers.  For example, our agri-advisers spend quite a bit of time on farms advising customers.  I can give the Deputy a specific example of the way behaviours are changing and how we can support our customers.  I met a customer at the National Ploughing Championships a few years ago who wanted to make a branch appointment for a loan application.  I was able to put him in touch with our contact centre in Kilkenny where he was able to apply for the loan and by the time he got back home from the National Ploughing Championships in Offaly he had the money in his account.  That is what is happening.  Some 80% of applications are being made over the phone or over the Internet.  We have developed a skills set and expertise in Kilkenny and in Dublin where we have our contact centres.  Our staff in those centres are dealing with multiple applications day in, day out and become deep experts on lending applications for certain sectors.  That is then augmented by support on the ground.  We are out in communities.  We still have business and other advisers who meet customers at their premises.  Most of the meetings that happen face to face, which is the minority of our meetings, take place on business premises.  We have what we believe is the right balance.  The key word as we move forward with these changes is \"balance\".  We have the balance between the local knowledge and the local boots on the ground, to use that phrase, supported by people based in contact centres with deeper expertise and good Internet applications and service.  We seek to get that balance right, although it is not always the case in that we might overdo it in one channel or the other.  We are striving to adapt to customers' needs and behaviours to get that balance between that local approach and the central support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his reply.

We are committing to maintaining the ATM in Kilkee for this reason.  With respect to Miltown Malbay, I am aware we will be closing the ATM in the branch.  To pick up the Deputy's point, there are alternative ATMs in Miltown Malbay in supermarkets.  To give a bit of perspective on what we are seeing happen with cash, so we believe it will be comfortable, customers will have access to an ATM during supermarket hours and they will also have access through post office opening hours.  They can also use their card's cashback facility.  As we know, the cashback facility has become incredibly popular but to take one step back from this, we have seen a 33% drop in cash over the past year.  We could say this is because of Covid but to go back to what Ms McDonagh said earlier, I believe it is a service in which we will see a permanent shift.  Keeping a bit of perspective on this, we have all become familiar with contactless transactions.  In 2017, Bank of Ireland cardholders used contactless cards 70 million times.  In 2020, this number was 170 million.  There were 100 million more card transactions using contactless payments in 2020.  We believe this is a permanent shift.  It is something that will stick.  Between contactless payments, the use of cashback on debit cards, the ATM facility in the local supermarket and the post office service, the people of Miltown Malbay will be catered for, although I accept we will not have an external ATM in Miltown Malbay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":810,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's questions on Davy, there has been a lot of media speculation about our reported interest.  I will not respond to media speculation.  It is speculative at this stage; we know the decision by the board of Davy to initiate a sales process.  That is starting and the announcement is days old.  More generically, we look on a regular basis at opportunities to acquire businesses if they would add commercially and strategically to the value of the Bank of Ireland franchise, and this is true for any institution whether in Ireland or beyond.  This is a fairly generic statement.  It is not appropriate for me to respond to what could happen to the existing shareholders of Davy.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about culture.  I cannot opine on the culture of an institution of which I am not part.  For our own culture, I made a priority with my team to transform the culture at Bank of Ireland.  We have made significant changes.  We still have more to do and this is an ongoing piece of work but we have gone from being significantly below global financial services benchmarks, for example for cultural embedding, to now being at or above these benchmarks.  I have already said that culture is not some sort of soft happy clappy motherhood and apple pie poster in a staff canteen, when we used to go to staff canteens.  It is commercial.  It is about ensuring the sustainability of a business model, customer loyalty, effective outcomes, regulatory compliance and, ultimately, a long-term sustainable profitable business.  I have said this in the context of Bank of Ireland.  I am a firm believer in the type of transformation we are undergoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":811,"content":"<p>On the culture I have one very quick question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L02000","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":812,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L02100","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L02200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":814,"content":"<p>The Deputy is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L02300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I apologise for my invisibility.  For some reason, my machine has not been operating properly.  I welcome our guests and thank them for their candour and for their replies to the various questions.  It has been quite informative.<\/p> <p>  Electronically-driven business is good and works very effectively and efficiently from the point of view of those who can operate it but there is a question of visibility.  This is something the bank will have to address throughout the country, in urban and rural areas.  I believe there is a necessity, in order to do business as a bank, to have a visible entity that people can identify with.<\/p> <p>  I fully acknowledge the activities of the banks' regional managers and its experts in the various fields of agribusiness and other businesses.  Over the past five to seven years, I have used them in connection with various constituents who ran into difficulties and I thank the bank for having this facility.<\/p> <p>  I have also put my following question to the Governor of the Central Bank.  As we move out of Covid there will be a surge or an attempt to revive the economy.  I hope it will be very successful and we expect that it will be.  Reference has already been made in the course of this debate to the fact that expert opinion is important.  Who are the experts in this business?  There will come before the bank a series of people who have been badly bashed by Covid, and the same people were bashed by the downturn in the economy with the financial collapse.  I have had experience of the bank's performance in this area but it is hugely important from here on in that those who assess the viability of a project, particularly when the restrictions are lifted, know what they are at and that it does not always revert back to one person or to one or two people making a decision that impacts on the lives of those who have been in the particular business over a long number of years.  These people have worked extremely hard.  They have worked at building up their businesses.  They have sweated blood and tears to keep them in place .  It has not always happened and it has not been their fault.  It was not necessarily the fault of the bank either.  The fact of the matter is that we have reached the position we are now in.  The bank's customers cannot take a further bashing.  All I ask is that the bank is sympathetic towards them and allows them to make their case on the basis of their judgment and history, and their ability to survive where many others did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L02400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his positive feedback, which Mr. Kelly and I will share with our colleagues.

That is very important for our customers and I do not foresee a branchless society in Ireland in the coming years.  <\/p> <p> We would be very mindful of supporting SMEs, particularly as we come out of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economy recovers.  Since the start I have joined my colleagues in conversations with SMEs and corporates.  We have spoken to the trade associations that have been most severely impacted, through no fault of their own; they have just not been able to trade.  We have a long track record in SME lending and have sector specialists who are not only bankers but also practitioners in sectors like healthcare, agrifood, retail and many others.  We will seek to support SMEs to come out of this, wherever possible.  Brexit has created a huge amount of uncertainty and underinvestment in Irish SMEs.  There are still non-tariff barriers that are impacting some elements of the supply chain but hopefully they are temporary in nature.  The Covid-19 impact has been immeasurable but we are committed to supporting growth and recovery as we, hopefully, come out of this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions for Ms McDonagh, the first of which is on post offices.  What type of analysis has the bank carried out on the benefit that will accrue to post offices arising from their dealings with the Bank of Ireland?  What will each post office gain from the partnership?  It has been suggested to us that the partnership will yield very little in fees to the post offices and will not make a difference in terms of whether the business closes or remains open.  What happens when a post office with which the bank has a contract closes?  Has the bank discussed that scenario with the post offices?  The branches that have been identified to be closed by the Bank of Ireland over time in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny include those in Callan, Graiguenamanagh, Urlingford, Thomastown, Borris and Tullow.  In each of those locations, there is a busy local economy strongly supported by the agriculture sector but at least one of the post offices has already been affected in terms of its viability.  In our discussions with representatives of the post office network at a national level, we referred to post offices that would have struggled at the best of times and which have been challenged.  What analysis has the bank carried out in each of those areas and what is the comparison?<\/p> <p>  The other issue in these areas is the availability of broadband.  Again, in the county towns that are mentioned in Carlow and Kilkenny, the availability of broadband is bad and delivery is not likely to happen for quite some time.  Even then, it may not be the fibre optic broadband used in more densely populated areas.  What is the future for these post offices?  Ms McDonagh has talked it up but at the end of the day, the partnership may be worth &euro;1,000 to some individual post offices in fees but in essence, it will not make much of a difference.  The bank is using this partnership to talk up the future of post offices.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of repossessions.  How many decisions on repossession does the bank have right now?  How many decisions on the repossession of family homes or similar properties are in the pipeline?  Is Bank of Ireland expressing an interest in the Ulster Bank loan book?  I am interested in the Davy issue from the point of view of the salary levels for higher executives that have been mentioned.  On the one hand, we are talking about the difficulties in Irish banks arising from the crash and the interest rates that are being paid but on the other hand, we have enormous salaries being paid to higher executives.  The two issues are not matching; there is room for salary increases but no room for interest rate decreases.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of negotiations with customers who are in difficulty, I have a question that could be posed to every bank and not just Bank of Ireland.  Where the bank is negotiating on the debt of a family, individual or business and there is a death by suicide, how does the bank separate that out and deal with in a more sympathetic and sensitive way?  Has the bank learned lessons in terms of how to deal with people in trouble in the context of getting them over the line with a better arrangement?  What has been the bank's experience in this regard?  <\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the matter of internal investigations.  First, I thank Bank of Ireland for the engagement I have had with senior executives.  While the engagement may not bear fruit, it has been positive in terms of the experience and understanding given to the customer from it.  In one or two of the engagements in which I was involved, an internal investigation was under way.  The external view on the debt was that it was affected by the tracker issue but the internal view was that it was not, very definitely.  The two views were completely at odds with each other and while the financial services ombudsman service exists and issues can be referred on, I was surprised that the bank does not use an outside resource in the context of an examination of issues that arise between the bank and the customer or an understanding of the questions that are being asked of the bank.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#M00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his questions.

A lot of consideration was given to the coverage of the post offices across each county before reaching a decision.  In Carlow-Kilkenny, for example, there are 34 post offices between the two counties.  Our negotiations so far have been directly with An Post and we would not be privy to the onward negotiations between An Post and the local postmasters.<\/p> <p>  As we said earlier, scale is important.  We are not the first bank to use the post office but building up the scale and volume of transactions will make a significant difference to customers and to postmasters in terms of viability going forward.<\/p><p>The more services we can put into the post offices, the better.  I believe we are helping and contributing towards that.  Any other questions on that would need to be directed at the post office.<\/p><p> On the specific locations, in the south east we looked at counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford together.  There was a strong affinity between the Graiguenamanagh branch and the sub-office in New Ross in the past.  While there is a lot of rivalry on the hurling pitch between Kilkenny and Wexford, from an economic and banking perspective, we certainly see a lot of work and co-operation from the local economies as they support each other.  That is the way we will run our business to give support to customers, as the Chairman said, in thriving counties.  We believe we have adequate coverage across those four counties to ensure we support our customers as we move forward.<\/p><p> Kilkenny is a very important county to us.

We have made a significant investment in our mobile banking app, with a 50% increase in functionality.  The app can be accessed without broadband through mobile networks, which have a different level of coverage.<\/p> <p>  I will now address the broader question of repossession and dealing with and supporting customers who have experienced loss, including death by suicide.  For the past 12 months, we have paused all repossession orders.  I do not have information to hand on historical or future numbers.  We can revert offline in writing.  We have not executed, implemented or progressed any repossession orders for the last 12 months, given the external environment and the challenges faced by customers during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  On supporting customers in financial distress, we have a long track record as having the lowest level of non-performing exposures, especially of retail customers, within the industry.  I will give the committee a perspective in terms of scale.  For owner-occupier mortgages that are more than 90 days past due, Bank of Ireland has only 1.9% of customers in that situation, while the figure for the industry is above 6%.  The Bank of Ireland figure is a fraction of the industry average.  We are a big part of that industry and the average figure includes us.  For buy-to-let mortgages, we have 4% of customers who are 90 days past due.  The industry average for that sector is 16%.<\/p> <p>  We are in a far stronger position with regard to the quality of our portfolio and in the quality of engagement support we provide our customers.  We engage with the customer and in nine out of ten scenarios we find a solution that is sustainable for and accepted by the customer.  For the customers who are personally impacted and vulnerable, whether it is a circumstantial vulnerability due to bereavement, illness or other challenges, we have established a specialist vulnerable customer unit for all customers, whether they are in financial distress or not.  The unit received 4,500 calls during 2020.  We have a specialist team in our credit loan support, who are among our most experienced and specialist advisers, to support customers who have greater level of vulnerability or who have suffered a loss.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ulster Bank, we take all opportunities to look at portfolios and acquisitions.  Among the Irish banks, Bank of Ireland has done the most portfolio acquisitions in recent history.  We did eight acquisitions of portfolios in the past five years.  We are not being quoted as currently engaged with Ulster Bank.  We focus on opportunities that add strategic and commercial value for our full stakeholder range. I hope this answers the Chairman's question.<\/p> <p>  I believe I answered the question on remuneration and Davy.  While not referring to Davy specifically, if we were to acquire an entity that had normalised pay, we would seek permission, as part of the current requirement under the stakeholder engagement relationship we have with the Department of Finance, for us to maintain the existing remuneration arrangements in an entity if we were to acquire it.  That is a generic response to the Chairman's question.<\/p> <p>  I have presented to this committee many times specifically on tracker mortgages.  I made it a personal commitment to address the issue.  We have a 99.8% contact and remediation rate with customers.  In total, there are only 37 customers who we continue to trace.  There were 800 customers before but we have successfully traced them.  We have put a significant amount of effort and resources into this.  We use an independent panel, which is a requirement of the tracker mortgage examination.  These are senior, independent people who review any customer appeal if customers feel they have not secured an outcome from the bank that they feel is fair.  If a customer makes an appeal, it goes directly to that independent panel.  The customer also has the choice to go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which will review all complaints.  We try to work with all customers and the numbers reflect our commitment to address the tracker issue.

We appreciate the chance to follow up on our previous meeting.  We submitted a follow-up written response after that meeting and we hope that members found it helpful.  Today is an opportunity for us to talk through some of those responses and we would be happy to answer questions on those or related matters.<\/p> <p>  I will start by noting what members will have noted, that being, since our previous engagement with the committee, there have been further notable interventions in the discussion.  In fact, it seems that not a week goes by without another major intervention in this debate.  Members will be aware of last night's \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme on RT&Eacute; and the paper being launched today by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  There will be a shared island unit event this week and Ireland's Future is holding a major report launch on Thursday.  We have also seen further proposals emerge around a timeframe and even a suggested date for when it might happen.  In a sense, all of this underlines what we suggested at the previous meeting, that being, the momentum around this debate is remarkable.  However, it raises the question of where the debate will go next.<\/p> <p>  I will address two of the questions covered in our written response and my colleague, Mr. Bassett, will focus on the other two.  We hope that our written response will be made publicly available so that members of the public can read what we have written.<\/p> <p>  The first question we have addressed is that of how long the Northern Ireland institutions could or should continue after Irish reunification.  The Good Friday Agreement contemplates a transfer of sovereignty from the UK to Ireland, but it does not expressly address the precise form that a united Ireland would take.  The agreement and its values will shape that discussion alongside other existing obligations relating to continuity of protection.  There are clear provisions in the Good Friday Agreement that are forward facing and the committee is well aware of concerning rigorous impartiality and guarantees around identity, culture, citizenship and rights.  There should be no diminution of guarantees and protections as a consequence of a vote for a united Ireland.  There must be an equivalent level of protection in terms of guarantees, protections and rights in the event of a united Ireland.<\/p><p>We recognise the significance of shared institutions in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland as one part of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those Northern Ireland institutions will remain in place unless and until an alternative arrangement is agreed.  We believe this is part of a larger, constitutional conversation that, as committee members know, is ongoing and intensifying at the moment, around the precise form a united Ireland will take with detailed questions around constitutional design.  For example, there are proposals at the moment for a citizens' assembly to focus on some of these and related questions.  That might be a helpful channel for this debate going forward.  Whatever happens in terms of the Northern legislature, executive and judiciary, the approach will need to be consistent with current constitutional arrangements in Ireland or any new constitution that emerges, as well as other relevant legal obligations.  We highlight the sense that this is part of an ongoing, larger conversation about constitutional design.  <\/p><p> Why focus on securing referendums when important work on reconciliation remains outstanding?  We are aware that this question often comes up and we felt it would be helpful to further clarify our response.  In our view, the work on reconciliation is absolutely essential.  The work is ongoing, and it must continue whatever the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  We take that as a basic starting point.  However, our view is that reconciliation, and debates around reconciliation and a shared future, are simply not assisted or advanced by avoiding hard questions about the constitutional future.  In other words, we do not help the cause of reconciliation by avoiding doing the necessary homework in advance of these referendums taking place. <\/p><p> We also do not think the current debate is assisted by making reconciliation a precondition to holding the referendums contemplated in the agreement.  In our view, this is not an either-or conversation.  The work of reconciliation will continue alongside the referendums anticipated in the agreement.  Arguably, in our view, making this an obstacle to progress breaches the express terms of the agreement, as does the recently mooted notion that these referendums can be categorically ruled out for an indefinite or set period of time.  That sort of language runs very close to being out of step with the express terms of the agreement.  <\/p><p> Echoing what we said in our first engagement, and welcoming the chance to follow up today, our strong advice to this committee is against reopening the express terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Instead, our advice today, as in our first engagement, is that the collective focus must be on the good faith implementation of existing commitments and good faith adherence to the textual requirements of the agreement.<\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. Mark Bassett, will address the other questions in our follow-up response.  I thank the committee and look forward to the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to come here again to speak.  One of the questions asked on the last occasion, which I did not get a chance to address in full, was what was meant by external impediment in the Good Friday Agreement.  In our written response, we said that at the core of the Good Friday Agreement and the constitutional arrangements in the UK and Ireland, is that Irish reunification is a question for the people of Ireland.  It requires a vote in support in each jurisdiction but there should be no external or outside impediment.  The report looked at the position of Irish membership of the European Union and came to the clear conclusion that membership of the European Union was not going to be an obstacle, nor was membership of the eurozone.  I always thought that the phrase external impediment typically referred to the Westminster Parliament.  It would not be open to a future British Parliament to disregard referendum votes in both the North and the South.<\/p> <p>  If one thinks back to previous Irish electorates voting for repeal, Home Rule or an Irish republic, it was dependent on winning support in the Westminster Parliament.  We say that is no longer the case.  There is still a very strong, traditional understanding of the sovereignty or supremacy of the Westminster Parliament in that it can legislate as it sees fit.  Any restrictions on that choice are self-imposed.  Examples are sometimes given that Westminster could legislate to prohibit smoking in Paris or to revoke the independence of colonies.  We say that the reference to \"without external impediment\" is a recognition by the UK that it would not be practical or realistic for a future UK Parliament to frustrate those votes.  <\/p> <p>  The other question we addressed in the subsequent written piece was whether or not it has to be a binary question when the referendums are posed in both the North and South.  Does it have to be either Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom or a reunified Ireland?  We say it is pretty clear in the Good Friday Agreement that this is the choice.  It is a binary choice.  Re-partition, independence, the accession of Northern Ireland to another state or indefinite joint authority between Britain and Ireland is not contemplated in the agreement.  If that was proposed, it would require a back to basics approach to the agreement and we think that would be an unwise move.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement has formidable democratic authority.  It was endorsed in referendums both North and South.  It has formidable legal and political backing.  There is bipartisan backing for it in the United States Congress.  It is a feature of the Irish Constitution and the UK's constitutional arrangements.  It is in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement and is a matter of EU law as well as the mechanism for self-determination and reunification.  We say that a referendum will be posed in those terms.  It will be a choice for Northern Ireland whether it wishes to join a united Ireland, which is a member of the European Union, or remain as part of the United Kingdom in the Northern Ireland protocol.  That is how we anticipate the vote will be formed.<\/p> <p>  That is enough from my opening statement, covering what we had written.  As Professor Harvey said, I look forward to continuing the discussion and answering any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":847,"content":"<p>We have roughly two hours for a debate.

I did not get an opportunity to put a question the last day, so I appreciate the opportunity now to speak in this second round.<\/p><p>It is almost 23 years since the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people in both jurisdictions on this island.  That is more than a generation ago and much has changed.  Reference has been made to the impact of Brexit, but the political landscape in the North has also changed significantly over that generation.  Twenty three years is a considerable amount of time for dialogue and discussion.  The Good Friday Agreement gave nationalists and republicans the right to democratically and peacefully pursue their objective of a united Ireland.  That is what one does in a democracy.  It is up to anybody in a democracy to win hearts and minds for their perspective, arguments and propositions.<\/p><p>Senator Currie referred to last night's debate.  One point that occurs to me is that all of the political voices who argued that they are in favour of a united Ireland or argued that they are republicans stated that we need to prepare the ground for a referendum.  We need to do this properly and that is exactly what is stated in this paper.  At the first meeting with Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett their presentation stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn our view the people of this island are likely to be offered a choice about their constitutional future in the decade ahead.  It is essential that when that time comes everyone is clear about the consequences. <\/blockquote> <p>Their paper argues that we should prepare the ground constitutionally.  In last night's debate I did not hear anybody disagree with that politically but what is missing from this debate is what form that preparation takes.  Is it endless talking shops or is there a structure to the preparation?  For example, is it agreed that we have a Citizens' Assembly?  I note with interest the speech given by Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputy Jim O'Callaghan to the University of Sussex in which he put forward some propositions, for example, that one House of Parliament would sit in Belfast and that there would be regional policing arrangements.  He is putting out some ideas about the form a new Ireland would take.  Today, another Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, James O'Connor, argued that the three coalition parties should put in place a Minister of State with responsibility for Irish unity.  There is a growing realisation politically that we need to responsibly prepare the ground for Irish unity.  I accept that involves dialogue and discussion.  I call on both Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett to spell out the structures and processes that take us forward.  Everybody agrees that in due course a referendum is inevitable, whether in five years, ten years or other period.  There is political acceptance that it is inevitable.  Therefore, it is very responsible to prepare properly.  What is the process?  Is it by means of a Citizens' Assembly, a White Paper on Irish unity or an all-Ireland Oireachtas committee on Irish unity?  Could the witnesses spell out in clear terms what they believe are the ways forward?<\/p><p>I accept there are different perspectives in our committee and the witnesses would have seen that at their first meeting.  I invite those who challenged the paper at the previous meeting, who say they are in favour of Irish unity, to comment.  In politics, as with everything in life, whether one is a manager of a football team or running a business, if one says one wants to make something happen one has to have a plan to make it happen.  I ask those who challenge the paper to say what is their plan for moving towards Irish unity.  How do they intend to advance the cause of Irish unity?  Who are they making their case to and in what format?  In what timeline should it take place?  With all due respect, I put that challenge to all those who say they want to see Irish unity.  I would like to hear a dialogue.  This is a great opportunity.  I accept there is a lot more to come.  I hope that the MP, Ian Paisley Jnr., will join us soon to discuss some of his thoughts on all of this.  He certainly indicated recently that he would.  We want to hear more voices, but today is about hearing from Professor Harvey, and Mr. Bassett who is a barrister, as they speak in their professional capacities about their paper and what they think we should do.  I invite other participants to give us their thoughts.  This is a really important dialogue, as was last night's debate.  They are my questions and that is all I have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D00700","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Do we have any other Sinn F&eacute;in speaker before I call on the witnesses to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D00800","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Could I get the answers first as other speakers got their answers following their rounds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D00900","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":870,"content":"<p>That is not a problem.

The Irish Constitution will have to give proper regard to the principle of parity of esteem in its law and we have said that should also extend to EU law.  One of the points is that there will be many residents and citizens of the new united Ireland who will be British citizens.  That status will be based on British nationality legislation but it will continue in perpetuity and it needs to be respected in the new united Ireland.  There are a number of aspects of Irish electoral law in particular, which at the moment are based on Irish citizenship, so a helpful exercise at this point would be to identify what aspects of the Irish Constitution or Irish legislation are potentially in conflict with the duty of parity of esteem with the nation state exercising sovereignty in the North.<\/p><p> Other suggestions are made such as that work could be undertaken within the European institutions.  Consideration will have to be given to rights of participation in the European Parliament for an enlarged state or in the Council also.<\/p><p> Another useful exercise would be identifying how the Northern institutions - the Executive, the Assembly and the Northern legal system - will be accommodated, at least initially, and unless and until something else is agreed under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  A useful audit would be to identify if there is a potential conflict between any of the Constitution's provisions and executive, legislative or judicial power and to get ready to show that it is manageable under the current Constitution subject to amendments, which give effect to unification, and, importantly, give effect to the duties and responsibilities that Ireland will assume in a united Ireland.<\/p><p> The other aspect that could be considered is how the other east-west relationships will be accommodated in a new united Ireland.  We believe for the most part that the provisions are operable in a united Ireland, but it would be helpful at this stage if work was undertaken within Departments in the Republic of Ireland to show exactly how that can be managed.<\/p><p> In terms of a citizens' assembly, it is suggested as being helpful within the report.  It would be hoped that would build on the success of previous constitutional conventions and citizens' assemblies, draw in a membership from across the island, and make suggestions that would be part of any consultation process in advance of the referendums on unity.<\/p><p> The other point which is very important is that the preparatory work on the actual choice that will be presented to the electorate in the North and in the South should begin now.  Some thought should be given to the wording or how reunification can be achieved under the Irish Constitution.  Also, thought should be given to how the wording of the question will be posed in the North.  We do not want a situation where we end up with incompatible results or two legal or constitutional systems which are shouting at each other, so to speak, with contradictory results.  There needs to be co-ordination between the Irish and British Governments on how these concurrent referendums will take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I want to say first that my opinions in respect of the report are personal.  Coming from a very republican background, I, as much as anyone in this line, want to see unity of our people and our country, but I am also conscious of how where we have got to was achieved.  With all due respect to the two witnesses, how it was achieved has been missed with regard to their report.  For me, it does not give enough recognition to the background work that was done with regard to the coming together of the Good Friday Agreement.  Incidentally, the Good Friday Agreement was never done with a time limit over anybody's head.  It was a culmination of years of work that allowed us, in the end, to enter a room and get an agreement.  If truth be known, it goes back to the 1990s.  If the question of Irish unity was that easily settled, it could have been done with the Good Friday Agreement, so let us not cod ourselves.  This is not something that will be easily achieved, but the one thing the Good Friday Agreement did have was respect for opinion and an assurance that everyone around the table had their say.<\/p> <p>  I was taken aback somewhat by the language used in the report and by the witnesses reporting on it.  I believe they are predetermining the outcome of the poll with the continual talk of a united Ireland.  Last night, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald spoke about not putting the cart before the horse.  We all need to step back a little bit.  This is not an effort to attack anybody at this meeting because that is not useful, but we need to be honest about how we approach this issue.  I asked the witnesses several times on the previous day if they had engaged with unionism in terms of communities or political parties and they failed to answer that question.  They danced around it, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  At the outset the witnesses said they had EU oversight.  What EU oversight do they have?  I do not believe they have any EU oversight.  Their funding was got as a result of a couple of MEPs pulling funds together.<\/p> <p>  I believe their report is of a strong nationalist view.  That is grand but I believe we need to start getting a view from the other side.  I hope they take these comments from the perspective of me being helpful.  For their report to have better grounding and an understanding all round, they will have to start engaging with unionist communities and politicians because its opinion is too much on one side.  It is not grounded on enough academia.  There is too much personal opinion in it.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to knock all of the report.  Some of it is represents a useful start but I do not believe the witnesses' report is complete.  I think they could take it further and I would encourage them to do that and make an effort to start engaging with unionism because we need to come at this from a whole-of-picture perspective.<\/p> <p>  As far as preparing the ground is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not complete in all its entity.  That is the first bit of work we need to do because if we do not do that, we do not have everybody around the table.  This committee we sit on is not complete because everybody is not around the table.  If we have learned one thing over the past decades it is that coerciveness does not work.  We need to be inclusive and bring everybody on board.  People like the witnesses are critical with regard to that.<\/p> <p>  This could be a good report but there is some work still to be done.  That is my point of view.<\/p><p>Some may be critical of it but there will not be an agreement down the road unless we are more inclusive and show the hand of friendship.  Unless we show that we are all willing to share this island together, there will not be a happy conclusion to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#E00500","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I welcome the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme and all contributions to the debate.  I hope it is clear that what we have been stressing today is a need for a wide, deep and inclusive conversation, along with preparation and planning in advance.  Nobody wants a referendum tomorrow or next week.  People want to be ready and that is the spirit of what we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  We have emphasised very much in our work that one must stick to the Good Friday Agreement and its terms.  Again, I urge the committee to revisit the relevant provisions in the agreement around this.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our suggestions, we have talked about a Citizens' Assembly.  We have underlined in our work that we need wide, deep and inclusive citizen engagement.  The idea of an all-island Citizens' Assembly is a great one.  The proposal for a joint Oireachtas committee and a Minister is also welcome.  A White Paper from the Irish Government would be incredibly helpful.  Both Governments setting out the parameters of the process would be very helpful.  I would be anxious about leaving this entirely to the Secretary of State.  Both Governments engaging in advance would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, we are talking about preparing and planning in advance for a proposition.  If a political party claims to be supportive of this constitutional objective, what will its representatives say on people's doorsteps - if we are allowed to do so at some stage - about its proposals?  Ultimately, we are urging the committee to do the preparatory work in order that we have something coherent and credible to say about what the propositions of the Irish State, the Irish Government and those advocating change will actually be when these referendums happen within the next decade.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the feedback on the report and we will take Senator Blaney's comments on board.  I highlighted earlier that our report is one part of a larger body of work that we have been doing.  We have supplied the committee with some of that larger body of work.  We will happily follow up on that.  That report is very much focused on the role of the European Union.  We stressed in that report and in other work the need to plan and prepare in advance.  We are aware this is not easy.  However, I started the presentation with paying close attention to the nature of the current conversation.  The level of engagement that is actually happening is striking.  There is a risk that we fail to notice, for example, the level of civic unionist engagement in the current conversation and the level of engagement among those who find some of the old traditional labels deeply uncomfortable but want to have a sensible discussion about the constitutional future.  There is actually civic unionist engagement, as well as engagement in this conversation by people who want to move beyond the old labels.  We need to pay attention to that.<\/p> <p>  We very much see ourselves as part of that.  In my academic capacity, I felt that what we have been doing is laying the groundwork on some of the more challenging legal questions.  Other work that I have been doing in civil society is very much about engaging with civic unionism and with all elements of society.  For example, a recent event held by Ireland's Future included engagement in the conversation from people from a unionist background.  We should not underestimate or undervalue - it would be almost disrespecting it - the extent to which people are already involved in this process.<\/p> <p>  We use the language in the report and on the cover of planning and preparing for constitutional change.  We have underlined in our work that the responsible and sensible thing to do is to manage and plan all this.  In a sense, we very much agree with the committee that this should be an inclusive, broad and deep conversation.  It benefits no one on the island, however, if we run away, hide from or use a variety of techniques to deflect from doing the hard work now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I apologise as I am in transit to an appointment.  I could not get changed so I am going to keep my camera off.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I do not have a large number of questions because I squeezed a lot in the last time.  On the discussion of dates, I do not think we are ready.  For the past several decades, our material well-being and day-to-day outcomes in Northern Ireland, let alone the project of reconciliation, are often overlooked and overshadowed by focus on the constitutional issues from both perspectives.  There is a kind of a jam tomorrow conversation generally.  That is not in any way denying or thwarting the conversation that is definitely under way.  It is just a comment on all the stuff that requires to be done, regardless of constitutional outlook, as well as the day-to-day stuff one has to get through as an elected representative.<\/p> <p>  Professor Harvey suggested May 2023 for a referendum.  Does he think that is achievable?  On the comment about the continuity, or otherwise, of the Northern institutions, it has been the position of both the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in that they would continue.  Richard Humphrey's legal opinion is that there is no sunset clause on them.  Does Professor Harvey see merit in them continuing, both in terms of a kind of a forum through which to manage ongoing issues around equality and so on in the North and to facilitate some of the protections currently there for nationalists?  The outcome of a border poll, one way or the other, does not solve all of our problems.<\/p> <p>  Does Professor Harvey see any potential in following other forms of devolution that might be prompted by having a Northern Assembly, whether that is opportunities for the north west and Donegal to participate in that?  Does he see devolution being a regional parliament for Cork?  Does he see basically the presence of a Northern Assembly stimulating conversations about other forms of devolution of power, such as an enhancement of the role of county councils?  I noted he said that they are not set in stone.  What vision does he have for them and what conversations might they promote more widely?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":881,"content":"<p>The continuation of the Northern institutions in the case of a united Ireland is an important aspect of the conversation and the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>The question of unity is a majoritarian one.  At the moment, 50% plus 1 is enough in the North for union with Great Britain.  It is a principle of democracy and equality of democracy that a comparable vote would be enough to ensure Irish unification.  Against that majoritarian principle there are a number of counter majoritarian principles in the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the most important of those is the shared institutions - power sharing in the Executive and assembly.  There is a duty of parity of esteem on the government exercising sovereignty and that has to be taken more seriously by the Irish State.  It probably has been taken seriously by the British State since 1998.<\/p><p> In the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme last night, there were discussions about what should happen to the title of Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and what should happen to the flag and symbols.  The state in the North is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The flag is the Union Jack.  There is no power sharing in London and a hereditary monarch is the head of state.  It is very important that the shared institutions continue but also that there is an audit of those aspects of the Irish State that could be objectionable and can be amended to ensure that power is seen and the equal protection of rights is given effect.<\/p><p> In terms of the idea of regional parliaments within the State, I have not detected an appetite for that in any of the legal or constitutional research that I have done.  I will defer to the members of the panel who would know much more about that than I do.  <\/p><p> Senator Blaney asked about engagement with unionist politicians.  To explain, this report is a legal report.  What we tried to do is identify the relevant applicable legal rules, whether they exist in public international law, EU law, UK law or Irish constitutional law.  We have tried to explain how they are going to apply in the case of a united Ireland.  That is the purpose of the report.  Some of the conclusions are very clear and some of them are contestable but we have tried to set out reasonable suggestions.  This report is one of a series that was commissioned by MEPs, one of which looked at the protection of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in Northern Ireland after Brexit.  Another one looked at the possibility of a special designated status for Northern Ireland in EU law.  This report tried to follow that template in identifying the relevant law and explaining how it might apply in these circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>  I thank members for their questions.  I will follow on from what Mr. Bassett has said.  A few of the questions were directed towards the idea of dates so maybe I should say something about those.  The spirit in which we have conducted this work is that these referendums are likely to happen, maybe sooner than people anticipate.  In 2019, I made a suggestion around a possible date.  The suggestion was born out of a sense of frustration, which I suspect many members of the committee share.  I had been to one too many meetings where people stood up and said there needed to be planning and preparation but then everybody went home and did nothing.  My view is that very little planning, project planning or homework would get done on the island of Ireland if the date was completely open-ended.  My view, therefore, is that a timeframe is helpful to focus minds to get the work done.  Again, I am not sure how much homework would get done on this island if there was no timeframe for the discussion.<\/p> <p>  It is notable that Bertie Ahern has followed my lead in suggesting the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  I had suggested the 25th anniversary.  We notice there is a convergence in the debate around the next decade.  Their seems to be an emerging sense that we are in a crucial decade for the constitutional conversation.  As members know, Brexit has dramatically affected that debate.  To emphasise and echo what Mr. Bassett has said, our contribution is to encourage and make sure people do the relevant planning.<\/p> <p>  On the Northern institutions, we have made clear that the guarantees and assurances continue unless and until alternative arrangements are achieved.  We appreciate, as we acknowledge in our report, that there is discussion on a new constitution and new architecture.  That is why we think there needs to be extensive civic engagement in preparing for that.<\/p> <p>  On the 50% plus 1 argument, to echo something Mr. Bassett said, we are a bit concerned that people are ignoring or neglecting the assurances, guarantees and protections that are already in the Good Friday Agreement around mutual respect, parity of esteem, equality of treatment and equality in rights.  They will map forward on to the arrangements that we are talking, or they should map forward, and that is why we have talked about the sort of audit we described today.  Rather than focus on the 50% plus 1 conversation - in our view it is 50% plus 1 - we need to spend more time thinking about the guarantees, protections and assurances that will reassure people and provide security, and that are there, in relation to carrying forward the values of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The devolution conversation - the conversation around the Northern institutions - is profoundly helpful because, in my view, the Irish State is over-centralised.  One of the great positives about this discussion is that it will encourage a wider discussion in Ireland around regional policy.  Many regions on this island have been fundamentally failed, Donegal, for example, through the excessive over-centralisation of the existing State.  If this conversation encourages a wider, deeper and more inclusive discussion about the over-centralisation of the current Irish State, that would be very welcome for people in the north west, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Stephen Farry, Alliance Party MP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#G00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I will make a few observations to which Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett are happy to respond.  I stress again that I come at this issue as a non-nationalist but someone who is open to debates.  I am engaging in discussions on a speculative basis and without prejudice to whatever view we may or may not take down the line as events and developments unfold.<\/p> <p>  I caution very strongly against setting artificial timeframes for when a border poll may or may not occur.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that this is a condition-led rather than date-led process.  We are not at that stage yet but I fully accept that this is a fluid situation and that this may become apparent over the coming years.  That could happen quickly or it could be further off in the distance.  Again, we need to be open-minded in that respect.<\/p> <p>  There are two parallel discussions.  They are interrelated but perhaps they need to move at slightly different paces.  I respect that Professor Harvey is frustrated that there is not yet sufficient clarity on the precise thresholds for decision-making around invoking a border poll.  I make very clear that I fully accept the rules that were set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  I also recognise that they leave some further questions unanswered so I respect that there is a desire to get fuller clarification in that respect.<\/p><p>At this stage, I would place far more emphasis on discussing what a potential united Ireland would look like.  From my discussions with people in Northern Ireland, that is probably the more relevant and active debate at this stage rather than the mechanics of it.  That is probably where the most focus needs to be placed in the immediate future.<\/p><p> There are three different elements that one would, in theory, walk through in trying to advance that debate.  The first is about what loose or fragmented discussions are currently happening.  I appreciate that some are frustrated they are not moving on to more structured discussions more quickly, but I do not necessarily share that frustration.  This debate is still fairly embryonic, and the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme from last night reinforces that point.<\/p><p> Much more can be done to try to crystalise the arguments and engage with a broader range of voices.  Rather than simply having circular discussions, there is a challenge for civic society organisations, and our universities and colleges in particular, to convene more forums to work through some of those issues and talk about some of the grander details, not just on identity issues but matters of public finances, for example, and what would happen with health policy and provision.<\/p><p> I can also see merit in holding some form of civic forum or citizens' assembly in due course, but I do not think we are at that point just yet.  There is a question as to who would convene and organise any citizens' assembly and how that assembly would be representative.  More work needs to be done before we are at the point of a citizens' assembly being convened.  There is a bigger question because if a question were ever to be put in a referendum, governments would need to be involved in that process.  Those three phases can obviously overlap with one another but they start at different points.  I do not think we are at the second or third points just yet but I acknowledge that, in terms of a logical process, they would be steps in that wider journey.<\/p><p> It is important to take into account the magnitude of what is being discussed here.  A territory changing from one sovereign state to another is pretty much unprecedented in modern times or even in the past century.  The German reunification is not a like-for-like comparison, given the particular context there.  The enormity of this is important to bear in mind and it is something to work through in a stage-by-stage process.<\/p><p> I have made this point previously but I will stress it again.  Notwithstanding the wider constitutional and political debates around this matter, there is still significant space for practical North-South co-operation to be taken forward on a range of economic, social, environmental and infrastructure issues.  That may be a precursor to something else or it might just stand on its own two feet, but that is something I would encourage a lot of focus to be placed on in the near term as well.  I am happy for either Professor Harvey or Mr. Bassett to respond to those reflections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I agree with the broad parameters of what Mr. Farry has said.  First, it is absolutely vital that we clarify the process parameters of the referendum.  Mr. Farry will know I have been writing to the Secretary of State to try to clarify that.  It would be very helpful indeed if we knew a bit more and there was more transparency around this process because, as he has rightly pointed out, core aspects of this are condition led so it would be nice to know more about the conditions.  Other questions are being clarified in Scotland at the moment around its referendum process, and we would like more details on that as well.<\/p> <p>  Second, I agree with the sense that we need to clarify the proposition.  Real work needs to be done on this island about what the proposition is for the new constitutional arrangements.  That is why there has been such a focus on a citizens' assembly as a way to try to move this debate on.  Mr. Farry highlighted the work of universities.  In the majority of universities on this island, somebody or other is doing a project or initiative relating to this question.  There is extensive citizen engagement, which is very noticeable in the North, not just from advocates for constitutional change but civic unionist voices who are beginning to coalesce around what is starting to look like a sort of informal referendum campaign.<\/p> <p>  There are two aspects to this.  One is the co-ordination of all that work.  There is a lot of work going on at the moment.  How is that being co-ordinated?  Does the shared island unit, for example, have a role in doing that?  Second, and I mentioned this earlier, if people are going to enter a referendum campaign, what are they going to say?  I agree that not enough work has been done on the side of those advocating constitutional change as to what precisely the parameters of that change are.  We have heard every suggestion in the discussion in the past while, from what is basically a continuity Good Friday Agreement to very radical constitutional change involving a new Constitution.  The question I would raise with the committee today as regards taking forward its work is, what exactly is the proposition going to be?  When people are campaigning in this referendum, what are they going to say?  If they have not got an answer to that question, they need to start thinking about how they are going to get an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":888,"content":"<p>We agreed a rotation earlier on, so we will go back to Sinn F&eacute;in, then-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I have had my hand up for a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H00400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I have had Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's name down for some time, but we agreed this rotation at the beginning of the meeting and Sinn F&eacute;in is next.

It is enormously important and I refute some of the comments that have been made about it.  There is real value in it because it raises key questions I have not seen raised anywhere else.  In any papers that are written there are observations and certain editorial stuff, but there is real factual stuff here, for instance, around who has the right to vote and other things.  There are also questions about engagement with others and so on.  I have yet to meet anybody who does not want to prepare or does not recognise the need for preparation.  This question keeps being raised all the time, as if there is a cohort of people who do not see a need to prepare.  We in my party see the need to prepare and understand what needs to be done, whether that be a constitutional assembly, a White Paper, an Oireachtas committee or a combination of all those things.  To move the conversation on, we need to take that question off the table.<\/p> <p>  I hear what the witnesses are saying about the responsibility of this committee regarding how we are going to carry this forward.  I am glad to have the opportunity to hear their input again today.  Arising from the discussion and recommendations the last time we met - the Chairman will confirm this - we agreed to write to the Secretary of State to ask him to bring some clarity to the matrix and the criteria he was going to use, just as Professor Harvey had written to him in December.  My first question relates to the follow-up letter he sent to the Secretary of State on 19 January.  Has he had any response to that letter?<\/p><p>I am interested in point No. 40 in the professor's paper that reunification should be presented as a vindication of the Constitution rather than an unacceptable risk to its stability.  Will Professor Harvey speak further to that?  Nobody has the monopoly on this, which Deputy McDonald made clear last night.Nobody owns the questions or the conversation around the constitutional future.  We will all have input.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the third-level sector, I was very interested some weeks ago to see an article by Fionn&aacute;n Uibh Eochach in the <i>University Times<\/i>on the role that universities and the third-level sector would play in all of this.  Does Professor Harvey have any suggestions around that?<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to other platforms.  There is a new online platform that hosts the debate around the constitutional future debate that was prepared by Professor Peter Shirlow from the University of Liverpool, and a group working with him.  Again, I believe this is really informed.  Nobody has a monopoly on the conversation.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps Professor Harvey could comment on the Secretary of State, on the vindication of the Constitution, and on the third-level sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H01000","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  I also thank the Senator for following up by writing to the Secretary of State.  It is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  Again, the aim was to try to elicit some more clarity.  Following on from the Court of Appeal in the McCourt judgment, I am conscious that the Secretary of State has significant amount of flexibility in triggering this process.  My letters were really an attempt to try to get a bit more transparency and a bit more detail as to what precisely the Secretary of State does in this regard, for example, what evidence he relies on in reaching his judgment.  I had basic questions on how often the Secretary of State reviews the relevant evidence.  I believe this would be helpful for everyone on this island because, of course, the right to self-determination belongs to the people of this island.  Clarity would be helpful.  I have had two responses so far.  I have shared correspondence with the committee members and a bit more widely.  The committee members can reach their own conclusions from the responses.  My view is clear.  The response was from a group within the Northern Ireland Office.  The Secretary of State has fundamentally failed to answer the detailed questions raised in my letter.  To my mind this shows a profound lack of respect for the people of this island.  My questions remain unanswered.  I very much wish this committee all the best in having more luck than I had in getting detailed responses from the Secretary of State.  It is very important.  While it is not the only task at the moment, it is one part of the jigsaw.  It is a piece in the jigsaw of moving towards these referendums taking place.  The Secretary of State needs to provide detailed answers.<\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Bassett I will address briefly the Senator's second question.  Universities have a fundamentally important role in this regard.  A remarkable amount of work is currently ongoing such as the work of the ARINS project with the University of Notre Dame.  Reference was also made to the work at the University of Liverpool.  There is work going on at Queen's University Belfast, Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  In some senses the preparatory work has started and other people are, essentially, catching up.  This is all very valuable in fleshing out some of the rather technical and boring detailed questions that need to be answered in advance.  I would encourage that this work is continued.  I would also encourage the committee and others to support that work.  There is work to be done, for example, in establishing research programmes to facilitate that.  There is an opportunity to support research, for example, by the shared island unit.  I know it can be a bit nervous about going near the subject but I do not think it needs to be.  The shared island unit can talk about how we share the island now and how we might share it in the future.  Perhaps that unit could support and fund some of the work.  Organisations such as Universities Ireland, which provides a co-ordinating role for universities across the island, could support the work so we are talking to each other and analysing the sort of detailed questions that arise.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, I hope the committee is clear today, and from our last engagement, that our work is all about making sure we challenge myths, that we have an informed and evidence-based approach, and that we do the work in advance.  This is bearing in mind what Dr. Farry said about this being a condition-led process and that we are not bounced into a border poll, so that when the time comes the people North and South will know precisely what they are voting for, that nobody is painting false promises on the backs of buses, and that it is a verifiable, credible and evidence-based conversation, whatever the outcome may then be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":898,"content":"<p>On the point about the Constitution, there is a lot to admire about the Irish Constitution.  It takes in fundamental rights and judicial review from the American tradition.  It has features of parliamentary democracy, which we can see have been taken from England.  A central feature of the Constitution is that it was drafted, adopted and amended with unity in mind.  Some of the most important features of the document are now Articles 2 and 3.  They can accommodate a united Ireland, subject to some specific amendments.  A vote in the North for reunification should be seen as a compliment.  For the most part and in the main, the State has been a success.  There are some aspects of the Irish Constitution that are very much admired in the North.  Participation in the referendums on the repeal of the eighth amendment and on same-sex marriage, and going further back the contribution of the electorate to approving or rejecting European treaties, was not something that was available in the UK with its different constitutional set up.<br\/><br\/>We must keep in mind that with the UK vision for Northern Ireland we can see the priorities of Britain are very different to the priorities in the North.  The vote for Brexit was not replicated in the North.  The form of Brexit that was chosen primarily by English MPs and the current UK Government could not be replicated on the island of Ireland.  The mitigation of that is the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is nobody's first choice.  Nobody would design this from first principles as the best way.  Northern Ireland is outside the European Union.  There is a lot of unionist unhappiness with the practical outworkings of the protocol.  Next year there will be an assembly election and two years after that there will be a vote on certain limited aspects of the protocol, particularly its rules on the free movement of goods, internal taxation, state aid and so on.  If there is an assembly that votes to reject those aspects of the protocol, we are still left with the conundrum that it is an EU and Irish priority that there is no hard border on the island.  It is a UK priority also.  Articles 5 to 10 that are in the protocol now will have to be amended, but something similar is going to have to come back and it is going to have to get the same sort of outcome.  There were opportunities for less divergence in Britain but there is no political support for that.  The future for Northern Ireland, the vote for union is a vote for being outside the European Union but in a protocol.  As Professor Harvey has said, the task is for those of us who do believe in Irish reunification to come up with something more attractive than what is on offer from the current <i>status quo<\/i>for the medium-term future for Northern Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

The word \"Aont&uacute;\" means \"unity\".  It is our primary goal as a political movement.<\/p> <p>  One of the interesting issues that came from the debate last night on RT&Eacute; was the fact that most people now accept there will be a referendum.  Even Gregory Campbell accepts that there will be a referendum.  One of the fascinating elements of last night's debate was the fact that the penny has not dropped with the southern Government.  A referendum will be called independently of what the southern Government thinks and the southern Government has no actual role in whether a referendum is called.  It will be called on the basis of whether there is likely to be a majority in favour of unity.<\/p> <p>  We see a reluctance of preparation among some of the southern political establishment.  We could see a referendum being called for five years' time.  Yet, the southern Government has actually carried out no practical work in preparation whatsoever for that referendum.  That would create a political crisis if it were the case.  It would be similar to the British finding themselves having a Brexit referendum with absolutely no political preparation in advance.<\/p> <p>  The type of preparation we should be looking at is convergence.  I always look at the Border as a wall with 100 bricks.  Each brick is a point of economic or social divergence.  Each brick is a significant economic or social cost to the people.  It is a difference in cancer treatment or income taxes.  It is a difference in ambulance services or policing.  It is a difference in drug treatment, third level education or road and rail infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Some years ago I carried out a report for the then Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the all-Ireland economy.  Believe it or not, it was the first report carried out in the Oireachtas on the all-Ireland economy since the foundation of the State.  I interviewed approximately 100 people from all different backgrounds in the North, including unionists, nationalists and those in between.  Everyone agreed to the logic that if we plan, fund and deliver services together, they would be, by definition, better services and more efficient.  Regardless of whether we look at it through the unity prism, it will make a major difference in the lives of people.  This type of convergence means that on the sunny day when there is unity, there will not be a shock transition since there would have been a gradual convergence on both sides of the island in terms of the economy and society.<\/p> <p>  Senator Blaney spoke about how we should not coerce people from a unionist background into a united Ireland, and I agree.  We need to attract, convince and persuade people about the benefits of unity.  The Senator's view was echoed by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste last night.  However, they are forgetting that a minority veto is a form of coercion.  If a minority of unionists decide nationalists cannot be part of a united Ireland, that is a form of coercion.  The mechanism we have in a democracy to prevent that type of coercion is one whereby citizens sign up to the democratic will and signing up to the democratic will is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am amazed that some within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael seem to be rowing back on that democratic principle.  There is a danger in this, because it suggests there is one rule for the democratic will of nationalists and a separate rule for the democratic will of unionists.  It changes the goalposts mid-flow and guts the majoritarian cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement.  I would caution the establishment parties against going down that road.  We all need to agree to sign up to the democratic will of the people, North and South.  There should be no ifs, buts or other caveats in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for our two esteemed guests regarding the issue of a civic forum or new Ireland forum.  My instinct on this is that those of us in Aont&uacute; would like to see a new Ireland forum.  We would like to see a situation whereby all in civic and political society across Ireland are invited to participate in a forum.  The purpose of the forum would be to look at possible areas of convergence that are beneficial mutually to both sides of the community, North and South, and to the rest of the island.  We could then work out what such an all-Ireland would look like.  My concern is that in a citizens' forum many of the stakeholders who exist, especially those on the unionist side in the North of Ireland, would not believe they have a say in exactly the direction we are going.  That is my question.  Should we not look for a new Ireland forum based on the model used by Garret FitzGerald around the Anglo-Irish Agreement?  Under that framework, all those from political and civic society across the island could be invited to discuss how we deal with the worst aspects of Brexit, how we converge, how we create unity of purpose and how we build towards Irish unity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#K00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak again to our two esteemed witnesses.  This is an important report.  It is important to highlight that it is an academic research tool to assist the discussion on the importance of planning and preparing for constitutional change.  There is no doubt that many people have said we need to do more work on this.  That is important to say.<\/p><p>I believe those in civic society are doing great work on this.  Ireland's Future is an organisation committed to planning and preparing for constitutional change.  It is a rights-based organisation created to protect the civil and religious liberties of all traditions and identities in Ireland in a spirit of mutual respect.  That is the basis of the organisation.  I believe that more work is required from the Government and people within political and elected leadership.  That is important.<\/p><p>I am keen to get the thoughts of our two witnesses.  We know there is a desire for a border poll following <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>survey recently in February.  It reported that 51% of the people in the North supported a border poll being held within five years.  My concern is that this does not reflect the State's readiness or willingness to openly discuss the possibility of a referendum.  What more could parliamentarians do to promote productive discussion and conversations on facilitating a border poll and referendum?  Those in civic society, including Ireland's Future, are having these discussions.  Plenty of events have taken place and another is due to take place this Thursday on the economy.  That is the reality.  People want to know.  My family live in north Antrim.  These are the questions they want answered.  They want to know about the impact on health, housing and education and what a new Ireland would look like.<\/p><p>These conversations are already happening.  They are happening around the kitchen table all of the time.  I welcomed last night's discussion.  It was a very vibrant and healthy discussion.<\/p><p> The question I want to ask is how we, as parliamentarians, can promote productive discussions and conversations around facilitating a referendum?  I have to say I am concerned, and in saying so I have to highlight the importance of planning and preparing, that at any time, the Secretary of State could call a border poll and we would not be ready.

We talked about other models, about Garret FitzGerald and different ways of doing things.

I had difficulty joining.  I endorse the comments made by my colleague, Senator Niall Blaney, that the debate has to be inclusive.  There is a danger we will not have everyone participating, including people from different political viewpoints.  I want to see a united Ireland, but if we have a minimalist approach, then we will do damage and will put back the day when we will achieve a united Ireland.  We would be denying a large cohort of the Irish people the ambition they want to achieve in the proper circumstances.  Going back to Albert Reynolds's comments in December 1993, when the Downing Street Declaration was signed with John Major on 15 December, on that day, both the former Taoiseach, the late Albert Reynolds, and Mr. Major spoke about the need not to have a minimalist approach.  They spoke generosity being needed on all sides.  It is very important in that respect that we approach this with an inclusive agenda.<\/p><p>Mr. Harvey spoke about long-term planning, and I totally agree with that.  There has to be an understanding of the other side's position.  The Chairman and I are probably the only two committee members who were Members of the Oireachtas at the time of the Downing Street Declaration and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  At that time, we clearly understood the political message that was given to us by our parties, which was the need to understand the other side's position and the difficulties they encountered in reaching an agreement.  Having talked to Bertie Ahern, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Blair and the late John Hume, and others who contributed so much to achieving the Good Friday Agreement, they were always generous, patient and understanding of the other side's position.<\/p><p>People speak about citizens' assemblies.  We have elected forums and it is these which have to do the preparatory work on what we all want to achieve in a proper way.  Mr. Harvey mentioned that the Good Friday Agreement provides the mechanism, quite rightly, to achieve a united Ireland.  That is in an international agreement endorsed by the people, North and South, on 22 May 1998.  If we were to have spoken to people in March of 1998 and said in a <i>vox pop<\/i>on any street in any county in any part of our island that, within a number of weeks, we would have a mechanism to achieve a united Ireland, I do not think the public at large at that time would have thought we would make that progress.  We have the mechanism, thankfully, but we did not have it prior to May 1998.<\/p><p>Mr. Harvey spoke the previous day about commitments already made.  Did Mr. Harvey or Mr. Bassett, in the course of their work, do an inventory of what has not been done pertaining to the commitments laid out in the Good Friday Agreement and in its successor agreements?  If we are to move successfully to achieving a united Ireland, then we must implement and maximise the potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the successor agreements.  We have seen what a lack of preparation did in regard to Brexit.  Surely, we want a referendum where the homework will have been done and there will not be a mentality on either side that they are being forced into something.<\/p><p>Mr. Harvey also spoke about the shared island unit and others have a massive role in ensuring the practical co-operation on this island is stepped up.  Institutions on this island do not engage or talk to each other anywhere near enough.  We should focus at the moment on maximising the agreements we have in place, maximising co-operation, and ensuring the &euro;500 million already committed to the shared island initiatives is drawn down and that practical co-operation for the benefit of all the people of this island is advanced.  Momentum is needed to ensure we deliver on what is achievable through those agreements, particularly the Good Friday Agreement, which is an international agreement.  That is an incremental and necessary approach for us to have in place the necessary framework to achieve a united Ireland in due time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#L00500","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I echo my colleague, Deputy Smith, in all of what he said.

We need to have this discussion and we need dialogue between all parties.<\/p> <p>  A majority of members on this committee are very much in favour of a united Ireland.  The elephant in the room is the fact we do not have enough of the divergent voices at this committee meeting.  Referring to what Deputy Smith said, have we fulfilled the Good Friday Agreement?  Last night, Naomi Long made a very valid comment.  To paraphrase her, she said that if there is a divided Northern Ireland, there will not be a united Ireland.  Northern Ireland is divided in terms of flags.  How are we going to bring along people?  We need to bring them along.  We need clear actions and a path forward.  I will jump on that path but we need a correct path.  It needs clear actions.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, that it is about convergence.  How do we work east-west and North-South on converging our island to make it a single island and to make it stick?  A hundred years on, where are we in regard to partition?  We do not want to be 200 years on or 100 years on from a border poll and still be at the top of that hill, and still be divided.  Unionists are still very much a part of this island.  We need to start celebrating a shared history and our shared past.  Going back to my own personal story, the McGreehans landed in Castletowncooley straight after the Battle of the Boyne, when William cleared out north County Louth.<\/p><p>We came afterwards and plenty of unionists came along with that wave.  We could say that I came with the unionists and with that story.  It is part of my story and we are still living and farming in Castletowncooley to this day.  It is a similar path to that of many people on this island who are very proud of it and we need to embrace it.  We need to look at how we can jump on a path together.  It really does need to be part of a convergence and part of an inclusive story.<\/p><p> To go back to another Louth person, D'Arcy McGee went to Canada and helped to created much of the democracy there and brought together people in Canada united in diversity.  If this committee were to bring about anything it should be to be very clear that we need to be united in all our diversity.

There are three phases to this, namely, prior to the vote, the vote itself and after the vote.  All of these are fraught with challenges, opportunities and potential difficulties.  The way I see the preparation time and the convergence is that, as members have acknowledged, the excellent academic work is being done.  The part that is missing is political liaison and it is missing big time.  With all our articulation here today, nobody from the unionist community is giving us their views.  This is a huge gap.<\/p> <p>  The vote is one thing.  The report itemises the difficulties of exercising the franchise in the North compared with England and Scotland.  This is a major issue.

I will start by saying we have underlined in our work that we need to stick to the Good Friday Agreement parameters and framework.  Nobody here wants to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement, and this is our starting point.  The rules are reasonably clear already.<\/p> <p>  When we speak about sharing the island now and in the future, the Irish State and civil society have the capacity to do two things at once.  In other words, we must think about how we share this island better in the here and now.  Nothing we are saying is contrary to this.  In fact, we think this work needs to be stepped up and the work of the shared island unit on this is very welcome and is to be encouraged and supported.  We also need to think about how we plan and prepare for how we will share the island in future.  This is in the Good Friday Agreement.  We are speaking about the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement today.  What we are speaking about is a normal everyday part of the constitutional framework in the agreement about how we might share the island in future.  We need to address it in this framework and tone and we need to do the preparatory work on this.  The worry, and what inspires a lot of our work, is that there is a bit too much complacency.  There is a bit too much that sounds like prevarication on not wanting to do the difficult homework.  There is a sense of doing it tomorrow or putting it off until next week.  Some of the motivation for the timeframe is slight frustration that while many people do not want to face difficult homework nobody is doing anybody any favours, on the committee or elsewhere, by avoiding the hard work on preparing and planning.<\/p> <p>  There is another point on civic engagement.  At the centre of many proposals at present is the idea of an all-island citizens' assembly on Ireland's future.  Although a variety of other models have been pointed out, including involving politicians, we are particularly aware that citizens and civic engagement North and South have to be central to shaping this discussion.  It cannot be an elite-led discussion in which, in a sense, professors such as me in a university dictate the models for the future.  I would much rather that these proposals and options are discussed and debated among people and they emerge from the conversation, shaped by the evidence, expertise and comparative experience.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas, as the Legislature, has a vital role.  Nothing is either-or.  We can have a citizens' assembly and we can also have Oireachtas committees working away and doing vital work.  Too many of these discussions are dominated by governments.  We need legislatures to step up here and elsewhere to help in the preparatory task.  The work cannot be taken on alone even by a citizens' assembly.  It has to be done by others.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith made a comment on the agreement.  What we are speaking about is central to the agreement.  This is about the implementation of the agreement.  Although we are focusing on the referendums we also need to underline, and I agree, that other parts of the agreement have not been implemented.  I have spent many years of my life working on equality and human rights.  For example, Northern Ireland, the North, this region needs a bill of rights.  This is still not implemented.  It is not either-or.  We can do more than one thing at once.  This is about implementing the agreement in the longer term.  Ultimately, for those on the side of constitutional change it is about ensuring the constitutional arrangements that emerge are successful and work and that everybody is better off at the far end of all of this.

This is the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic in which, of the more than 120 million cases worldwide, more than 230,000 have been in Ireland.  Sadly, more than 2.6 million people have lost their lives, including 4,587 in Ireland, of whom 2,009 have been in nursing homes.  The continuing levels of high daily case numbers remain of ongoing concern.<\/p> <p>  Nationally and internationally, older people and particularly those in nursing homes have been especially impacted.  Nursing homes are where more than 30,000 of our citizens call home and residents of nursing homes are vulnerable to Covid-19 for a variety of reasons.  Consistent with the learning arising from the pandemic to date, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the expert panel and HIQA highlight that the probability of Covid-19 introduction into these settings depends on the level of Covid-19 circulation in the community.  Ireland has put in place a comprehensive set of public health measures, actions and responses that align with each of the ECDC-advised options to help manage and mitigate this risk to residents of long-term residential care.<\/p> <p>  Sustained communication and interagency co-operation remain central to the response to Covid-19.  Guidance, personal protective equipment, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private.  In addition, multidisciplinary clinical supports are in place at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level through 23 Covid-19 response teams.  Fundamental to this is the continued and determined professional care provided by healthcare workers in nursing homes 24 hours a day.  Throughout the pandemic to date, about one third of nursing homes have remained Covid-outbreak free, while many nursing homes that did experience an outbreak managed very well.<\/p> <p>  While there is much to be hopeful about following the Government prioritisation of vaccination of older people and healthcare workers, the challenges associated with the pandemic will continue for the foreseeable future.  A vaccination effect is being seen, however, and the number of open outbreaks in nursing homes now stands at 68, down from 178 on 21 February.  In addition, this week sees a significant step in restoring meaningful contact through enhanced visiting guidance for nursing homes, whereby each resident can now have two face-to-face visits a week in light of a high rate of vaccination in the nursing home.<\/p> <p>  Following the recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in May 2020, a Covid-19 expert panel on nursing homes was established to provide immediate, real-time learnings to the Minister for Health.  This panel made a substantial package of 86 recommendations in 15 thematic areas and was published on 19 August.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people committed to progressing these recommendations and established an implementation framework with a priority focus on key short-term public health and protective measures.  This framework includes an interagency implementation oversight team and a stakeholder reference group.  Early progress on implementation of recommendations is evident and a second progress report has been published.  In summary, the areas worth highlighting include assurance of the ongoing HIQA and HSE public health supports and in particular the role of serial testing and Covid response teams, the governance systems put in place by the HSE and HIQA, additional funding for the provision of integrated infection prevention and control measures, the delivery of sustained and intensive education and information campaigns and the establishment and preliminary work of the task force on safe staffing.<\/p> <p>  A paper reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s actions in light of the key national options in respect of mitigating and managing Covid-19 in long-term care has aligned well to the November ECDC risk assessment, and this paper was published and discussed by NPHET.  In regard to regulation, the Department is in broad agreement with the recommendations of the expert panel and HIQA with regard to the need to enhance the current regulatory frameworks for older people and the need to reform the regulatory model.  Over recent months, the Department has sanctioned additional inspectorate staff for HIQA to support a sustained increase in the frequency of inspections.  The Minister for Health has approved the development of interim enhancements to the current regulatory framework for nursing homes this year, with a view to commencing a longer-term review of nursing home regulation in 2022, and recently requested that HIQA undertake an up-to-date international evidence review of nursing home regulatory models to support and inform this wider review.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the Department is focused on interim enhancements to the legislation through a bilateral project group supported by HIQA.  Detailed work is advancing on legislative proposals that, subject to Government approval, will aim to enhance the enforcement and oversight powers of the chief inspector, including through additional enforcement tools such as compliance notices, obligations for all nursing homes to report key operational data to HIQA and make the data public, exploration of measures to enhance transparency, and increased legal underpinning of infection prevention and control obligations, along with other improvements.<\/p> <p>  Home care is essential to support older people to live in their homes for as long as possible.  Investment in home support services has increased by 66% since 2017 and more than &euro;666 million has been allocated in 2021 to provide 24 million home support hours to 56,000 people.  This includes 360,000 hours for intensive home care packages.  In addition, the HSE national service plan commits &euro;10 million to the roll-out of the interRAI standard assessment tool and to establish a national home support office.  A programme of work to advance the statutory home support scheme is well under way.  The Government will soon be asked to approve the principle of moving to introduce a licensing framework for professional home support providers, underpinned by legislation, in line with the programme for Government commitment.  Throughout 2021, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is conducting research on behalf of the Department on the projected demand for, and cost of, home support provision across a range of models for the financing of the statutory home support scheme.<\/p><p>This work will build on projections for the future demand for home support as set out in various reports, including the Department of Health's Health Service Capacity Review 2018, which forecast that a 120% increase in home support services will be required by 2031 if the health system is fully reformed.<\/p><p> In summary, Covid-19 has highlighted the important need to move to new models of care for older people.  This will involve short and long-term reform across government in order to provide new housing models, new home first care models and where long-term care is needed, that it is provided with innovative designs that can meet infection prevention and control requirements and provide a home for those who need this type of care.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan also fully recognises pandemic learning and the reform requirements, including commitments to commence planning towards a longer term rebalancing of the public-private nursing home mix.  Sl&aacute;intecare provides the overall framework of right care, right place, right time in order to support older people to continue to live in the community in their own homes for as long as possible, thereby participating to their full potential in economic and social life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Quinn to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I thank members for the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting.  We welcome the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Health.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Mary Dunnion, chief inspector of social services and director of regulation; Ms Susan Cliffe, deputy chief inspector of social services for older persons; and Mr. Finbarr Colfer, deputy chief inspector of social services for disability services.<\/p> <p>  As some members will recall, in September 2020, HIQA appeared before a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response at which our report on the impact of the pandemic on nursing homes in Ireland was discussed.  We are happy to take any questions regarding this and our experience of the regulation of residential services subsequent to its publication.<\/p> <p>  In respect of my opening statement, I wish to focus on the background and recommendations of HIQA&rsquo;s report on the need for regulatory reform of the social care sector, published in February of this year.  The report, titled The Need for Regulatory Reform, reinforces the insights we have gained while contending with the arrival and impact of the highly infectious coronavirus, Covid-19.  In particular, the report highlights the impact on citizens living in residential services and has raised a number of questions as to how we care for vulnerable people.  In essence, the practices and models underpinning service provision that were previously acceptable are no longer so.  It is important to note that Covid-19 has not in itself signalled the need for regulatory reform; rather, it has shone a spotlight on an issue that was already in need of urgent consideration.<\/p> <p>  As a consequence of our experience as a regulator in the sector, HIQA has submitted its views to the Government on how regulations and enforcement in the interim of wider regulatory reform could be enhanced with a view to strengthening key areas related to the pandemic, for example, infection prevention and control, staffing, governance and clinical oversight.  Therefore, our report on regulatory reform should be seen as contributing to the development of a wider social care strategy and national policy, separate and distinct from any immediate or interim requirements related to Covid-19. <\/p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s report on the need for regulatory reform recognises that social care in Ireland is changing.  The institutional and residential approaches towards the provision of care for older people and people with a disability are being challenged.  Although Covid-19 has highlighted deficiencies in the legislation which regulates social care services, many weaknesses have persisted in recent years, due in large part to the evolving nature of service provision.  <\/p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s experience of inspecting centres and assessing compliance with regulations and standards has produced a wealth of knowledge on the quality and safety of services.  It has also allowed us to develop insights into how the regulatory framework is serving the interests of people who use and provide services.  This report outlines some key regulatory areas which require a dynamic, all-encompassing national health and social care strategy and policy development.  These include the reform of the Health Act 2007 to take account of the changing landscape in health and social care services; a comprehensive review of the current regulations pertaining to health and social care services in Ireland, and the establishment of a regular review process; the introduction of regulation into other forms of care that are currently unregulated and whose service users may be vulnerable; consideration of the development of a comprehensive, integrated social care policy that considers social care in its totality; and a framework that makes a clear distinction between the purchaser and provider of services along with clear governance and accountability arrangements.<\/p> <p>  While there has been a justified focus on how we care for older citizens, it is imperative that there are equitable protections for people with a disability in need of social care and support.  Disability service providers continue to explore and develop ways to move citizens currently living in congregated settings into services in the community, in line with national policy.  In September of last year, HIQA published its annual overview report on the inspection and regulation of residential services for people with a disability.  One key finding was that residents living in congregated settings experience a poorer quality of life compared with those who live and receive care and support in community settings.  In developing new residential services, providers have said they want to keep residents within the protection of regulation.  However, the current regulations can be overly restrictive when it comes to the development of innovative new models such as partnerships between other service providers and families to develop individual responses to the care and support of those with complex needs.<\/p> <p>  HIQA welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to make home care available on a statutory basis.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme has outlined the roadmap to transform health and social care provision.  Regulatory reform is necessary to ensure that the services provided have the capacity and capability to deliver care and support that meet people&rsquo;s needs in a manner that offers quality, safety and the protection of people&rsquo;s rights.  There is also a strong argument for the development of an overarching social care policy that sets out core objectives, governance and legislative frameworks across the sector at large.  The development and implementation of such a policy would help integrate diverse forms of social care and serve to complement Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.<\/p> <p>  HIQA very much welcomes the recommendations contained in the final report of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel of 2020.  It frames clearly the steps which must be taken in order to optimise the response to Covid-19 in care facilities for the elderly.  HIQA will continue to share its knowledge and insights of the sector into the implementation oversight team that was created as a result of the panel&rsquo;s report.<\/p> <p>  It is HIQA&rsquo;s view that the provision of health and social services should be subject to a regulatory framework which is fit for purpose, adaptable to changing needs and preferences and responsive to risk and concerns for people&rsquo;s welfare.  This may, in part, be achieved by developing a policy that considers social care in its entirety, given that the principal issues are consistent across all populations who use social care services.  HIQA hopes that The Need for Regulatory Reform report forms an integral part of the debate on how we can better care for our citizens into the future.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their attention this morning.

These are the competency requirements at the point of interview.  Thereafter, there is a 12-week induction programme for all newly appointed inspectors that covers all the relevant areas, including the legislative framework, the inspection process and the methodologies.  As Mr. Quinn said, we will certainly ensure the Deputy gets that information requested if he has not received it already.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, the specific training for our inspection staff that has been very targeted relates to the national guidelines from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in the context of Covid-19 infection prevention and control.  All our staff are trained in that area, and there is ongoing didactic learning and online learning.  There is guidance and there is an assessment framework.  In addition, we have run many webinars for nursing home providers and disability service providers and their staff.  Those webinars covered all aspects of our infection methodology for infection prevention and control.  As Dr. MacLellan said, there has been an increase in our number of inspectors.  We have increased the number by a total of 12 in respect of the nursing home expert panel, and we are currently at the point of induction for many of those positions.

I read the opening statements and submissions and there is mention by both of legislation for the regulation of home care providers and research by the ESRI on how we would finance an increase in the provision of home care in the long term.  I have met a number of advocates for increasing home care services and one of the immediate barriers raised with me is the timely transfer of information and the assessment issues from the service provider, such as the medical facility, nursing homes or the care settings the people are in, to the home care setting.  I presume that requires a review of the home and an assessment of supports.  That would be particularly relevant for people with disabilities, and I have a particular interest in that.  I presume it would need a multidisciplinary team and requires a level of capacity in those settings to carry out that handover moment.  While we have heard a little about the required legislation and the possible funding of it, what actions is the HSE taking now to put structures in place?  What is the capacity among care providers to facilitate the transfer of service users from one setting to another?

In addition, that will be common across the setting where the person could be coming from, perhaps a home, a hospital or a residential rehabilitation or reablement service, and planning to move home.

I have a number of questions related to what happened in the nursing homes last year.  It makes for sombre reading that 45% of all those who have died in this State of Covid had been in the nursing home setting.  My first question relates to Dr. MacLellan's concluding remark in her opening statement that the HSE national service plan fully recognises pandemic learning and reform requirements, including commitments to commence planning towards a longer term rebalancing of public and private nursing home mix.  There is a disparate mix in nursing home ownership in that 80% is private and only 20% is public.  What does Dr. MacLellan mean in terms of the rebalancing of the public and private mix?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#F00600","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":993,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The HSE is looking at a reform framework for long-term residential care, including opportunities for increasing direct public provision in relation to long-term residential care which will decrease some reliance on the private sector, but also looking at the types of long-term residential care that are being provided.  One of the big learnings we would all take on board is that if we can reduce the number of congregated settings for people to live in that would be helpful in terms of protecting them around infection prevention and control.  The HSE is looking at ideas such as support villages, own-door services and different types of configurations of long-term residential care.  It has committed to that and there has been significant funding put in place to look at new types of intermediate care, rehabilitation beds within the community and expanding home care as well.  <\/p> <p>  Part of the planning around the statutory home care scheme requires that we would look at care of the older person as a new model such that there will be a continuum of care and it is not the case that automatically the decision is made that a person would go to long-term care or receive home care.  As described by Ms O'Neill, the decision-making will start with the standard assessment tool, which will look at the needs of older people and, in deciding those needs, look to what supports can be provided within the community, moving towards long-term residential care, as needed.  The new home first model is already being tested by the HSE.  The goal will be to reduce the number of people within long-term residential care and the length of time that they would spend there such that the admissions would be appropriate and then to look to the broader provision of both by the HSE in terms of publicly provided long-term care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":994,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. MacLellan.

Clearly, our report is centred on all these things.  The first point to make is that the incidence in the community is a very important driver to risk.  That was true, unfortunately, at the outset of this, when we were dealing with it last spring, and now it has again become very clear that as we have been going through this period, in January and February, community incidence and incidence generally is an important driver.  That is one important factor.  Dr. MacLellan referred earlier to the fact that a report will be published shortly, we hope, which was undertaken jointly between HIQA and the HSE's HPSE and which will look at protective factors and risk factors based on the data that were available.  The international evidence all points us to the fact that this is a very serious, highly contagious infectious disease whose natural history and management were, in the early stages, very important features; that congregated settings are risky environments for a whole variety of reasons related to transmission of risk; and that in the nursing home setting older people and those who have underlying conditions were particularly susceptible.  Of course, there is also the big question of preparedness that was so important then and remains so now.  There are, therefore, a constellation of factors at play here that are very important.  In the first six months of our reviewing preparedness, all the things that required stepping up have been stepped up.  It remains the case, more so than ever, that they should be sustained and that we should have long-term supports in place that would maintain that level of preparedness going into the future.  It was therefore a mixture of factors: the incidence in the wider, general population, the management of the condition, the degree of preparedness in the setting and the fact that congregated settings are inherently risky environments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Cecily Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>Regarding knowledge of the sector at the start of the pandemic, would Professor Kelleher say the expert panel is now satisfied with its knowledge of the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>It is a key piece that has been brought out across the discussions this morning and of which the expert panel was aware.

The good news now in terms of the positive trends that were referred to earlier is that where we have outbreaks, the level and severity, as Dr. MacLellan said, are much lower, so we would be talking about an average of perhaps four staff being on leave.

I join others in welcoming them today.<\/p> <p>  A big feature of the first wave of Covid was that GPs were not going into private nursing homes.  It was simply, in their view, too risky to be going into them, offering a level of GP care and then risking transmitting the virus within the broader community.  Of course, there has been a significant ramping up of vaccinations since early January.  I wish to ask our witnesses whether that has improved.  Are the medical needs of people in private nursing homes now being fully met when a GP locally is required to be on site?  Are GPs coming in?  Can they come in?  Is all that being facilitated on site and off site?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L01500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>I might start, if that would be helpful.  Obviously, the GP's direct relationship is with the private nursing home, and there is guidance in place on visits of healthcare professionals to nursing homes and their duties.  One of the real things we saw during Covid was the additional expert support that was needed for nursing homes to support residents, be that geriatrician support, palliative care support or GP clinical support.<\/p><p>The standing up of the 23 Covid response teams across the CHOs has been a significant game changer in the level of clinical support that has been and continues to be available to nursing homes.  One of the recommendations of the expert panel is that we move to put those teams on a permanent footing within the communities as community support teams and we are at a preliminary stage of considering how we can start that transition phase.  It will provide that there can be a lot more clinical expertise available on an ongoing basis.  That will fit well with the development of the community networks within the community as well.

Is there any quarantining happening in nursing homes?  I will be more specific in what I am asking.  I know of a number of cases where an individual may have been discharged from hospital in recent weeks but had not yet been vaccinated for Covid.  Rather than going home, it was deemed necessary that this person would go to a step-down facility, that is, a private nursing home close to the person's residence.  However, the nursing home residents had all been vaccinated.  Therefore, an unvaccinated older person went into a nursing home environment without having been vaccinated.  How is that being catered for within the sector?  That will improve week-on-week as vaccines roll out but are there mechanisms in place to cater for that?

I am one of the deputy commissioners at the Data Protection Commission, DPC, with responsibility, among other things, for the DPC&rsquo;s supervision, consultation and guidance functions.  Also in attendance with me is Mr. David Murphy, assistant commissioner, from the DPC&rsquo;s supervision and consultation section.<\/p> <p>  The DPC welcomes the opportunity to engage with the committee on the proposed Bill and to provide our views on the draft provisions that impact, in our view, on the processing of personal data.  By way of background, I can inform the committee that the Data Protection Commission submitted contributions to the public consultation on proposals to modernise the electoral process held in 2019.  In contributing to the public consultations, we welcomed the Department&rsquo;s goal of building an electoral register that is secure, comprehensive and accurate, while also being fully compliant with data protection legislation.  In view of the very substantial volume of data involved, the establishment and maintenance of an accurate and secure central electoral register, in particular, is of critical importance to the public&rsquo;s trust in the proposed reforms.  Our observations in the public consultations related to the use of the PPSN, in particular, and to the sharing of personal data for the purposes of updating and maintaining the register.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the proposed use of the PPSN, the DPC advised that any use of the it must be shown to be a justifiable solution to identified issues with the electoral register, while not having a disproportionate impact on an individual&rsquo;s right to data protection.  We stated that the assessment should address known vulnerabilities with the PPSN such as the potential for fraudulent use.  In looking at the use of the PPSN, it may also be necessary to examine whether the legal basis for the PPSN, as found in the social welfare Acts, can support the issuance of a PPSN to an individual for the sole purpose of registering as an elector.  This is a scenario that could conceivably arise in the case of European and local elections while recalling that the purpose of a PPSN is to allow an individual to engage with the State in the course of a transaction with a State body.  There may be scenarios where not everyone has a PPSN.  We do not have a definitive answer on that but we have certainly think it is something worth considering.<\/p> <p>  As part of a general recommendation to adopt a data protection-by-design approach, we recommended the use of a data protection impact assessment, DPIA, to explore fully the data protection risks involved and to consider the implementation of suitable and specific safeguards.  We also pointed out that any use of MyGovID or the public services card for optional online registration should be examined to ensure that there is a valid legal basis for such processing.<\/p> <p>  The Committee should also be aware we engaged with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Bill.  We understand the Department is currently conducting a data protection impact assessment and the DPC will be formally consulted under Article 36 of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, during this process.  In particular, the Department&rsquo;s assessment should set out the rationale and justification for the mandatory collection of the PPSN and use of the public service identity set.  The Department must remain open to alternative solutions should the justification of the use of those data elements not be satisfactorily grounded, or where there is potentially an inability to mitigate any identified high risk to the personal data of individuals, whether or not those persons are included on the electoral register.  That is not to prejudge the issue.  It is simply to say that the purpose of a DPIA is to go through all of those issues, to ensure there is a justifiable basis and the processing is proportionate and necessary.  We also recommend the publication of any DPIAs and ancillary supporting documentation developed during the process in the interests of transparency for the public and trust of the public in the process, and to provide the reasons why certain data sets may be required.<\/p> <p>  In our submission to the committee we made a number of remarks on our view on specific provisions of the general scheme.  In the interest of time, I will not mention them all but I will go through some of them.  In relation to the national electoral register shared central database, we understand under head 90 that the database is for the purpose of management of registration data by a registration authority on behalf of others, including the provision of a public interface.  We recommend the carrying out of a data protection impact assessment prior to the implementation of this proposal, given the national scale of the database, and in particular to identify risks and appropriate safeguards.<\/p> <p>  The registration authorities must also determine their roles and responsibilities with regard to the controllership of personal data, and to ensure that these are underpinned by appropriate data processing agreements where necessary.  Further clarity may be required as to the operation of these provisions such as how discrepancies will be avoided between records held by registration authorities and the central database.  It may be the case that all records will be specifically held on the central database but it is not absolutely clear to us at this point how this would work in practice.  Any data processing must also be subject to appropriate safeguards including, where necessary, the implementation of data protection policies.  We also recommend consideration be given to whether further provisions are required in the Bill to set out how it is intended the existing electoral registers will be updated with additional personal data, such as the PPSN, on the enactment and commencement of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the use of the electoral register, as provided for under head 92, we note it is limited to electoral or other statutory purposes, with reference to the provisions of Sections 39 and 40 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  To underscore the point, any processing of personal data for a statutory purpose must comply with the data protection and e-privacy legislative frameworks in general, and in particular with the requirements of Article 6(3) of the GDPR, which requires that the basis of any processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest be laid down by EU or member state law.<\/p><p> Head 93 sets out the legal basis for the sharing of personal data for the purposes of verification of the accuracy of the register of electors and its updating and maintenance.  As I stated, the carrying out of a data protection impact assessment, DPIA, should be undertaken to establish the justification for the use of each element of the verification data set on the basis of necessity and to identify a clear legal basis for processing. <\/p><p> As with previous legislated uses of this data set, such as for the individual health identifier, it is expected that any use of the PSI data set will be limited to verification purposes and that the PPSN will not become a de facto unique identifier in the electoral register.  That is our understanding from our engagements with the Department.  The governance of, and access to, personal data used for verification purposes will be a key consideration for the DPIA process as well as the retention of any such data.<\/p><p> We note that consideration will be given to the timing of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019 and its bearing upon this section.  Notwithstanding that Act, the DPC recommends, for the purpose of providing an explicit legal basis in primary legislation for data sharing, that this head be retained and consideration be given to further specifying the modalities of data sharing in this Bill.  That is simply for the purpose of having specific clarity on the legal basis for data sharing. <\/p><p> We note head 121 on online political advertisements.  In part, this head sets out increased transparency around the public information requirements for online political advertisements.  Anyone engaging in online political advertising involving the processing of personal data must adhere to the relevant provisions of the data protection legislative frameworks.  We welcome this provision as it will bring an extra level of transparency to online political advertising, in particular as it relates to data protection, micro-targeting or the use of other advertising targeting lists.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it this evening.  I hope these comments will be of assistance in its deliberations and I am very happy to answer the questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to speak to it today.  It has been great to see cross-party consensus on the necessity of the Bill.  Making sure our elections run well is essential for our democratic health.  Protecting the integrity of our elections is more than a question of democratic health; it is a national security issue.  Recent international experience shows that complacency in this regard can have long-term damaging ramifications.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, our democratic processes are respected, although sometimes it feels as if this is in spite of rather than because of our fragmented and outdated electoral management system.  I believe the committee agrees with me on that point and it is an issue the Bill aims to address.  <\/p> <p>  The world has changed since the Electoral Acts were written.  Online political advertisements are a major innovation that has exposed loopholes in our rules.  In producing the Bill, Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe that have progressed lawmaking on political advertisements.  Taken in isolation, the provisions on advertisements are good.  There are legally binding obligations on platforms for transparency, a ban on the overseas purchase of political ads, which was a major loophole, and detailed requirements for imprints on individual ads.  From my experience and having consulted experts, the provisions could be strengthened, particularly if they were to require publication of advertisements to an archive as they happen in real time, a requirement that is missing from the proposed Bill, if transparency provisions were extended beyond the electoral period, and if the issue with the definition of \"political purposes\", as raised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom, were addressed.  While it is acknowledged in a footnote on page 7 that there is an issue with the current definition, it is maintained in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Social media advertisements are just one product and there is a risk that we will build legislation and an institution around a single product.  We have come to be concerned about online political advertising since the 2016 US presidential election and the UK Brexit vote because they now constitute a threat to the integrity of elections and represent an evolution in campaigning.  The use of technology in campaigning and attempts to undermine elections have evolved further since then.  There is a strong possibility that the Bill, as drafted, could be out of date by the time it reaches the Statute Book.<\/p> <p>  The most recent general election in Ireland saw the growth of digital campaigning.  Dr. Niamh Kirk in Dublin City University, DCU, did some great work on this.  The next general election is likely to see further reliance on online campaigning, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We could also see the adoption of new uses of campaign technology seen in recent elections elsewhere, including influencer advertising, which was a major source of spending in the US, the use of attack videos, so-called AstroTurf campaigns, super PAC-style online campaigns and, most worryingly, the manipulation of online discussion to suppress voter engagement.  We may also see issues emerge around the equal playing field, which is a value that is already implicit in our electoral laws, with online advertising markets set up in such a way that wealthier campaigns can drive up advertising costs and price out competition.  None of these issues is anticipated in the general scheme.  It is impossible to draft legislation that can account for each of these and continue to do so as new technologies emerge and can be manipulated and misused. <\/p> <p>  On threats to democracy, an example of where online advertisements contributed to threats to democracy was international interference campaigns over social media platforms, enabling spending of money from outside the country to directly target voters.  We saw this in Ireland during the 2018 referendum.  In the past, these campaigns outside Ireland focused as much on voter suppression and engendering mistrust in institutions as they did on supporting or denigrating particular candidates.<\/p> <p>  The Bill prohibits the purchase of advertisements on social media platforms from outside the State and creates an offence if platforms fail to implement proper due diligence.  This is a really strong provision which fixes a current loophole.  However, we know that information and interference operations are broader than paid political advertisements.  This was evident last week when the US report on attempted interference in its most recent elections was published.  These operations are continually evolving to exploit new technology, such as messaging apps, fake profiles, viral unpaid content and so on.  It is also clear internationally that interference operations begin long before the official election period.  The Bill, as drafted, would not allow the Electoral Commission to assess the technology and act to address these and other evolving threats.  It does not mandate for transparency in political activity outside the narrowly defined periods.  This is a missed opportunity to address the lack of a statutory body in Ireland with responsibility for ensuring that Irish elections and referendums are free from international interference and predicting threats to electoral integrity.  We may feel that Ireland has room for complacency in this regard but the prospect of another EU referendum or, indeed, a border poll should worry us, especially in relation to maintaining voter trust in the process and outcome.  <\/p> <p>  As we establish our electoral commission, we should build an institution that is empowered to adapt as campaigning and threats to democracy evolve.  This is in line with the ambitions for the Bill set out by the Minister on its publication and before this committee.  However, the Bill, as drafted, is not quite there yet and would not create the institution that we need.  I agree with experts who have already been before the committee, Professor David Farrell, Dr. Jane Suiter and Dr. Theresa Reidy, who said the Bill is a static design for an ever-evolving dynamic environment.  Achieving this ambition will take innovative thinking with regard to the structure of and accountability for the new electoral commission.  There are some precedents for this in other fields such as environmental and health protection, for example, the precautionary principle.  Rather than set out in great detail how we might regulate some parts of campaign technology such as online advertisements, it is worth exploring whether the legislation could instead enforce standards and principles governing our elections and allow for the creation of an institution that is empowered to assess and create rules around transparency and also enforce transparency on new products and tactics as they emerge.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses at previous hearings mentioned the importance of ensuring in the legislation that the body is sufficiently funded, equipped with a research function and has funding to support independent research capable of assessing risks.<\/p><p>It would be positive if we could broaden the scope from just thinking about voter engagement to include actively monitoring and tackling any voter suppression operations, which we know the Internet is particularly suited to.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Carolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1107,"content":"<p>I always know we are going to have a good session when I agree with good chunks of both opening statements.

The question is whether we get it started or wait for the perfect.  That is always the decision of politicians.  I will come back to that but I only have five minutes so I will put some quick questions to Mr. Sunderland.  It is good to see him.  In a number of places, he spoke about seeking to find out if there is a legal basis for the use of the PPSN.

It is a tight item of legislation with restrictions around the use of the PPSN, so that is a lawful basis for the use of the PPSN where the individual is involved in a transaction with the State.  Other legislation in the past has provided for a legal basis, such as the Credit Reporting Act, which allows for the PPSN to be used as an identifier.  It has now been proposed to provide a legal basis through this Bill for the mandatory collection of PPSNs for the purposes of identity verification and checking to ensure the integrity of the electoral register.<\/p> <p>  The job for the Department is to look at every potential.  We link this back to the processing of personal data.  The processing of any personal data for any purpose requires a legal basis.  When it comes to the State processing personal data, we find that most generally in the primary legislation but also potentially in secondary legislation.  It is the job of the Department as it goes through the data protection impact assessment to make sure that in addition to what is proposed in this Bill, it has for all the purposes envisaged the appropriate legal basis underpinning any data processing.  I mention it in the context of further statutory purposes, which is quite a broad provision.  The purposes for which the PPS number would be used are explicit within this Bill but the question arises as to what does other statutory purposes mean.  One must find a basis in law for that.  One could not assume via collection through this process that one could automatically start using those data for other purposes.  The legislation around the PPSN is quite complex and intricate but the value of a data protection impact assessment is to tease all those issues out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>One of the requirements for printed advertising is that the person's name and address are published as somebody who is distributing information regarding an election.

It is a bit different from a core data protection issue where we are talking about the processing of personal data.  In the context of online advertisements, and the Bill touches on this, it comes up in the context of how people are presented with advertisements and who is presented with advertisements.  That comes from how their data are processed in the background for personalisation and other purposes.  It does not strike us that there is a problem with the Bill from a data protection perspective in that context but, again, we are just looking at the heads.  The onus is on the Department to have considered whether and to what extent personal data are being processed in that context and whether there is any risk involved.  Again, it is about the process and making sure the right balance is struck.  As the Deputy noted, it is already done in an offline context so if the legislator decides to provide for that in an online context, having done the proper assessments and analysis and having decided it is justified, that is what data protection is about.

I thank the witnesses for their opening remarks.  The submissions will be very helpful to us when we get to Second and Committee Stages.  I am very old fashioned.  I happen to think that the less money is involved in politics, the better, particularly the less money is involved in political advertising.  Deputy Paul Murphy and I have been the cheapest Deputies in the current and the last D&aacute;il, coming in at about one third of our allocated expenditure.  I have always thought there should be significantly longer periods for the regulation of expenditure by electoral candidates.  The idea that it is only the money we spend in a three or four-week period is crazy when one can front-load all one's expenditure in the months before that, so I certainly appreciate some of what Ms Carolan is saying.<\/p> <p>  My questions follow on directly from the point Ms Carolan just made.  I will pull out three strands.  For example, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland strongly recommends that there should be broadly the same types of regulations for all different media platforms.  As Ms Carolan rightly referenced, the ICCL talks about the need for a distinction between elections and electoral actors and broader issue-based campaigning etc.  While Ms Carolan is obviously talking about the need for online participation, there seems to be a suggestion that her proposals at the end might under certain circumstances have a certain degree of tension with the ICCL.  I want to tease that out.  Am I misunderstanding that?  Is is more that Ms Carolan is calling for greater transparency rather than greater restrictions for the non-electoral element of the regulation?  Could she tease that out?  <\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the key bolded bullet point in Ms Carolan's conclusion.  If something is not in a Bill, it does not happen.  Therefore, for those of us who would like to take up the points Ms Carolan is raising and make the case for them to be included in the Bill, could she talk about what she would like to see in the Bill that would give effect to her key recommendation in the third last paragraph of her submission?  How would it enforce standards?  What kinds of principles would apply and how can the institution be empowered through the legislation to be able to deal with that evolving set of circumstances?<\/p><p>That would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#C01100","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>I will start with the point relating to the ICCL.  I know that the issue that the consortium has been pushing for quite some time is that the essential activity civil society engages in has been classified as political, which can have an impact on its ability to receive funding.  It takes very serious issue with the definition of issue-based advertising falling under the same realm as electioneering.  I am happy to share an initial piece of work with the committee that is coming out of a consortium with which we are involved across Europe and which is looking at whether all advertising should, by default, be transparent and that what we should be looking at is blanket provisions around transparency in advertising and then restrictions for electoral advertising.  The question is whether we should have a separate category for the need for transparency around issue-based content as opposed to electioneering content.  I am in agreement with the ICCL on that front.<br\/><br\/>In terms of what the recommendation could look like in concrete terms, I guess this goes to the Deputy's point about the broadcasting regulations as well.  As matters stand, the default when new technology is introduced into our online domain is permission.  If we think of analogies, for example, in environmental regulation, we use the precautionary principle which is where we say one cannot dump chemicals into the river and if the fish die then we will start to regulate.  We say that instead we need to think proactively about the implications of new technology being introduced, in that instance it is in the environmental area, but when it comes to our discourse and to how political discourse takes place.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy McAuliffe's point on whether we wait for the perfect legislation, as it stands, the Bill is 300 pages.  It gets into quite excruciating detail around political advertising, nearly to the extent of what the comma-separated values, or CSV, file should look like when the data are published, but there is no mention of voter suppression and having an institution that has responsibilities and a mission to protect both our electoral integrity and, by extension, our national security and giving it powers to apply a set of values on what our electoral system should look like.  For example, we were able to introduce the laws that we have around broadcast because the evolution of broadcast was slow enough for us to do so.  They were an application of a principle that we have in our legislation, which is that nobody should be able to use the expenditure of money in order to dominate.  We looked at TV advertising and we said that is too powerful, we are not going to allow that.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the fact that legislation cannot keep up, we have basically introduced video ads by proxy.  We now have attack ads.  One can pay to attack one's rival and say whatever one likes.  We are chasing our tails on this legislation a little bit.  We are trying to close the stable door.  It will require us to take a step back and think about what the structure of an institution which is capable of regulating and protecting electoral integrity in the 21st century looks like.  I do not think it looks like the institution that this Bill would create.  I think it has to be one which is a genuinely empowered institution to which we say these are the three or five things that we care about in our democracy and we will empower it and give it the research function to be able to assess what is happening.<br\/><br\/>In 2016, I was speaking in the United States at a big gathering of representatives from electoral commissions from all over the world who were discussing what was happening in terms of the evolution of threats, but there was nobody from Ireland in the room.  Everybody was there, namely, the Americans, the British and people from Indonesia, Sierra Leone and Mexico.  They were figuring out and discussing how we protect elections but nobody from Ireland was there.  When we were doing the project on the referendum which was looking at ads, we found international organisations directly targeting Irish voters to try and influence what was happening.  I spoke to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and I even ended up in the Phoenix Park speaking to the security services after the election just to try to find out whose responsibility it is.  In the end it was Facebook and Google that took proactive measures as private companies.  I do not want our electoral rules to be set by default in Palo Alto.  In the United States, the Supreme Court has said that unlimited expenditure by private corporations to influence the outcome of a referendum is constitutionally protected free speech, whether it is Buckley <i>v<\/i>. Valeo, Citizens United v. FEC or whatever.  I have made my point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Carolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>The point has been well made.

It is easy to say that this is the most important legislation that will come before the committee, but I believe that it is because having a secure, comprehensive and accurate electoral register is fundamental to democracy and that without it, we are at nothing.  The current register is wholly inadequate.  I have beside me a portion of the 120 letters that were returned to me by An Post, marked \"Gone away\", \"Not known at this address\" or \"Deceased\" for a section of my constituency in west Waterford when I sent a circular and a piece of information.  That is unacceptable.  It says that something is seriously wrong with the register.  I do not believe that it can be fixed without utilising PPS numbers.  That comes back to the point on which Deputy McAuliffe asked Mr. Sunderland whether the Data Protection Commission has a view.  In 2008, the then commissioner gave evidence to the equivalent of our committee and said that in order to overcome legal obstacles to using PPS numbers or other data held by State agencies to identify electors, the Oireachtas could either seek voluntary consent of electors to use PPS numbers or other data from State agencies for the purpose of compiling the electoral register or legislate to overrule the right of privacy in the interests of the common good, that is, in the interests of enhancing the integrity of the register of electors.  My question is whether that is still the view of the Data Protection Commission.  I believe having an accurate register with integrity is essential to democracy and it must include the use of PPS numbers.  I would appreciate comments on that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the transparency provisions raised by Ms Carolan, does she share the view that it is essential that we introduce a system whereby advertising spend on behalf of parties or individuals by others on platforms like Facebook is accounted for on the account of the individual or party?  If I go into the Facebook ad library at the moment, if somebody was spending money on my behalf that does not show on my account.  It is on the account of some unknown individual who has placed ads on my behalf.  Is it her view that it is essential in this legislation and in other legislation that in looking at the transparency period, those individuals are identified, and that the advertising spend is tagged on to the individual or the party in question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#D00400","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  I note the reference to the previous commissioner's appearance before a previous committee.  In essence, the comments made around legislating for the use of the personal public service number, PPSN, still stand and, indeed, that is what this proposed Bill seeks to achieve.  The comments made at that time still stand and are valid and relevant.  That is what the proposed Bill seeks to achieve.  There is no issue there.  The Bill will set down a legislative basis that is quite clear.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly reply to the comment around consent.  It is probably not a very good lawful basis for collection of personal data in a context such as this because consent is a free choice and the general data protection regulation, GDPR, sets down clear rules around the use of consent.  For the purposes of this process and reforming the electoral register, consent is not an appropriate lawful basis.  The Oireachtas, therefore, may be asked to legislate, which is appropriate.  The issue we have raised is not whether there is a problem with using the PPSN <i>per se<\/i>, we are just saying the process should be set out clearly.  It then falls back on the Department to ask what is the problem with the current registers that it is trying to solve, what is it trying to achieve and how best can it achieve that.  It must work through that process and ask if the PPSN is the best way to sort out the problems with the current registers.  The Department says it is, and may well be right, but our view is that it should set out clearly and publicly, in the interests of transparency, the proportionate and necessary justification for the use of the PPSN.  It is a sensitive piece of information that is increasingly being used in all facets of Irish life in terms of engagement between the public and the State.  It is important for that to be set out clearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Sunderland believe that it is proportionate in the interests of the integrity of having a secure, comprehensive and accurate register?

If that is worked through in a systematic and clear way, and if the answer is the PPSN and that decision is well justified, then there is no issue from a data protection perspective.  Someone could suggest an alternative identifier or another system, look at the alternatives and decide they are not valid, but it is not for the commission to work through that analysis.  That is the responsibility of the Department and it acknowledges that.<\/p> <p>  As I have already mentioned, the PPSN has been legislated in other ways in the past, beyond the Social Welfare Acts, including in the Credit Reporting Act in 2013 and the central credit register, as well as the Health Identifiers Act, where the individual health identifier, a unique identity for individuals, is created off the back of the public services data set.  This can be done.  All we are saying is that the Department must clearly set out the analysis and justify the use of the PPSN in a way that complies with data protection.  This flows from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and long-standing case law of the European Court of Justice.  There is a process that must be gone through, rather than simply saying that we have a problem and we all think the solution is the PPSN.  Rather, it is about asking why we think that is the case.  That is all the commission is saying and if that justification is made, the requirements around data protection have been met.

Data went out from the Department recently about a new road to check out areas and tell people in that area that they are on a route.  Under GDPR, the Department could not send a letter to each of the individual houses but instead had to send them out in a flier system.  It meant that only 10% of the people got the fliers because of the restrictions under GDPR.  I agree that we need an accurate register.  In rural areas, where townlands swap over, people often get a different vote in each individual area.  People often get voting cards addressed to two or three individual areas because there are different townlands.  The only way of calculating this properly and getting people onto a national register is by using their PPSN because that ensures one person, one vote.  Deceased people are still receiving voting cards.  Other people are not being put on registers because census takers cannot access properties and are missing half of the data.  The first thing a young person gets is his or her PPSN.  It is an accurate account of who someone is and records whether they are living in the country or county.  It is an accurate account and a way of making a register that is 100% foolproof accurate.  It is also a way of showing that someone is in the country at the time of an election, unless there are alternative ways of doing it.  To get a register that is 100% foolproof, using the PPSN is the only way forward.<\/p> <p>  On advertising and the platforms for advertising, we can all see what can happen with advertising when it is used in the right way and the wrong way.  It can do damage to certain people, whether it is true or false.

I will also address Senator Cummins's point about the archive that, say, Facebook and Google have at the moment.  It sometimes feels to me as if the people who are trying to do the right thing, fill out all the forms and give their phone numbers and all those kinds of things are the ones who end up in the archive.  They then see quite a lot of other activity and they do not know from where it is coming.  It can be spreading misinformation or connected to someone else and that is not being captured.  That is why we need transparency provisions, at a minimum, across all the advertising.  That way, we can see it all and journalists can dive into it so that we have a sense of what is going on.<\/p> <p>  To reply to a specific point made by the Senator, Facebook's advertising archive was built for the US and its laws where a group can be financed to support a candidate's election campaign and that does not count towards the candidate's spending limits because there are none, or they work differently.  That archive has not been designed for Ireland and its laws.  We should require those platforms to give us all the information that we need, including who is spending money, how much is being spent, what people are saying, where they are saying it and who they are saying it to.  We need to ensure that our electoral commission is able to look at that information.  It can then assess that against the spending limits and identify that, for example, there are five different campaigns going on for one particular candidate and that goes above the limit.  The electoral commission needs to have the power to be able to do that and the platforms need to release the information to allow that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Carolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carolan, Mr. Sunderland and Mr. Murphy for their statements and contributions.<\/p><p>Ms Carolan mentioned the critical point about how the Bill should tackle the issue of information operations and the threat of international interference in political campaigns, which was evident during the 2016 US elections.

No one is responsible.  SIPO has responsibility for ensuring that campaigns do not receive funding from outside the jurisdiction unless it is from citizens located overseas.  For self-funded campaigns or operations that are happening online, though, SIPO has no remit.  I asked it whether it could do anything, but it could not.<\/p> <p>  As a minimum, the first step is to have a statutory body that has responsibility for ensuring that our elections are free from international interference, which is not the case currently.  It would be a complex job and would require the statutory body to be able to stay abreast of developments in international operations.  Many of the major online platforms want to operate within the law of the land.  If that law does not say that international interference is illegal, they cannot act even when we find something.  That is what we saw in 2018.  Facebook and Google prevented overseas groups from purchasing advertisements during the referendum on the eighth amendment because there was ambiguity about some advertisements that were boosting posts by Irish groups, which could have fallen under the provisions relating to illicit overseas funding of third party campaigns in Ireland.  That was the slightly tortuous route that they were able to find to ensure that the actions they took were compliant with Irish law.  The fact that international interference is not illegal currently and no body has responsibility in this regard prevents us from getting private sector actors to take action.  They do not like taking action that is not compelled by or, at least, in line with national legislation.

Is she saying that the Bill, as drafted, will not protect our elections and referendums from serious and malign international influence and that substantial changes to that section are necessary?  Is she making the point that the commission will need to be able to analyse, assess and act in real time?<\/p> <p>  I wish to explore this matter further.  Ms Carolan stated that the precautionary principle was a good model to follow in this context, in that the commission would be able to act to prevent harm before the end of an election or referendum period.  There is limited use in having all of the analysis and deciding we should have done this or that only after external influence has been exerted.  What sorts of power should the commission have if it is to act?  Should it be able to act outside the electoral period?  Should it be able to prohibit spending or certain forms of online activity?  Should it be able to stop misinformation campaigns?  If the legislation gives it the power to act in real time under the precautionary principle, I presume that there will have to be some definitions around that.  The commission could not have unlimited powers.

It will prevent overseas groups from directly purchasing advertising targeting Irish voters because it will place a legal obligation on platforms to carry out due diligence in respect of people who are purchasing political advertisements.  Beyond that, however, I cannot find anything else in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Many information operations focus on voter suppression, which takes the form of fake voter boycott campaigns that are targeted at particular groups.  We saw such campaigns used against African Americans in the US.  It was claimed that, because some people they did not like Hilary Clinton or Donald Trump, they would vote for no one even though we know that there was a 90% chance African Americans were going to vote for Democrats.  That was effectively a voter suppression campaign and was run out of Moscow, as far as the intelligence services can tell.  We have an element of complacency in Ireland in this regard.  Where a Border poll or future vote on EU constitutional issues is concerned, we are at serious risk.  We would be slightly less at risk with this Bill, but we would not be fully there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how to ensure that a body like the one outlined in the Bill was accountable so that it did not just change the rules halfway through an electoral period.  That is a difficult thing to ensure and I do not envy the legislative drafters who must try to sort out that puzzle.  Speaking as a political scientist rather than a lawyer or legislative draftsperson, the best approach is to have a tightly defined set of outcomes that we want the electoral commission to achieve, a defined set of powers to be able to achieve them, and proper checks and balances, for example, a requirement for setting rules six months before an election based on an assessment of the latest developments in campaign technology.  Those rules would then have to go before a committee like this one or some other accountable body.  It would be important for the commission to have the statutory power to compel private companies to take certain actions, in particular around transparency measures.  Outside the realm of hate speech or other such concepts, it is dangerous to give anyone the power to compel the taking down or removal of content from a freedom of expression point of view, but the commission should be able to go to a company that has a new product it had not anticipated and tell the company that, at a minimum, it must publish information on who is giving it money, who is spending, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Carolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carolan.

That should be done now, at this drafting stage.  It is important for that process to continue prior to the Government signing off on the final text of the Bill.  That can be done at this stage.  Issues around personal public service numbers, PPSN, other risks around the national register, how it will interface with the local registers, the registering authority etc. can all be dealt with.

That person was given responsibility for ensuring that the institution was functioning well.<\/p> <p>  What expertise will the body have?  I think this will require the body to be able to hire from outside the Civil Service.  It may have to be able to hire in people with specific expertise, in particular if there is a research function and a body responsible for ensuring that there can be threat protection.  There may need to be some of that agility.  We will need people who are literate in those areas or who, at a minimum, know the people who are literate in those areas.<\/p> <p>  How do we get away from the static design?  This is the big question that I spend much of my time thinking about.  It is well worth getting people who are experts in institutional design to help us to figure this out.  Some of the examples I have heard about are in the area of environmental protection.  I know the Environmental Protection Agency has three functions.  One involves a public information division.  There is a research function and another part implements legislation.  We do not write legislation for every new potential environmental threat.  We build bodies that are capable of responding in dynamic ways.  The shift in drug policy in the past ten years has been interesting as well.  We do not ban every substance.  Instead, we think about the outcomes we want to see and how to build bodies.<\/p> <p>  The question is particularly difficult when it comes to elections because in a way there are many turkeys voting for Christmas if we think about some of the standard accountability structures where our elected representatives are also candidates.  However, I believe we have to pursue this and think about that question.  Otherwise we will end up struggling as our European counterparts are at the moment.  We want to avoid struggling in two to five years' time to adapt an institution that was built for a different age.

One will note in those provisions there is this issue of registration, etc.  What is particularly important is that paragraph 19, page 3, of the deputy commissioner's submission to the committee today states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is noted that the establishment of a list of pending electors will require the processing of the personal data of children.  The DPC has advised the Department [I would be interested in that advice] to take account of our recently published draft guidance titled, Children Front and Centre: Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing.  <\/blockquote> <p>This is of serious concern.  I would like the deputy commissioner to tell the committee the main recommendations of that document because I think they are important.  It is a particularly sensitive area, and one we must be cognisant of in relation to this proposed legislation.  I will give my time to the deputy commissioner to tease out and explain to the committee some of the fundamentals.  I read some of this document today but I would like the deputy commissioner to set out his understanding of it.  The centrality of that document is particularly important as part of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#J00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his questions.  The Senator raises an important point.  It is tangentially addressed in this proposed Bill on the registration of pending electors.<\/p> <p>  To give the Senator some brief background, late last year the Data Protection Commission published draft guidance around the protection of children's personal data - Children Front and Centre: Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing.  That is out for public consultation at present until the end of this month.  In large part, it looks at online platforms, as one would expect given that we are the lead supervisory authority for many of the giant technology firms, but in all contexts of the processing of children it sets down fundamental requirements.  The General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, calls out children as a special subset of individuals which deserve the highest protections of standards of data protection and we acknowledge in our guidance that under the age of 18 is the age at which a person is determined as a child in line with the definition of a child under the UN Convention on Human Rights of the Child.  Given that the registration of pending electors will involve the crossing of personal data of children, that is, persons under the age of 18, we advised, as the Senator states, the Department that it should consider our draft guidance and to look and see which elements of that might apply.<\/p> <p>  Of particular relevance to this registration process is a recommendation that in implementing the legislation there would be an audience-aware approach to the provision of clear and targeted information.  The legislation, in a sense, probably is what it is.  It is a question as to whether further evolving of that in the drafting is required but what is of critical importance will be the implementation of that provision.  I understand, from the heads of the Bill, that the registration of pending electors would be done on the basis of applications by maybe 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, and that the Department has talked about running certain programmes to involve children in the electoral process to get them engaged.  Those are all public policy imperatives, but what we are calling out is that one must remember where the processing of personal data arises that one is dealing with children and, therefore, the information should be targeted in a way that is appropriate to their age.  It applies to adults, but most particularly applies to children, and must be concise, transparent, intelligible and accessible.<\/p> <p>  It is also to make the point as well that we suggested a data protection impact assessment - I mention it again - should be carried out for this specific cohort of persons and address any additional safeguards that might be needed.  I do not have a deep insight into what they might be at this stage other than, I suppose, a general warning that when one is processing specifically the personal data of children it is important that any risk to their rights is identified and addressed.<\/p> <p>  Further on, there is also potentially the issue of their rights under the GDPR and the different rights that may apply, such as the right of access.  In the implementation of these provisions there would need to be deep thought around how that would apply because, in some cases, parents may, for example, submit an access request on behalf of a child.  At that age, the child has probably reached an age of maturity where he or she should be able to exercise his or her own data protection rights, but it is a sliding scale.  I am probably going a little off point.<\/p> <p>  Our core point in raising that was that the Department would be aware it will be processing children's data in a specific context, albeit at the request of the child.  The core issue for us is around the transparency of the information to the cohort of people, clearly explaining what it means to engage in this way of putting one's details on the electoral register before one turns 18.  I will say straight up that there may not be extensive risks but it is important that there be a specific focus on the matter to identify and mitigate any risks that are there to the rights of the children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sunderland.

I completely agree with him, in terms of a methodology and a practice to assert and to establish, but can he go back to the question I heard one of the other committee members ask earlier?  It seems counter-intuitive that these data impact assessments would be done after we have enacted legislation, particularly as it relates to the register of electors.  The integrity and the accuracy of the register of electors is fundamental to any chance of our democracy being an effective democracy.<\/p><p>Can the witnesses talk about that?  I have an intuitive concern, which is not based on any great expertise, around the proposal to have a central database and, for a period of time, a parallel local authority-administered register of electors.  At base, before we embark upon creating any sort of new centralised database there should be some sort of audit of the integrity of the existing database and register and a data protection impact assessment undertaken on what is being proposed.<\/p><p> I congratulate Ms Carolan on her baby.

That is why the Department is undertaking a data protection impact assessment of the project as a whole and all of the key elements.<\/p> <p>  We would certainly be of the very strong view that before the provisions of the Bill are finalised a very detailed data protection impact assessment should be conducted of all of the main elements of the Bill which involve the processing of personal data.

I refer to marketing or public relations campaigns being manipulated in the guise of unsolicited comments or a proliferation of views and opinions being used to give the impression that a particular opinion is supported.

Do we have an entity that is doing that?  <\/p><p> I am concerned to hear Ms Carolan say we are seen to be thought leaders when it comes to this legislation because, for me, there is a massive gap in it in that our society has changed fundamentally because of social media and we have not caught up with it.  We are not even aware of the extent to which our daily lives are influenced by social media and we have become so used and addicted to the convenience and connection of it that we do not realise how much we are being influenced and changed and our very thinking is being augmented without us knowing it.  I am interested in knowing how the artificial intelligence, AI, works and how the community standards are being applied.  Who is the overseer in that regard?  The term \"political advertising\" as defined or inferred in the Bill is too narrow.  It is too short a space of time, in my view.  That section of the legislation, in my view, is not fit for purpose and is not forward-thinking enough.  <\/p><p> I see some sort of interplay here for, perhaps, a social media commissioner.  I have looked closely at the media commission.  All that is proposed there is fantastic for a specific purpose.  The Data Protection Commission too is fantastic.  I am a big fan.  I am always very proud of Helen Dixon when she is speaking at international events and of how much we lead on this, but it is a fixed purpose also.  The electoral commission will have a very confined purpose as well.  How do we take the three elements of those that need to come together such that we can oversee that our whole way of thinking is being influenced and changed all of the time on platforms and yet we are unaware of it?  How will that be managed, still allowing for freedom of expression but at the same time dealing with the phenomenon of disinformation?  I could speak for hours but I will stop now otherwise there will be no time for answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#K00700","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Carolan to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#L00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>I would love to solve all of those problems.

The European Democracy Action Plan and other initiatives are looking at that broader picture.  If we try to move too far beyond influence on electoral processes not only will we get ourselves into trouble, but we could end up discrediting the electoral commission if it ends up getting into arguments and fights about, for example, health disinformation, as mentioned earlier.

As new technology evolves, having that written into legislation will be important.  We can shame individuals who run the large companies but in five or ten years that may not be Facebook and Google.

I thank the Senator for her questions and her comments about the Data Protection Commission.  We do not have many fans.  I am delighted the Senator is a fan.  She mentioned that GDPR is often used as a reason for not doing things which, to be honest, very much irritates us because that is a deflection from the purpose of data protection.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned the platforms and raised a very valid point about the role of regulators.  The Data Protection Commission is only responsible for regulating the use and processing of personal data.  In regard to online content and moderation of content, including illegal content and harmful content, that is another sphere entirely in which the Data Protection Commission is not involved.  The gap and lacuna that leaves is a matter beyond the Data Protection Commission, but is a fair comment.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the platforms, the Senator is correct that they vary in terms of their lawful basis processing under Article 6 of the GDPR.  Some of them rely on contract and others rely on consent.  There are a lot of complexities there but on that point I would point out that we have a number of ongoing inquiries looking at the lawful basis on which the online platforms process personal data in the context of a user signing up.  One of those, which we reference in our recently published annual report, is in relation to Facebook and its reliance on the lawful basis for processing.  <\/p> <p>  The issue around community standard is separate to data protection.  It includes data protection but it is more large-scale than that.  It is about all the issues around online content and what they allow on their platforms but there is a nexus at certain points.  Where they are introducing new types of data processing or changing the way in which they do things, the platforms have to undertake a screening to see if there is a high risk to the data protection rights of individuals.  Where they identify a high risk - I would imagine anything to do with processing around elections may fall into this space - they have to do a data protection impact assessment.  Even if they are not required to do a data protection impact assessment, there are other obligations they must comply with, including the principles of data protection such as that the processing is fair, lawful and transparent and they only use data for the purposes for which it was collected and so on.  It is really complex in terms of these platforms and the way they are structured.  However, these are issues the Data Protection Commission is incrementally looking at as we work through our various inquiries and in other areas such as our supervisory function where we engage with the platforms on a regular basis around new products and services.<\/p><p>Members might have heard last year the example of Facebook dating and how the Data Protection Commission intervened in the process to review the data protection impact assessment.  It secured changes on the back of that in terms of transparency for individuals regarding how data would be used in Facebook dating, for example.  All those changes helped in making recommendations to Facebook to make sure it was compliant.<\/p><p> In this space, online advertising is obviously a big issue.  We have open inquiries into how the online ad tech system works.  There is an inquiry into the Google Authorized Buyer organisation and another into an organisation called Quantcast.  This is all looking into and teasing through all the things that happen in the background concerning how data are collected in online and offline contexts, how they are merged and how they are resurfaced to determine what advertisements members and I might see, depending on how we browse or what we like online.  All of that is very much in play at the moment.  It is not the answer to all of these issues but it certainly has a part to play in the overall picture of working out what compliance means under GDPR and the standard expected under GDPR.  That work is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sunderland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021032300002#M00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>I wish to follow on from the previous contribution.  When we focus on advertising in the digital environment we are kind of ignoring the elephant in the room.  The Internet is on 24-7 and it is available in the palms of everybody's hands.  It is the corrupting and corrosive effect of digital influencing on our democracy that we need to be trying to tackle.  We need to try to protect the democratic process.  We need to be realistic about the levels of control that can be exercised but, at a minimum, we should be exposing the very tenuous relationship that some political actors have with the truth.  Does the delegation agree that if we are to invest in an electoral commission to try to protect the democratic value of our electoral activities, its remit should really cover monitoring, examining and reporting beyond the election cycle?  The reality is that influencing is occurring increasingly outside the election cycle and not through advertisements.  Every other form of digital communication is being used.

Our existing electoral laws have three values that we care about.  The first is that we limit money, the second is that we limit the franchise, and the third is that we demand openness, traceability and scrutiny in political campaigns.  We do not live in a world where we can apply that for the eight or 12 weeks before an election, nor do we live in a world where we have X number of political parties and some Independents who are the only actors participating in the run-up to elections, never mind referendum campaigns.  What the electoral commission could do, at a minimum, is enforce the openness and traceability piece in online discussions that happen all the time.  I am referring to transparency not only in political advertising but also in all other advertising.  There are many grey areas.  For example, if one is selling feminist T-shirts, does that count as political activity or commercial activity?  One can get into very murky territory.  The more one imposes limits, however, the more one is just penalising the good actors and then keeping the bad actors and their activities hidden.  I would like to see the electoral commission having a mandate and the ability to enforce openness and transparency on platforms.  We cannot rely on their goodwill, especially when we do not know what the next big thing is going to be, or the big thing after that.<\/p> <p>  Advertisements are an issue because they are about money and financial transactions.  This is something we regulate.  The Internet is toxic; it is awful.  It is an awful place.  We need to be investing in public service broadcasting because we know that matters.  It matters that people have reliable sources of information to counter bad information.  If one spends too much time focusing on how to deal with the bad information and not enough on how to counter it with good-quality information, it is an issue.  There are a few organisations internationally, such as First Draft and Data &amp;amp; Society, that have done some really good research on this.

Let me end on a positive note because a lot of this is about regulating and dealing with the negative stuff, the social media and material on the Internet.  It is important to emphasise that the Internet, as well as being a toxic place at times, is a very strong, powerful and empowering place, which is why we all use it in our work to promote our activity.  It gives people access to large volumes of good information that they would not otherwise have access to.  We need to balance those things.  I remind people that if they want a lot of disinformation, they should not go to the Internet but sit in the D&aacute;il Chamber for a few days.  They will hear a lot there.

There is no way to design the perfect advertisement archive that is going to fit with regulations that are popping up in over 200 countries.  I am not entirely sure of the answer.

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as do witnesses physically present.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For members who are participating remotely, I ask them to keep their device on mute until they are invited to speak.  When they are speaking I ask that where possible, they have their camera switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.  In addition, I would like to remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in this meeting from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be refused.<\/p> <p>  I will invite each organisation in turn to make an opening statement to a maximum of five minutes because we only have a two-hour window for the meeting.  Once all of the opening statements have been delivered, I will then call on the members of the committee, in the order that they indicate to me, to put their questions.  In the time remaining, there will be an opportunity for members to ask supplementary questions.  I ask attendees to note that the duration of the meeting is limited, therefore the times must be strictly adhered to.  I ask everyone to be focused in their contributions.  There is a time clock to ensure that we do that.<\/p> <p>  I now call on each organisation to make its opening statement in the following order: RCNI, Men's Aid, One in Four, the Bar of Ireland and the Department of Justice.

We would like to take acknowledge Government&rsquo;s commitment to full implementation of the O&rsquo;Malley review recommendations and the significant progress made so far.  RCNI also acknowledges recent positive changes introduced by other agencies, for instance, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This opening statement will summarise the main points of our submission and address a small number of specific issues.<br\/><br\/>Victims&rsquo; testimony is a key component of an effective criminal justice process.  The pursuit of excellence in all contacts with victims of sexual offences by relevant professionals must be a key principle, both to minimise the risks of re-traumatisation of victims by the criminal justice process and to ensure that they are supported to give their best evidence in that process.  The harm which can be caused by the criminal justice system itself to victims is real, and is sometimes described by them as worse than the sexual violence itself.  <br\/><br\/>Victims of sexual violence should be seen as inherently vulnerable witnesses, Of these, some are additionally vulnerable, for example because of their young age or because of a disability, and all victims should be seen as individuals in need of individual supports.  Many aspects of the criminal justice system can pose challenges for victims of sexual offences from the very beginning.  These include a lack of access to legal advice, an inability to contact investigators, a lack of personal support, endless delays at each stage of the process itself, fears for their personal safety and privacy throughout the process and last but by no means least, fear of being subjected to lengthy and oppressive cross-examination on their private lives, going well beyond the facts of the offence itself.  Good care of sexual violence victims begins from the moment that an offence is communicated, is multifaceted, takes account of individual needs, continues to the end of any trial and beyond, and involves effective collaboration between statutory agencies and NGOs.<br\/><br\/>Lengthy delays are not only re-traumatising in themselves but affect the quality of victims&rsquo; memories.  The primacy of oral evidence in our criminal justice system is at odds with modern psychological science.  This is now recognised elsewhere.  As the Scottish judge, Lord Carloway, put it, &quot;a person&rsquo;s memory does not improve over time or being put under stress&quot;.  For example, we could mitigate the negative effects on memory of lengthy delays between offence and trial by allowing at least the most vulnerable witnesses, namely, children and those with a &quot;mental disorder&quot; or communication difficulty, to have their entire evidence prerecorded and allowed to stand as their evidence at trial - not just as at present, their prerecorded evidence-in-chief.  We could also allow any victim of sexual violence who wishes to do this to have their evidence-in-chief prerecorded and stand as their evidence at trial.<br\/><br\/>Access to special measures at court is difficult.  Special measures remain hard to access in court for many victims of sexual violence who are neither children nor have a mental disorder.  RCNI recommends that the current legislative framework is simplified and streamlined so that a presumption in favour of access to special measures is created for any victim of, or witness to, sexual violence.  Serious consideration should be given to introducing special measures for accused persons, in order that the present legal culture, which is inclined to view special measures for victims as intrinsically unfair to the accused, will cease to see these measures as a threat to defence interests.  The twin aims of improving supports for vulnerable witnesses and achieving a fair trial for the accused should not be seen as mutually exclusive.  Any new legislative framework should include wide-ranging judicial powers to allow the introduction of any novel, individually tailored special measure<b><\/b>to assist a vulnerable witness to give evidence, provided that is not contrary to the interests of justice.  It should also address the gaps in the use of intermediaries<b><\/b>in our current legislation, that is, the use of intermediaries should extend to the witness&rsquo;s answers and should include witnesses whose mental condition is fine and who do not have a mental disorder but do have a communications difficulty.<br\/><br\/>Beyond special measures, our long-standing view is that any victim of sexual violence who needs it, should have access to support from a dedicated, professional advocacy and support worker from their first contact with either an NGO or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our vision is a national network of professional advocacy and support workers to provide practical and emotional support, referrals, accompaniment services and links to other sources of information, advice and support, and whose role is distinct from that of legal advisers or specialist counsellors.  For all the measures we have suggested which are already in hand, RCNI stresses that enough resources, including judges, must be provided if it is to succeed as it should.  These resources should include access to appropriate training which challenges, head-on, the many pervasive rape myths on which much defence cross-examination is still based, in part, by pointing out that as they are not based on fact but on prejudice and misogyny, they are irrelevant to the issues in the case.  However, RCNI also recognises that rape myths need to be identified and rooted out through education and awareness-raising initiatives.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to do my best to answer any questions on this opening statement and on the general issue of victims&rsquo; testimony.

They feel the crime is not classed as rape in law because of their gender.  Our clients are aged between 18 and 83 years of age.  These sons, brothers and dads come from all walks of life, and they include male Travellers, the LGBT community, farmers, those in direct provision, foreign nationals and men with disabilities.  They are from a wide and varied background, from carpenters to chief executives.  We know intimate partner violence does not discriminate.<\/p> <p>  We will address the question of rape myths.  Little is known about the needs of men experiencing partner sexual violence.  These men in the main suffer in silence as it remains difficult for society to accept that women can also be and are perpetrators of violence.  In 2020, our service supported approximately 5,500 contacts.  Of these, 13 brave men disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted, 11 by a female partner and two by a male partner.  Two men disclosed that they had been raped by female partners.  In January 2021, we supported 557 contacts to our service.  One of the calls was from a man who disclosed having non-consensual sexual activity.  In his words, he had been raped by his wife.  This man, who is a dad in his 50s, took the brave step and with our support reported the rape to our colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who are now investigating so I cannot say anything further about the case.<\/p> <p>  Our colleagues in the UK are more advanced in the context of this issue.  Dr. Siobhan Weare of Lancaster University law school is the expert in this field of men who report being raped by a female.  The term used is FTP, or forced to penetrate.  In 2020, we supported an 18-year-old boy who reported that his mum and sister were sexually assaulting him.  His phone was taken from him at times so he started to communicate with us via email from his local library.  His emails were heartbreaking to read.  He wrote about his hope of getting a good leaving certificate and college being his escape and a safe place.  Too old for a referral to Tusla and too scared to speak to garda&iacute;, there was nowhere for this vulnerable victim to go as there is no refuge in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Currently, Irish legislation does not recognise that a male can be raped by a female.  The Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 does not recognise or label FTP.  US data indicates that approximately one in 21 men reported they were raped or forced to penetrate by someone else during their lifetime.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of consequences and impact.  The harm of partner violence is catastrophic to the victim&rsquo;s life.  The impact on mental health, flashbacks, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide ideation and feelings of shame, guilt and anger.  The increase in suicide ideation reported to our helpline weekly is increasing at a significant rate.<\/p> <p>  We ask the joint committee to reflect on our presentation and we make the following requests.  We call for law reform and legislation to acknowledge that men experience rape and sexual assault from a male and female; increased front-line and wraparound resources to support male victims of partner violence; and academic research in the area so we can grasp a better understanding of men experiencing sexual assault and rape by male and female partners.<\/p> <p>  I recognise that this is a new area for Ireland but it is our reality.  Given the limited levels of data in the area of men experiencing rape by a female partner, I reached out to a number of colleagues when writing this presentation.  I thank: Ms Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre; Dr. Siobhan Weare of Lancaster University; Mr. Duncan Craig, chief executive of Survivors Manchester; Mr. Mark Brooks, chair of  Mankind UK; and Ms Rhonda Lusty, chief executive of Men&rsquo;s Advisory Project in Northern Ireland.  It is imperative that we widen the circle and engage with experts who are ahead of us as we work towards supporting men and boys who are victims of sexual assault and rape.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathrina Bentley"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for coming before us and for the presentation.

I am the deputy chief executive of One in Four and my colleague, Ms Maeve Lewis, is also in attendance.  I have no doubt everybody here today has a common objective to improve the experience of vulnerable witnesses in our courts.  One in Four welcomes the commitment of the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice and her Department, and the work done on implementing the important recommendations made in the O'Malley report.  There will be other valuable recommendations made here today but I want to shed light on an aspect of this issue that is often overlooked.<\/p> <p>  I would like the members to take a moment to think about what it might be like to describe to a room like this the intimate details of a positive sexual relationship.  Now think about what that might be like if that sexual encounter had been terrifying.  The criminal justice system is relied on by survivors of sexual violence to in part to help them address their traumatic experience.  In reality, we know the real cost to them is re-traumatisation.  The law is applied to the crime, but very little attention is paid to how the system interacts with the personal impact of the crime.<\/p> <p>  One in Four has developed wide experience in assisting survivors negotiate the complex terrain that lies between their personal traumatic experiences of childhood sexual abuse and the legal system.  In 2016 we completed a study entitled Only a Witness, which brought to the forefront the voices of the survivors, as co-researchers, in order to identify their experiences of the criminal justice system and to provide constructive analysis.  Our observations today are based on our expertise and the voices of those who have been through the system.  We hope they may be of some value to the committee deliberations.<\/p> <p>  Trauma is undoubtedly an invisible witness in our courtrooms.  If we are to improve the experience of vulnerable witnesses we need to direct attention to how the system can integrate insights on the impact of trauma.  Sarah from our study stated, \"It was so inhumane.  I never felt the system in any way valued me as much as it valued him - never!\".  There are a variety of experiences that can provoke trauma.  The psychological responses people have to stressful events would be different for everyone.  A person&rsquo;s resilience, their support system, age and history will all influence their responses to the dynamics of trauma.<\/p> <p>  It is clear, however, that for many people the effects of trauma can be severe and debilitating.  This is particularly so in the context of sexual and domestic violence, which happen in a complex relational context characterised by manipulation and abuse of power and trust.  In the context of childhood sexual abuse, the child is subtly drawn into the sexually exploitative relationship, manipulating particular vulnerability, instilling secrecy, fear, feelings of guilt and responsibility in the victim through a process of grooming.  This abuse can have a profound impact on the development of the child and the child has to adapt psychologically in order to survive.  Coping mechanisms for those who experience trauma include: splitting off conscious knowledge of the abuse; dissociation or mentally cutting off during the physical act of abuse; internalising feelings of shame and self-blame; and rationalising and minimising the abuse.<\/p> <p>  Our courts require the witness to give a sworn testimony of traumatic events in an environment that often mirrors the power and authority dynamics of the person's past experiences of sexual abuse.<\/p><p>They become distressed and can only respond in the way they did to the original trauma.  Harvard professor of psychiatry, Judith Herman, remarks that &ldquo;if one set out intentionally to design a system for provoking symptoms of traumatic stress it would look very much like a court of law&quot;.  In our study, Barbara described the ongoing impact of revisiting the initial trauma while giving evidence:<\/p><blockquote>\tI couldn&rsquo;t go up there and give my evidence again.  I just could not do that.  It&rsquo;s one of the most awful things that I had awful trouble with afterward.  I&rsquo;ve gone to counselling and the rest.  They had a booklet of the house where I was born and that house is in ruins now and they have pictures of each of the rooms and the rooms where I was abused.  I&rsquo;m still having trouble getting that out of my head. <\/blockquote><p>Traumatic stress affects a witness&rsquo;s ability to deliver a consistent and credible account, perhaps casting doubt on the reliability of their testimony.  Some people experience flashbacks.  A person can lose all awareness of their present surroundings and live through the trauma as if it was happening again.  Unfortunately, people experiencing a flashback are not always aware what it is.  This is something I and my colleagues regularly witness while supporting survivors in court.  Self-harm is a risk factor rarely mentioned in this context but is a very live issue for One in Four staff when supporting witnesses at court.<br\/><br\/>In order to facilitate witnesses to give the best account of themselves in court, it is important to understand how the trauma is triggered in a court setting or at any point through the process.  In our study, Anne describes her feeling of powerlessness during her cross-examination:<\/p><blockquote>\tAnd so the powerlessness you feel of what happened to you just comes back again.  I mean you&rsquo;re totally powerless in that room, you can&rsquo;t gasp.  You can&rsquo;t go Oh my god, you can&rsquo;t go oh this is terrible.  You have to sit there and be like a stone wall.  Fair enough ... they can&rsquo;t have chaos.  But why the cruelty? <\/blockquote><p>It is for this reason One in Four recommends an impact assessment be carried out on how the court environment and court procedures impact on complainant witnesses in trials of sexual crime.  An impact study of this nature should examine the various interactions witnesses have with the system and its personnel, the likely trigger points for retraumatisation and how these could be mitigated.  We have observed in court how language, tone of voice, the style of questioning and the use of silence are all devices that can either reassure or trigger a traumatic stress response in a witness.  This is an area we feel deserves immediate attention.  In our study, Sarah said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI think overall I was probably on the stand for, give or take, four hours.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how horrific it is being cross-examined.  To this day I can hear that barrister&rsquo;s voice in my ear crystal clear.  It feels like that is never going to leave me and my only saving thing is that I never once looked at him.  ...if I heard his voice today I would know him straight away and it&rsquo;s horrific. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt.

We thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their invitation to us to participate in this public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  Ms Fiona Murphy, SC, who accompanies me on behalf of the Bar, is a member of the Inner Bar who regularly acts, both for the prosecution and the defence, in rape and sexual offence cases and cases involving vulnerable witnesses.  I am a member of the Bar Council and I chair its Criminal and State Bar Committee.  I also am a barrister practising in criminal law.<\/p> <p>  Rape and sexual assault are very serious offences.  Rape offences are in the very small category of criminal offences exclusively tried in the Central Criminal Court.  There are, however, persistent issues with the under-reporting of sexual offences and with prosecution and conviction rates lower than those for other serious offences.  It is important that all areas of criminal law are kept under review to ensure that crimes can be effectively detected and punished.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the area of rape and sexual assault offences is considered in the context of steps that might be taken to improve both the rate of detection and successful prosecution.  It is equally important to ensure that any proposed remedies do not infringe upon the constitutional protections to which accused persons are entitled.<\/p> <p>  Various special measures are available to assist victims and vulnerable witnesses in the giving of evidence and in their interactions with the criminal justice system.  These include measures such as anonymity, the exclusion of the public from the courtroom and the giving of evidence over video link rather than in person.  The use of intermediaries to assist child witnesses has increased in recent years, although their use is made more difficult by there being no registered intermediaries within the State.  Other measures include the provision of a screen to shield the witness from the accused and a restriction, without the court&rsquo;s permission, on questioning a witness about previous sexual experience.  These legislative protections culminate in the protections against secondary and repeat victimisation contained in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.<\/p> <p>  When the issue of being questioned about previous sexual experience arises in a rape case, a victim is entitled to separate legal representation but there is, as yet, no similar entitlement in sexual assault cases.  That anomaly should be remedied.<\/p> <p>  The O&rsquo;Malley report, published last summer, contains many important recommendations that, if implemented, will assist victims and vulnerable witnesses as they navigate their way through the criminal justice system, from the time of their first engagement with garda&iacute; through to the conclusion of the trial process.  The Bar Council welcomed the report on its publication.  It made a submission about the O&rsquo;Malley report last September to the Department of Justice and has been working to develop a training programme, as recommended by the O&rsquo;Malley group, that will enhance the Bar&rsquo;s existing continuing professional development and advanced advocacy courses.<\/p> <p>  It is important to ensure that such special measures as are necessary and appropriate are available to assist witnesses to give their best evidence.  It is also important to ensure that the criminal justice system is sufficiently resourced to protect against delays.  There are delays in the court system caused by too great a backlog of cases, which now extends to 2023.  Delay can also be caused by there being no court available on the day on which cases are listed for trial.  This can cause cases to be adjourned for days or weeks and, in some cases, for many months.  This would be significantly ameliorated by greater judicial and court resources.  Delays can also be caused by issues with disclosure.  Disclosure in criminal trials, particularly with regard to sexual offences, requires a system that is better resourced.<\/p> <p>  The impact of delay can be significant.  First, the closer in time that any trial is to the events giving rise to the charges, the fresher in memory the testimony will be.  Second, there is a psychological impact on victims and witnesses as they ready themselves for trial.  The longer the process, the longer this burden has to be carried.  There is also an impact on victims and witnesses where there is uncertainty over when a trial might commence.  Some of this uncertainty will be alleviated by the introduction of preliminary hearings, which the Bar Council would welcome.  Legislation to allow such hearings is currently before the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the impact that the process can have on victims, in our submission we discuss the impact there can be on practitioners and the dangers of vicarious trauma.  While there has been some limited study of the issue in this country, international studies suggest that it can be a significant risk for those frequently undertaking this kind of work.  All of these issues are discussed in greater detail in the submission previously furnished to the committee and we are happy to assist the committee members as best we can with any questions they might have.  I am grateful for the opportunity to participate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>Thank you.

As my colleague from the Bar Council mentioned, the genesis of the O'Malley Review of Protections for Vulnerable Witnesses in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences was concern about low reporting levels for rape and other sexual assaults and concern as to how victims are treated within the reporting, investigation and trial processes and beyond.  I attended the review group on behalf of the Department and can confirm that the group was entirely committed to putting the victim at the centre of its work.  That focus on the victim and on reforming the criminal justice process to make it as safe and secure as possible for the victim is reflected in every one of the more than 50 recommendations in the report.<\/p> <p>  Among those recommendations, as my colleague mentioned, was the urgent need to introduce preliminary trial hearings in order to reduce delays and to allow for certain matters to be addressed in advance of the trial.  The Criminal Procedure Bill 2021 was drafted as a priority in order to give effect to this recommendation.  The Bill was published before Christmas and has now passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il and will go before the Seanad very shortly.  Preliminary hearings will reduce delays and increase efficiency in how our criminal trials are run.  They will remove some of the uncertainties, we hope, that victims currently face about potential issues arising after the trial has started.  They allow the court to deal with many of the issues that currently require the jury to be excused during the trial, sometimes on multiple occasions.  Victims have spoken about how difficult it is for them when they have mentally prepared for a trial date and the trial does not go ahead and how upsetting and difficult it is if something unexpected is brought up during the trial that results in interruptions while difficulties or legal arguments are dealt with by the court.  While preliminary hearings cannot change the fact that the trial is still an adversarial process, that an accused person is entitled to defend himself or herself robustly and that events can unfold in unexpected ways, their introduction should make trials more predictable and help them run more smoothly.<\/p> <p>  We can also provide strengthened supports for victims, including access to their own legal advice and support throughout the investigation, the trial and beyond in order that they have the information they need to make informed decisions and to understand what is happening and what their choices are at every stage.  As recommended by Tom O'Malley in his review, we are working to extend the current right to legal representation that victims have during an application to question them about their prior sexual history in order that it covers the questioning itself in court.<\/p> <p>  A range of other legislative amendments to the sexual offences legislation arise from Tom O'Malley's recommendations, and the Department is developing the general scheme of a new sexual offences Bill which we expect to complete before the end of the year and which will provide for all those changes.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Briain, who will speak about the implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Carberry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to be here.<\/p> <p>  Once the O'Malley review was published, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, asked the Department to prepare an implementation plan within ten weeks.  The plan, Supporting a Victim's Journey, was published in October 2020.  Delivering on all the agreed actions is a priority for the Department and a personal priority for the Minister.  The most important point to make at this stage is our commitment as a Department to working in partnership with the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, sector to ensure the victim's perspective and voice are at the heart of what we do.  Crucially important physical and emotional supports and services are provided by NGOs, and the reform and development of these services should be progressed in a spirit of co-design between the State as funder and the voluntary sector as provider.  I see in the room today many of the NGO colleagues with whom we work closely in implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey.<\/p> <p>  As to what we have done thus far, we have reviewed our grant schemes for organisations working with victims of crime.  We asked each NGO to identify the precise categories of victims with whom they work, the services they provide and the geographical areas in which they work.  The funding available increased from some &euro;2 million in 2020 to some &euro;4 million this year.  We have allocated most of the 2021 grant moneys but are still analysing the data to see where gaps in service provision remain so we can work to fill them.  We are also offering multi-annual funding commitments to a number of NGOs with which we work most closely and where the funding covers staff salaries.

It was very interesting to read the opening statements prior to today's meeting.  It is very clear this issue needs to be dealt with.  Most of us have come across people who have had difficulties with the court experience.  One of the things I do not think I came across in any of the opening statements is the idea of having somebody there with the victim on the day of the court sitting.  People tell me that on many occasions there may be a garda or a couple of garda&iacute; with whom they have been working through the process but that sometimes they are not there.  The victims then feel they are lost, they have nowhere to go and they are in unfamiliar surroundings.  There could be some practical measure taken to ensure they have somebody who would be with them, coach them, help them and bring them to a safe place when they are not required in the courtroom in order that they know they can have security around all that.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the issue of video evidence and video link being used more and how that can be done.  With Covid we are all getting more used to all this, and indeed here we are today.  I think an awful lot more can be done with these measures.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I wish to raise relates to the statements that are made.  Some of the Garda statements and the initial statements, as we know, are recorded when people go into the interview rooms in Garda stations to make statements.  How and in what measure can these statements be brought to bear more on the trial and the process?  Cross-examination is the big issue, most people find.  When they are in the courtroom and the cross-examination is taking place they get into a really vulnerable state.  There is huge trauma around all that.  How can that be managed and worked better?  I fully accept that in many cases the issue of consent is put forward as the defence.  In that context we will find there is at least some level of discussion of previous sexual activity or the relationship the person may have had with the accused in the past.  We have to acknowledge there is a person accused as well and that he or she is entitled to make a defence.  The key issue here, however, is that the experience of so many people is reflected in the under-reporting of the crime.  So few people come forward and report these crimes.  We should try to ensure we drive this in such a direction that people can make a difference.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to video evidence.<\/p><p>What further actions do we need to take?  Are changes required to ensure video links can be used more?  Are courtrooms equipped for that?  Is it a matter of putting the facilities in place or is it a matter of ensuring we can allow that to happen?  Is that something that has discretionary support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#D00600","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>Who would the Deputy like to answer those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#E00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Bar of Ireland or the Department of Justice would have a view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#E00300","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1212,"content":"<p>I will answer the question about video links.  One of the issues Deputy Kenny raised, which is the answer to this question to a degree, is resources.  Not every courtroom is equipped for video links.  For example, not every courtroom in the Criminal Courts of Justice, which is a very modern building that has been in use for a little over ten years, is equipped to take evidence by way of video link and not every courtroom around the country is able to do so.  The situation is getting better and it has got better over the last half decade and decade.  One of the things that currently restricts that option is the availability of resources.  People who are entitled to give evidence by way of video link are not being prevented from doing so by a lack of options or resources, but these add to the delays because only a certain number of trials can proceed at any one time.

Under each special measure, I listed who is entitled to it, when they are entitled to it and what conditions have to be fulfilled.  It is a huge patchwork of different conditions for every special measure.  A dominant theme, as the Senator will know very well, is that if someone is under 18 or has a mental disorder, as defined by the legislation only, there is practically a presumption in favour of getting many separate special measures.  The point, which Ms Kenny put so well, is that the effects of the trauma of sexual violence and the difficulties of testifying do not end the day a person turns 18.  People are not then magically able to go into a courtroom and explain happily to a room full of strangers what happened to them.  They still need those special measure.  As I said, I see survivors of sexual violence as inherently vulnerable by dint of the trauma they have suffered.

My questions are mainly for Mr. Hayes and Ms Murphy and relate to sexual history.  The O'Malley report states that the working group takes the view that the terms of the current application strike a fair balance between protecting the rights of accused persons and those of victims in sexual offence trials and it does not recommend any change to this section.  I struggle to understand parts of that.  When I look closer, the onus appears to be solely on the judge to decide whether an application to question a victim on his or her previous sexual history is approved.  We know from statistics that it is a common practice, with figures estimating that up to two-thirds of trials involve sexual history evidence being admitted.  Do we have detailed guidance as to when relevant evidence should be admitted?  How do the judges in those cases determine what is and is not important or what is admitted?  Does the judge have to provide some sort of summary or insight as to how and why he came to the decision that evidence relating to sexual history is permissible?  Whatever about Senator Ward being conflicted as a member of the Bar, I am conflicted as a woman who has been raped.<\/p><p>The idea of sexual history, which is something I would have to contend with, is something that would keep me out of the court room.  I wonder if this is one of the biggest issues, yet the Review of Protections for Vulnerable Witnesses in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences, the O&rsquo;Malley report, does not recommend any change in this.  I am not looking for an outright ban as I understand the logic of the application of reasonable doubt and everything needed by that, but is there something that the O&rsquo;Malley report could have recommended in order to ensure there is more accountability and transparency in how evidence is permissible and how these decisions are made with regard to previous sexual history?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#E01500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I will answer Senator Ruane&rsquo;s question on behalf of the Bar Council.  The position is that it is the judge&rsquo;s decision as to whether questions on the sexual history of a complainant or victim can be allowed or permitted in the course of a trial and the judge will have to give a reason as to why he feels it is appropriate.  When the application is made, defence counsel have to make it very clear why it is relevant.  More and more, there are rulings from trial judges where they say that if one is asking for perhaps five different aspects, and the judge does not see the relevance of two to three of those aspects, the judge will then refuse those questions outright but will allow the application on those other aspects for a particular reason.  In all cases, the judge will have to explain his reasons as to why he sees the relevance.  As Mr. Hayes pointed out and as is clear from all of the testimony, the position is that victims have their own representation for the purpose of that application.  On many occasions what can and does happen is that a victim will say to their representative that she understands, for example -  I am not talking here about any particular case - that this is her ex-boyfriend and that he might want to question her about &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo; or &ldquo;C&rdquo; and she has no issue at all with that question being asked.  Frequently, there is agreement to some extent from the victims themselves as to the extent of the questioning.  It is not something in my experience that is done lightly by any judge to allow questioning on previous sexual history.  Certainly, in cases where the complainant or victim was a child at the time of the offence, judges are reluctant to allow questioning on sexual history because it is very difficult to see a link in those circumstances and the judge would need a very particular reason for relevance to be shown.<\/p> <p>  The relevance test is a high bar and judges are reluctant to allow people, as referred to by the Senator, to be questioned about something so personal and there has to be a very relevant reason as to why that should be done.  This is in recognition of the standard of proof and the presumption of innocence but this is a very careful decision which is made by any judge in such cases.

These cases predominantly involve women.  If the experience in court and the performance of the court is improved, that will also improve the performance for people who do not actually make it to court.  I know that the decisions as to whether to bring forward cases are made on the likelihood of a conviction and not necessarily on the merits of the case, as such.  The decisions are made on the basis of whether the case can get through the court system, which is a problem.  If we are successful in amending how the courts deal with cases that could lead, hopefully, to proceeding with many more prosecutions.  <\/p> <p>  In 2018, for example, there were 2,771 victims of sexual assault, but in the same year there were 304 convictions.  That amounts to 11% of the victims of assault.<\/p> <p>  Something that should also be looked at is that it is very hard to find statistics on the number of cases prosecuted, and so forth, through the courts.  I had difficulty with this but perhaps I was just not looking in the right place.  <\/p> <p>  I have a specific question where the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides for a review of unduly lenient sentences.  In 2017, 63% of sentences reviewed were increased and in 2018, 72% of sentences were increased.  That shows me a system that is not working because no system of appeals should have such a high increase in the sentences delivered.  When will we expect to see a change in this and how will we see this working?   This should also lead to an increase in cases going forward and the courts system could end up being a victim of its own success in needing more resources to enable a more successful system to work.  It would probably be for the Department to respond on how it might deal with this and perhaps the Law Society might deal with the point about the appeals of unsuccessful cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#F00800","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>I will put those points now to the Bar Council and to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#F00900","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman.

On Deputy Pringle&rsquo;s question on the undue leniency appeals and what appears to be their high rate of success, it is important to say that the bar that is set by the Court of Appeal in respect of a change of sentence with regard to undue leniency is by its very nature not one of leniency but of undue leniency and it is quite a high test.  For that purpose, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in my experience, tends to be quite careful in the cases that she selects to go forward.  She does not apply for appeals in terms of leniency, where in her view a sentence is merely lenient, but she needs to form the view that it has been unduly lenient.  She carefully selects the appeals that are taken and the ones that are taken are those that tend to have fallen quite far outside what would be considered the norm.  The reason that these cases have had such a high success rate is because she does not appeal the ones, in my experience, that might be considered more marginal.  It is only in the cases that are strikingly lenient, perhaps, that the appeals are taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>Can I ask the Department to respond briefly now, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#F01100","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>I mention, first, that sentencing is a matter for judges and not for the Department.

I join others in thanking the witnesses for their powerful testimony and their pre-meeting submission, which was very helpful to us.  This is one of the most difficult aspects of crime to prosecute.  We made progress in recent times on it, but our history has not been good.  The issue is always to balance the presumption of innocence in a fair trial with avoiding the re-traumatisation of victims.  As has been stated, we have just passed new legislation in the D&aacute;il which has to go to the Seanad on pretrial hearings.  That is the area I want to ask a question about.  How much can we address at the pretrial level, particularly in the context of pre-recorded testimony?  A great deal of the evidence we have received refers to undue delay and lack of memory and, therefore, people almost being tricked or trapped into trying to recall things in a level of detail.  How much can we capture immediately post the alleged crime and present that as uncontested evidence?  Is there scope there?<\/p> <p>  Similarly, in regard to the structure of the courts themselves, I am interested in the view of the representatives from Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  We had great discussion in the past about making courts child-friendly and unintimidating.  Do we need to fundamentally look at the physical structure of the courts?  Can we do anything in that regard?<\/p> <p>  It is a given that we need to look at legal representation for victims.

The physical environment is certainly important for any witness, including vulnerable witnesses.  There is no question about that.  We are talking about the physical security of witnesses due to give evidence about extremely intimate and difficult personal matters who face a triggering experience of being re-traumatised.  It is all very difficult, but much can be done to improve the physical comfort and security of the building itself.  Where, unfortunately, it is not possible to wave a magic wand and change the physical configuration of the building, it is about having the right attitude among all those who are concerned with that victim.  I refer to the court accompaniment people, the Courts Service staff, the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a victim will meet, the prosecuting lawyer and the way the victim is treated by the judge so that they all have the victim's need for privacy and security well in mind.<\/p> <p>  If one is faced with a situation where one does not have a great building, where it is quite small and it is hard to avoid contact with the accused, who as we know very often is on bail, as a witness very often one is terrified of meeting that person.  The victim has every reason to know that he or she is likely to be triggered by seeing the person again, to the point where he or she would be unable to talk to anybody about anything.  Then it is a question of working together to find imaginative solutions such as having everybody arrive at different times and for people to be escorted everywhere.  One can find some solution if one has the right attitude and the right understanding that this is a traumatic and difficult experience.  It is in the interests of the witness but also of the whole system, if you like, to ensure that a witness feels as secure and safe as possible.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if that answers Deputy Howlin's question.  When he first began to talk, I saw it from a different point of view.  I wondered if it was a question about a specialist court.  I know it is not something that I have spent time on in our submission.  In a way, we have at least half a specialist court anyway.  Deputy Howlin may be aware that in Scotland a cross-judicial agency review was published recommending the creation of a single specialist court there.

It is the most horrific thing that has happened to victims and it is difficult enough to relive that experience with a therapist in a safe environment.

I found the contributions harrowing in many ways but very necessary at the same time.  As a previous speaker said, it is difficult to put one's finger on the extent of this problem in society.

It is a restriction on the defence being allowed to question the victim generally about prior sexual history that is not relevant to the offence at hand.  We already have restrictions of that type.  They have been improved at various points through the years.  One cannot question a victim in a rape trial about any prior sexual history other than the actual encounter at hand in the prosecution without the permission of the judge.  One of the recommendations in the O'Malley report is that victims will be able to have their legal representative with them in court during that questioning to ensure that it stays within the bounds of the permission that was given by the court.  That is a change that was recommended by Tom O'Malley and it is something that we are committed to implementing in the sexual offences Bill this year.  Of course, we must consider how we can continue to improve that because it is not in anybody's interest for victims to be retraumatised and revictimised during the proceedings and that is something we would like to avoid.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of resourcing for the courts, I think my colleague, Mr. &Oacute; Briain, might be better placed to provide information to the Senator.

I would like their feedback on my observations and ask them to perhaps extrapolate a little further.  All present have spoken to victims at various points.  I was very surprised to hear that a solicitor who is herself a victim but whose legal expertise is not in this particular area found the whole courtroom experience as a victim very off-putting in terms of the language that was used, the workings of a courtroom on the day in terms of when people are giving evidence and the theatre, if one likes, that can often ensue.  Although the professionals, that is, the barristers and solicitors who are involved in this area on a daily basis, are used to and aware of that and know the workings of it, what I have garnered from speaking to victims is that it can be another aspect that is re-traumatising and very off-putting.  It almost encourages them to just call a halt to the process.  What shocked me most was that the person to whom I refer has a legal background.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ward referred to training for barristers.  What was described to me was a disconnect in terms of how that manifests on the day of the courtroom hearing compared with how the victim feels.  The courtroom experience serves to create a feeling of isolation and further compounds the trauma the victim has been through.  Can we do more in that regard?  Deputy Kenny spoke about the idea of video links, while Deputy Howlin spoke about how we can improve the court structure, which might entail physical changes to the building in the context of how a victim gives evidence.  We now from feedback from victims that they feel retraumatised.  The trauma they have been through is further compounded by their perhaps not being made fully aware of the atmosphere into which they will be stepping or how proceedings happen.  Senator Ward stated that training is now taking place for barristers.  I would have thought that would have already been in place.  Obviously, it was not.  How can the committee improve on that for victims?

Our experience and that of our clients is just as she described.  The procedures take over in a courtroom and the victim is often forgotten in that scenario.  They walk into something quite alien.  The experience of sexual violence is a very personal one.<\/p><p>Then, suddenly, they are being spoken of in the third person in the context of the intimate and traumatic experiences they have had and all of this is spoken about in a way they are not familiar with.  That is why we recommend an impact assessment is done on how those procedures play out and the impact on the witnesses we are asking to take part in the process.<\/p><p> Again, language is so important and powerful.  There is the whole construct of legalese and this can often be off-putting for someone.  Language is often used as a device as well.  Sometimes a silence, a tone or a certain approach can trigger a traumatic response that people are not expecting.  My experience of working with survivors in court is that they get that the law will do its thing but they are quite taken aback by the inhumane approach.  That is not to make it personal for the professionals involved.  It is simply that the system takes over and they are not really at the centre of that.  Ms Counihan and others have commented on how we really need to focus on their well-being in this.  We want to get the best from them.  If we are to increase positive outcomes in these situations, we really need to focus on how we can bring the law and the trauma together in a more humane way.  That can certainly be done.  While I have highlighted some of the negative things our clients have talked about, there have been positive experiences in courtrooms for them as well.  This is often because the personnel involved have been very gentle and have approached them in a way that is compassionate.

I have prosecuted and defended these types of cases.  Certain court environments are better set up than others to look after the welfare of the victim.  For example, the Criminal Courts of Justice building has a victim's suite.  This allows a victim to have an area of privacy where they know they will not come anywhere near an accused person or any other witnesses in the case.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has a system in place whereby all victims are met by prosecution counsel prior to trial.  They are also met with victim support people from the Criminal Courts of Justice who can show them around the building.  A considerable amount is being done to try to assist victims and make them feel more comfortable insofar as that can be done prior to court hearings.  Obviously, anything that can assist a victim to feel more comfortable is worthy and should be done.  It is not appropriate for someone in that environment to be re-traumatised, as Ms Kenny said.

It takes a lot for a man to actually disclose that he has been raped.  It is not language that they often use.  Moreover, our legislation does not recognise female-on-male rape and this is a barrier for them.  We have a case that might be going through live this year.  We are going to support our client all the way through with counselling.  It took the person several months of counselling before it came out in a counselling session.  Again, it was a great and brave step for that gentleman to come forward.  Then there was great work from our colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support him in terms of gathering evidence, etc.  From last year to date, we have heard of 13 disclosures.  The previous year there were only five or six reported.  Again, it is about using the language.  The Government, the Department of Justice and the Garda all have roles.  The Still Here and No Excuses campaigns worked hard over 2020 as well.  I believe we are getting the message out for victims not to stay silent.  It is great that they are coming forward and speaking, but obviously we have to resource or find the resources to walk with them on the journey.<\/p> <p>  The trauma felt is an issue.  One person mentioned to us some weeks ago that he felt he was still in the fog of the domestic and sexual violence.  We ramped up our communication with the person, although not too much.  There was a text message and then a call some days later.  He is still in the fog.  He is out of the situation but the way it was described was as an absolutely surreal experience.  This highlights the importance of having someone who is trauma informed and of having a front-line experienced person to walk the victim through it.  Perhaps the family did not get it.  Perhaps friends might not necessarily have got it or really understood the true dynamics of domestic and sexual violence.

Last night I watched an hour-long documentary on BBC about sexual abuse of young boys and men in football.  We heard of the extraordinary obstacles they had when it came of making any disclosures at all.  This was partially based on their gender and the social attitude towards male victims of sexual assault.  It was harrowing to watch the programme because these were men in their 50s weeping because of their recollections of what had happened to them and how they had suppressed what had happened to them.<\/p> <p>  One question I have relates to the extent to which anyone now being accused of a sexual offence can rely on the right not to give evidence.  Is that gone?  There was a time when it was sometimes deployed and the accused simply never gave evidence.  There is a case to be made for not allowing unsworn exculpatory explanations or statements made by the accused to garda&iacute; investing the matter to come into evidence, especially if it is circumvented the sexual history prohibition that would normally be there.  My question is for the practitioners and the support groups.  Is it the case that no one sits out a case anymore and simply relies on the statements made to the Garda?  Is that a real issue any longer?<\/p> <p>  Is it thought that the Director of Public Prosecutions prosecution criteria are too strict or just about right?  Are they too lax?  Is it fair to put someone who is a complainant, whether male or female, in a weak case through the process of a trial to avoid the accusation of not being supportive?<\/p><p>If we are to try to eliminate all the preliminary issues and the trials within trials and have a straightforward trial of the issues in future in accordance with what the Department of Justice is planning to do, as I fully support, is there a case for some kind of standardised training video to be made available to a jury once empanelled to get across some of the background difficulties of trying a sexual assault case?  The Judicial Council might approve a video, which would remind a jury of some of the basic facts.  I know it is the judge's duty to charge a jury and bring relevant propositions to a jury's attention, but judges vary and some of them are better communicators than others.<\/p><p> There might be something to be said for supplying juries with a video once empanelled to set out some of the basic facts about the difficulties witnesses face, the complexities of sexual cases and the rules that are applied in order that the jury knows, for instance, that the sexual history of a complainant is not normally permitted to be gone into.  Those are issues that should be brought to the attention of juries to give them some help in carrying out their functions.  It might be useful to give them an educational video in that context.  <\/p><p> I seek some feedback on those three points.  It is a long time since I appeared in a criminal case, let alone a sexual criminal case, and I am interested to know whether people can allow their counsel to attack their accuser, and then sit back, give no evidence at all and rely on an explanation given to the Garda getting in by the back door.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#J00700","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1267,"content":"<p>Are the Senator's questions addressed to anybody in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#K00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>Perhaps the criminal practitioners here might say something about that but I do not want to confine it to them alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#K00300","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>I can deal with that.  In trials, accused persons can certainly rely on their right to silence and not give evidence in a case.  When an accused person is interviewed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the proper procedures, he or she can put forward his or her case to those garda&iacute; and obviously defence counsel is obliged to put that case to the victim in court.  I appreciate what the Senator said that in some ways, that could be getting in by the back door previous sexual history matters that might not be relevant.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make it clear that those interviews can be excised and part of them can be removed for the purpose of going to the jury if there are aspects of it that are totally irrelevant and that should not play any part in the trial.  That would be contingent on the ruling of the trial judge on the application for questions to be asked on the previous sexual history of the complainant or victim.  An accused person's simply making reference to something in his or her interview with the Garda will not be enough to make it relevant for the purposes of the trial.  If necessary, trial judges can order that those parts of the interview are irrelevant and should be excised.  However, it is not always the case and I could not give statistics on it.  Anecdotally, it seems to be the case that in the past five years at least, accused persons are more likely to give evidence at trial.  <\/p> <p>  Senator McDowell mentioned the possibility of there being some provision whereby it is not acceptable for an accused person to give an account to the Garda and sit back in court and say nothing.  I think that could have ramifications elsewhere to preclude somebody giving his or her own account to the Garda when he or she is interviewed in respect of a sexual offence but not in respect of other offences.  I think there could be difficulties in that regard.

Several points have come up during the meeting.  Deputy Howlin made a very fair point about court structures, which applies more widely and not only in cases of sexual violence.  It always struck me as strange that in Tralee Circuit Court where I used to practise, all the witnesses sat right in front of the accused or sometimes the co-accused.  In many cases the closest person to them in the court was the accused person.  I always thought they should be sitting on the other side of the court.  That should certainly be looked at.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Mr. Hayes said in response to Deputy Pringle's question about appeals taken by the DPP.  In my experience the current DPP and her predecessors have always been quite choosy about the number and types of cases they take.  It does not surprise me that the number of appeals is relatively small but the statistics will back that up.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Carberry and Ms Murphy made very valid points about the cross-examination of witnesses.  There is an idea out there that it is a free-for-all against witnesses, complainants and victims who are giving their evidence in court.  It is certainly my experience that this is not the case and that there are protections for the victims in place which are not widely known.  It is very dangerous for someone defending an accused person to go down that line because one risks being absolutely hammered if a guilty verdict is brought in.  That is the practicality of it.<\/p> <p>  Cases of domestic violence are treated differently all the way along.  Those in jail for drugs offences, domestic violence offences and sexual assault offences do not qualify for temporary release in the same way that they would if they had been convicted for other types of offences.  <\/p> <p>  Coming from my background in criminal defence, I recognise it is a difficult one, balancing the rights of an accused person.  I read some excellent suggestions made by One in Four and by RCNI.  I agree with most of them.  One suggestion proposed allowing any victim of sexual violence to have their evidence-in-chief prerecorded and stand as evidence in trial.  I think that would be a step too far, balancing the rights of an accused person.  <\/p> <p>  One of Senator McDowell's questions related to the attitude of the DPP in bringing cases forward for trial.  He seemed to be asking whether more cases are brought forward for prosecution in sexual assault and rape cases than others.  I am not so sure about that.  In the past I have represented people who strenuously denied the accusations.  They have their rights.  Their families, partners and wives have been affected by that case hanging over them for five years.  In a few instances, the cases were eventually dismissed.  It is difficult to balance both of them, but some excellent suggestions have been made.  <\/p> <p>  I have one question for RCNI about how the statistics are compiled by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I read some but not all of an excellent report about rape and justice in Ireland that the RCNI prepared.  Is it happy with the way statistics are compiled in this jurisdiction?  There were some fascinating statistics in the presentation about the attitudes to accused persons of, for example, male-dominated as against female-dominated juries.  Is the RCNI happy with the way the statistics are compiled?  An interesting statistic that came out of its report was that African people were ten times more likely to be accused in cases like this.  Did that also follow through with prosecutions?  That is all I will say on the matter but I again thank all the witnesses for their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#K00600","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>The report, Rape &amp;amp; Justice in Ireland, was published in 2009.  In my dream universe, we would be doing a follow-up report on it now because the world has changed an awful lot.  The Deputy asked whether we are happy with the way statistics are compiled in this country.  It is quite disparate.  There are the Garda recorded crime figures, in another box on another website altogether are the DPP's figures and in a third box are the Courts Service figures.<\/p> <p>  I would love to see, in the DPP's annual report, a breakdown of the reasons sexual offences, in particular, might not be prosecuted.  I would also love to know the proportion of sexual offences, or files concerning sexual offences, that result in a prosecution for any offence.  At the time of publication of Rape &amp;amp; Justice in Ireland, the DPP very kindly allowed the researchers to enlist the assistance of DPP staff.  In fact, DPP staff filled out questionnaires, not from a sample but from the entire number of files for a given four-year period, and compiled statistics from that.  I went back to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions about a year ago to ask if it was possible to determine the proportion of sexual offence files from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which result in a prosecution and also to break down the reasons they might not be prosecuted.  It explained that it was not possible to do this exercise digitally and it could really only be done manually.  As I understood it, the office did not have the resources to do it.  If possible, I would love to know what the proportion is because then I could give more meaningful advice to people who ask what the chances are that a file will even get as far as the DPP, never mind any further.<\/p> <p>  Having said all that, while the Director of Public Prosecutions does live up to a fairly stringent test, she has also pushed the boundaries of it and has been more liberal in recent times.  Survivors have benefited from that.  I am not talking about a huge effect but that is my anecdotal impression.  I do not have statistics on it.  It is very hard in our statistics system to track a case, complaint or victim from the beginning right through the process.  In a given year, one is not talking about the same cases.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a bundle of recorded cases or complaints that are separate from, and probably do not much overlap with, what has got as far as the DPP in a given year and what is with the DPP is not necessarily what reaches the Courts Service.  One is always comparing apples with pears and cauliflowers.  It is not a unitary system.  I do not know enough about statistics to know if a system could be devised that has a single identifying number for every case, charge, victim or perpetrator.  To answer the Deputy's question, it is not very satisfactory.  <\/p> <p>  I am always finding things that are not obvious but should be.  For example, although it has improved in recent times, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, categories of recorded crime include a huge category of \"other sexual offences\" which lumps various offences together.  One can find out the breakdown for a particular offence but it is necessary to ask the CSO.  I am sure it is a question of resources, not ability, but it is cumbersome and not easy to work with. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021032300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Counihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>The point about a single identifying number to track processes through different State institutions is a very good one.

Delay is not the only issue that affects victims who go through the courts system but it is important.  We have included in our submission the impact delays can have on victims, witnesses and anybody involved in the trial.  It is important to do as much as possible to ameliorate that.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that the delay pre-existed Covid-19.  The delays in Dublin Circuit Court before Covid-19 were in the region of 15 to 18 months.  It now takes approximately two years before a case comes to the Circuit Court, assuming everything goes smoothly.  An issue with later disclosure can knock that back by several months.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Lewis referred to a statement in the O'Malley report that extra judges were not needed.  This is one of the few things we disagree with in the O'Malley report.  Additional judges are needed at all levels.  The Bar organised a conference on Friday on the effects of Covid-19 at which the President of the High Court, Ms Justice Irvine, spoke.  She indicated she had called for an additional 15 to 20 High Court judges for all matters because of the increase in work and the impact of Covid-19.  The Bar of Ireland agrees with that and it is important that as much as possible is done to reduce delays in the system.  <\/p> <p>  If a case were to come before the courts, with the offence having been committed today, there would be a Garda investigation.  Even if the investigation were brief, it would be a number of months before it got to the courts.  It would be two years thereafter before it got to trial.  Even with everything running smoothly, it will take the best part of three years from the date of the offence to the date of the trial.  That time should be substantially shorter.

At the outset, I remind members of the joint committee that in order to have a duly constituted meeting and for it to proceed members are required to join the meeting remotely from within the defined precincts of Leinster House.  I ask members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the recording system.  As members are participating remotely from their offices, I ask that they would click on the raise hand icon at any point if they wish to contribute during the proceedings of the meeting and remain on mute until such time as I call them to speak.<\/p><p>I now turn to the main item on our agenda which is the discussion on the Roadmap to Social Inclusion.  In this regard, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and his officials - Ms Geraldine Hurley, assistant secretary at the Department of Social Protection, Dr. Dermot Coates, the chief economist at the Department of Social Protection, and Ms Bairbre Nic Aonghusa, assistant secretary at the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p><p>Since 1997, as a country, we have put in place successive national strategies focusing on the reduction of poverty and social exclusion in society.  Today we will look at and discuss the current strategy, which is the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025.  There are many different ways that we can measure poverty and deprivation but for me the most basic measure is hunger.  We need to start addressing it by focusing on our children.<\/p><p>No child should go to bed hungry.  A child will never reach his or her full potential if that child sits at a school desk hungry.  According to a study by the State agency <i>safe<\/i>food, 10% of the population lives in food poverty yet we, as a food producing country, dump nearly 2 tonnes of food every minute.  While there has been a welcome expansion in the school meals programme, what impact has Covid-19 had on the children who relied on these school meals not to go hungry?  It is not just about hunger.  It is also about the types of foods that families can afford to buy, which is contributing to the HSE figures indicating that one in five five year old children is either overweight or obese.<\/p><p>It is clear to this committee that Government policy can make a positive difference in addressing the fundamental issue of hunger, and improving people's lives and broader society as a whole.  The roadmap has a stated ambition to reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less, and to make Ireland one of the most socially inclusive countries in the EU.  With that in mind, I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State as to how likely we are to achieve this ambition.<\/p><p>Members of the committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of the statements made to either House of the Oireachtas or before the committee.

It is safe to say that one cannot exist without the other.  This is reflected in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion, which notes the important and long-acknowledged partnership between the State and the community and voluntary sector in addressing poverty, social exclusion and inequality at a local and national level.<\/p> <p>  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 was approved by the then Government and published in January 2020.  It is the latest in a number of successive strategies dating back to 1997 which aim to reduce poverty and improve social inclusion in Ireland.  In a matter of weeks after its publication, Ireland had to deal with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the introduction of resultant public health restrictions on our lives.  Nevertheless, its implementation remains a priority - one that is reflected in the programme for Government as well which commits to its rigorous implementation.<\/p> <p>  The roadmap is a five-year whole-of-government strategy with the ambition of reducing consistent poverty to 2% or less, and making Ireland one of the most socially inclusive countries in the EU.  This will require improvements in the provision of support for workers and their families, the expansion of employment opportunities to all who are in a position to work, continued improvements in supports for children, older people and people with a disability, ongoing investment at community level, and ensuring access for all to basic services that we all need to thrive.  Under the current conditions within the economy and social and health challenges resulting from the pandemic, this is ambitious and will require focused and collaborative effort across Government.<\/p> <p>  The roadmap acknowledges the range of existing sectoral strategies, policies and plans across Government and does not seek to duplicate them.  It aims to enhance and complement existing strategies and inform the development of new strategies, such as the recently published national volunteering strategy, to ensure that social inclusion is at the core of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  The roadmap contains 66 commitments to be delivered, in some cases by individual Departments and in others by a number of Departments working in collaboration, such as the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice to implement the additional three weeks parental leave in April this year and will be extended to seven weeks over the subsequent three years.<\/p> <p>  Implementation of many of the roadmap commitments is under way and a number are either fully achieved or close to completion.  These include the publication of the new further education and training strategy, the full roll-out of the national childcare scheme, and the publication of the volunteering strategy, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  There has also been progress in the development of the new employment services strategy, the successor to Pathways to Work; the provision of &euro;5 million in dormant accounts funding to support and improve employment opportunities for carers and people with a disability; the development of the new rural development policy which is due to be published next week; the development of a ten-year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy which was announced in September 2020; and, the continued provision of the school meals programme during 2020, including during school closures and during the summer where needed.<\/p> <p>  In addition, despite the challenging economic circumstances, budget 2021 included targeted social protection measures to help individuals and families on low incomes.  This included, among other changes, increases to the qualified child rates which will benefit some 419,000 children at a cost of &euro;59 million in 2021; adjustment of the income thresholds for the working family payment with some 48,000 families benefiting in 2021 at a cost of &euro;21 million; an increase to the living alone allowance which will benefit some 22,000 people; and, an increase to the weekly rate for the fuel allowance benefiting some 375,000 people at a cost of &euro;36 million in 2021.  I was also pleased that budget 2021 included a provision for new pilot community development projects with funding of &euro;1 million available in 2021.  Applications for this fund are currently open.<\/p><p> As Minister of State in the Department of Social Protection, I have responsibility for the community employment, CE, scheme, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  These schemes meet a number of departmental objectives, including supporting long-term unemployed people in returning to employment, while helping to deliver vital services to local communities.<\/p><p> Support and funding remained in place for over 19,000 participants engaged in more than 850 CE schemes and over 7,000 participants in T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.  Funding for CE, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme will amount to more than &euro;500 million in 2021.  During each period of level-5 restrictions, CE and T&uacute;s participants, whose contracts were due to end during the period of the restrictions, had contracts extended for the duration of those restrictions.  Earlier this month, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I announced a further CE and T&uacute;s contract extension for those participants who are affected, up until 2 July 2021.  Over 7,000 CE and T&uacute;s participants are benefiting from these contract extensions.  There will be no sudden cliff edge or cut-off point for these contracts after this date.  Contracts will come to an end in a phased and planned manner after this date as the number of new referrals to schemes increases as restrictions ease.  It is particularly important that CE schemes continue to offer those who have not had a chance to be on a CE scheme in the past and who are furthest from the labour market opportunities to develop their experience and skills in a workplace setting and carry out valuable training at the same time.  It is important to be mindful of particularly marginalised groups in this regard, including people recovering from addiction, Travellers and members of the Roma community.  <\/p><p> The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is a &euro;190 million five-year programme running from 2018 to 2022 that provides supports to help marginalised individuals and the groups that assist them.  It has provided one-to-one support to over 70,000 individuals and assisted over 4,000 local community groups.  This type of work will be more important than ever as we recover from the pandemic.  <\/p><p> I am chairing the social inclusion roadmap steering group, which has been established to manage and oversee the successful implementation of the roadmap commitments.  Members of the group include senior officials from each Department with responsibility for roadmap commitments, along with three representatives from the community and voluntary sector.  The group first met on 11 November 2020 and the second meeting is scheduled for this day next week, 30 March.  <\/p><p> At the first meeting, I highlighted the need for collaborative work between Departments to drive the delivery of commitments.  I asked members to consider how Covid-19 has affected people who are experiencing deprivation and poverty.  It is important that those who were vulnerable or struggling before the pandemic are not left behind once we are able to lift the pandemic restrictions and the economy begins to recover.<\/p><p> The roadmap ambition and the programme for Government ambition is to reduce the national consistent poverty rate in Ireland to 2% or less by 2025.  This is perhaps the most significant commitment in the programme for Government.  Since the recording of the rate of consistent poverty began, we have never reached a rate of less than 2%.  It is fair to say that if we reach that rate of poverty, it will be lowest ever in the history of the State and before it.  The current rate of consistent poverty in Ireland, based on 2019 figures, is 5.5%.  This rate is higher for more vulnerable groups, such as children, lone parents and people with a disability.  Over the next four years, we will need to reduce the national figure significantly to achieve the targets set out in the roadmap.  <\/p><p> The 2020 Survey on Income and Living Conditions data will be published by the CSO towards the end of this year and will provide updated data on those experiencing poverty and exclusion during the period in which the pandemic and public health restrictions first impacted on our lives in 2020.  <\/p><p> It is important to state the roadmap is not a static document.  Many of the commitments are front-loaded, to be completed within the first half of the roadmap's lifetime.  There is a review planned for 2022.  I will be eager to conduct that as early as possible as the challenges and contexts have changed significantly since the roadmap's initial publication.  We have a new programme for Government with very significant and new commitments related to social inclusion, such as the ending of direct provision and the introduction of a new regularisation scheme for undocumented migrants.  Additional challenges have come to the fore in the last year in the context of the pandemic.  The principles of just transition and climate justice need to be reflected in a plan for social inclusion.  We have a new Department with a key role to play in the promotion of social inclusion.  In this context, I am delighted that my colleague Deputy Harris, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, has agreed to develop new commitments for inclusion in the roadmap.  I acknowledge his commitment to social inclusion in his portfolio.<\/p><p> The roadmap includes a commitment on the production of an annual report on progress against each commitment.  Work on the 2020 annual report is well under way and will be presented to this committee for discussion once it has been submitted to the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality for consideration.  <\/p><p> On 12 March, we passed a significant milestone, marking a full year since we entered lockdown as part of our efforts to deal with the spread of the Covid-19 virus across Ireland.  During the past 12 months, we have seen the health impacts as infection rates have risen and fallen.  The economic impacts have been severe, with large sectors of the economy closed for long periods, leading to a Covid-adjusted unemployment rate, which includes the 465,000 persons receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of just under 25%.  Many of those currently receiving the PUP will return to employment once the economy reopens.  We will need to focus attention on providing employment supports to those whose jobs will not return, but also to those who were unemployed prior to the arrival of Covid.  <\/p><p> In response to the economic impact of the pandemic and the associated public health restrictions implemented to curb the spread of the virus, the State launched a number of emergency income and business supports in March 2020 with the objective of providing a level of income certainty for those whose employment was affected by the crisis.  To date, these critical supports, which include the PUP and the wage subsidy schemes, have resulted in cumulative expenditure of over &euro;11 billion. <\/p><p> The positive effect of these interventions is reflected in an ESRI report published last year.  It examined the impact of the Covid pandemic on unemployment in Ireland, estimating how family incomes had changed as a result of increased unemployment.  It found that as a result of the initial Covid pandemic policy responses, household income fell by 3%, on average.  This was in comparison with an estimated fall of 7% in the absence of these responses.  <\/p><p> In addition to these measures, the State has put in place a comprehensive suite of business supports for Irish employers.  This is important to refer to in today's context owing to the key role of employment in social inclusion.  These measures include, among others, the Covid restrictions support scheme, the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, the Covid-19 working capital scheme, the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme, the commercial rates waiver and the warehousing of deferred tax debts.  Combined, these supports continue to relieve some of the financial pressure weighing on Irish employers as they navigate the economic crisis.  <\/p><p> All of this underscores the importance of the roadmap for social inclusion.  While it was developed and approved before the pandemic, its ambition and focus remain relevant and continue to be a priority.  The coming years will no doubt bring more challenges and difficult choices as the country, economy and society find their way through this pandemic and move out the other side.  While we must, and should, focus on economic solutions, they have to be developed within the broader context so the most vulnerable within our society will not become more marginalised or be left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#A00300","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1448,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

He makes a fair point.  There are many supports available.  There are a couple of points I would make in response, particularly in the context of the past 12 months.  Intreo offices have remained open.  They are open at least three mornings a week in most communities.  That is the first thing I would say to a person who ask me what they are entitled to, apart from asking them to outline their circumstances.  There are offices open across the country and people can drop in to them.  Obviously, we are primarily directing people to access online information.  I am not going to tell people to look at the website because they know that it is available.  In terms of having a person with whom to interact on a one-to-one basis such that the complexity of a situation can be described, examined and considered and the appropriateness of the various payments can be considered, I make that additional point about the Intreo offices.<\/p><p>There have been fairly significant public information campaigns in the past 12 months, particularly around the PUP.  Access to the PUP is quite broad; many groups can access it.  That message has been going out on pretty much every channel we can use to get the message across.<\/p><p>If we are speaking about people who are in difficult situations and who may not be fully <i>au fait <\/i>with their entitlements, I draw attention to SICAP.  The latter is operated by 49 local development companies across the country.  They are in every community.  They have workers embedded in communities who know where the vulnerabilities lie in those communities.  Their services have remained accessible during this time, although not necessarily in the same open-door manner as the Intreo offices.  Those are the three initial responses I would offer on the fair point raised by the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#C00200","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  It is really welcome that we are having this discussion.  It is the first such discussion we have had in the Oireachtas, given that the roadmap was published and then the general election was announced very soon thereafter.  I suppose the opportunity for a much wider discussion on the elements of the roadmap and the proposals put forward in it kind of fell away.  Of course, as has been referenced, Covid then came along and made a bad situation worse in terms of poverty and deprivation.  We must bear in mind that the previous roadmap ended in 2017 but we had to wait until 2020 for this new roadmap.  For those reasons, and particularly in light of the impact of Covid, we need a great sense of urgency in terms of meeting the commitments in the roadmap.<\/p> <p>  The roadmap contains a list of 69 commitments.  How many of those are fully complete?  How many of them have missed the timeline for completion, necessitating slight changes to the timeline?  The level of monitoring is very important.  Aside from the steering group, is there any other level of monitoring in the context of achieving and meeting the commitments?  I am very concerned that the steering group has only met once.  I appreciate that a meeting is scheduled for next week.  If this issue is to be a serious priority for the Government and if the steering group is going to oversee and manage the commitments as they are outlined in the Minister of State's the opening statement and the related documentation, then it needs to meet more than once or twice a year.<\/p> <p>  The upcoming review in 2022 is welcome.  Does the Minister of State envisage that the document will be updated in any way at that stage in light of the impact of Covid and several of the commitments contained in the roadmap?  For example, there is a focus on the national minimum wage and keeping that as a floor, yet in the programme for Government there is a move towards the living wage, which, of course, is welcome.  Will that aspect be considered or updated in the context of the review?<\/p> <p>  I was very surprised by the fact that so many of the social welfare rates are set below the poverty line.  I know several stakeholders flagged this issue.  There is no mention of benchmarking to adequacy or the minimum essential standard of living.  I am really concerned about that.  We have social welfare rates that are below the poverty line and if nothing is included in terms of how to lift people out of poverty, that is of concern.  The European Anti-Poverty Network, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and Social Justice Ireland all made that point in respect of this document when it was published.  I would like to see us moving towards an evidence-based approach to social welfare rates such that it would be, at least, about protecting people from poverty, rather than having the political football of a &euro;5 increase each year.  That should be a basic aim of any social protection system.<\/p> <p>  A much greater focus is needed on lone parents and their levels of consistent poverty and deprivation, which increased in 2019.  I know that increase in deprivation was across the board but it is particularly embedded for lone-parent families and I believe that needs to be examined.  Maintenance has a role to play.  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly put forward the need for a statutory child maintenance service.  I hope the maintenance review that has been set up will report shortly and consider that issue.<\/p> <p>  A small section of the roadmap deals with the issue of food poverty.  Unite the Union recently published proposals relating to deprivation that include information on food poverty.  A figure of 680,000 people living in food poverty is outlined.  What figure is the Department working off in terms of the level of food poverty?  This is obviously a significant issue that we need to examine more closely.  We need to have figures that are as accurate as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned community employment and the extension given to those who are currently on the scheme in terms of the end of their contract.  Those who are on community employment and other schemes have missed out on time on those schemes,on training opportunities and on work experience as a result of Covid.  Is an extension being considered in light of the loss of time on the schemes?  In fairness, those on the schemes have missed out.<\/p> <p>  On fuel poverty, as the Minister of State is aware, the fuel allowance was extended last year.  Is that being looked at for this year?  The current period is due to finish next month.  I ask the Minister of State to give the committee an indication in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#C00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1453,"content":"<p>The Deputy made a good opening point regarding the delay in getting the roadmap back on the agenda as a result of the election situation and then Covid.  I was eager to get the group together as quickly as possible before Christmas.  To answer her question, I will address monitoring as well what has been done and what is in progress.  Of the various commitments, eight have been achieved, six have been achieved with ongoing delivery, 52 are in progress and three are yet to commence.  That is a reflection of the fact that momentum on this only really began since the Government came into office and that many of the Departments involved had much of their resourcing pulled in a different direction.  Those tend to be the Departments that have been particularly at the forefront in the pandemic.<\/p><p>Social protection, health and children cover the majority of the commitments and so the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have had a lot of resourcing pulled in a different direction.  <\/p><p> In terms of monitoring, the group has met once and will meet again next week.  There is a great deal of interaction in between meetings as well.  For example, I have met the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, between meetings and there is ongoing engagement of officials between meetings as well.  A great deal of the work is done between meetings.  When the group gathers it is about catching up on what has been done but much of the work is progressing during meetings as well.  It is not the case that work is dropped for a couple of months and picked up again for a day or two; it is very high on my agenda.  It is a large part of my work and something I work on in one way or another every week.  There is a constant push behind it.  <\/p><p> In terms of other monitoring mechanisms, the main one is the annual report on which I report to the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality.  This committee can play a role in that regard.  I would welcome appearing before the committee periodically to update it on progress.  I think that would help momentum in implementation of the report as well to have regular public scrutiny of it.  I would be happy to do that.  <\/p><p> On the review in 2022 and whether I would envisage the document being updated, I would expect so, particularly in the context of some of the things I have outlined and on which the Deputy made some good points as well in terms of the living wage.  There are things in the programme for Government that are progressive and can be included in a revised roadmap.  I outlined a number of other reasons it needs refreshing as well.  The core of what we need to do is here in terms of the poverty targets in particular.  <\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned benchmarking.  It is referred to in the roadmap.  There is a proposal to introduce benchmarking on the pension side.  In terms of where that is at, it is not hugely progressive, but it is there in terms of something that we can push.  Following work on the pensions commitment, there is a commitment to look at other social welfare rates as well.  I would be an advocate of benchmarking.  I agree with the general point in terms of how rates are raised in a political realm rather than based on the facts of people's incomes and the gap in people's incomes.<\/p><p>I take the Deputy's point in regard to lone parents.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and I met a group of representative organisations some weeks back, where we discussed some of the issues which the Deputy touched on, which I might touch on briefly now.  On child maintenance, there is an ongoing review in that area which was flagged at that meeting.  There has been some progress made on some of the issues that were raised by the group, but the child maintenance side is getting attention and a public consultation on it was recently opened as well.  It is an issue that is recognised as one that we need to work on.  There are other issues such as changes to lone parent supports when the youngest child turns 14 that we are looking at, and the area of employment and education and the difficulties on that side.  A range of issues were discussed at that meeting that we are taking seriously.  Lone parents are one of the three groups that I would see as needing particular attention.  The other groups are people with disabilities and children.  <\/p><p> On food poverty, one the benefits in terms of the steering group is that it is a type of interdepartmental group as well in terms of the social inclusion roadmap looking at all Departments.  Food poverty is one of those issues that cuts across a number of responsibilities and possibly is one that nobody is necessarily putting up their hand to claim.  That is the situation I am in now.  We need to take ownership of food poverty in terms of where we are going to go with it.  There is a lot being done in the Department of Health.  The Chairman mentioned Safefood.  I met with it before Christmas in regard to some of its work in this area.  I am not sure of the Unite figures.  I think I read the report the Deputy spoke about, but I do not recall the figures.  <\/p><p> On the Departments figures, they are patchy.  One of the pieces of work that needs to be done is to define food poverty more clearly.  Food poverty is complex.  I am not saying that to bat it off.  It is in part about cash in the pocket, but is about accessibility as well.  There are a lot of extenuating circumstances that add to food poverty, some of which people would never think of.  For example, something as simple, or as far removed, as planning can have an impact on food poverty.  In my constituency there are sprawling housing estates on the edge of towns where there are no decent shops nearby but there are two or three chip shops that are much more accessible than the decent shop.  It is in that regard that planning is an issue.<\/p><p> My intention is to write to all Departments asking them to assess their relevance in terms of food poverty.  The Department of Health stands out in this regard, as does the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, but other Departments have a role to play.  Food poverty stood out, particularly after the first meeting of the interdepartmental group, as an issue that needs to be pulled together.  We are doing quite a bit on it in terms of the hot school meals.  The sum of &euro;65 million is budgeted for this year for school meals, which is very substantial.  That is having a real impact.  It was notable that during the pandemic when schools were closed, food provision carried on and parents picked up the food from the schools or it was delivered to them.  This signals that there is something really wrong on that side of things.  It manifests itself not just in the supports we provide, but in the need on the other end of the range scale with older people which, again, was highlighted by the pandemic.<\/p><p> The Department of Rural and Community Development provides supports to a number of organisations that facilitate meals on wheels.  For example, we support FoodCloud, which is the main distribution point for much of the funding that comes from the Department of Social Protection through the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived, FEAD, programme.  We support a number of community services programmes that implement that programme on a local basis.  Last year, Irish Rural Link was provided with a grant to do national co-ordination work in regard to meals on wheels.  The Department of Health is very much in this space in terms of the meal on wheels for older people.  I am glad that the issue of food poverty was raised.  It is a serious and tricky issue.  We have arms out there that are working on it, but we need a clearer picture on the extent of it, we need to see what we are missing and we need to pull it together in a more coherent way.  <\/p><p> On community employment, CE, I have heard that people who have completed a number of modules are concerned that because a lot of the training is not happening at the moment and they are due to finish up on the scheme in July, they may not be able to get a full qualification.  I have been reassured that if people have to exit their CE contract, which will be the case for some, Intreo will deal with them.  The officers in Intreo will go through the suite of training options available to them, with a clear intention of ensuring that what training has been done is not lost but built upon.  There are financial incentives to support that, the training support grant being the most obvious, but also the back-to-education allowance at another level.  <\/p><p> I cannot give the Deputy an update on fuel poverty.

In his introductory remarks, the Minister of State spoke about these being front-loaded.  He gave some details to Deputy Kerrane.  Would his Department be able to provide us with a note in this regard?  The Minister of State said that some are completed, some are in train and some have not begun as yet.  Will the Department provide us with a note so that we can go through it with different coloured highlighters?  If there has been front-loading, which of those that have not been reached are priorities?  Which are the ones the Minister of State really wants to complete?  Which of those he really wants to get to have not yet been actioned at all?  He has indicated that there will be a review.  I hear that this will happen in early 2022.  Are we talking about the first, second or third quarter?  I just want to tie the Minister of State down on that.  <\/p><p> He has rightly identified that what he is talking about is very interdepartmental.  Looking through the roadmap and looking at his introductory comments, I feel it chimes greatly with the well-being indices project that is under way.  One of the high-level goals relates to building inclusive communities.  I was looking at the OECD model and civil engagement is one of the areas in which we score really badly in the OECD rankings, on which we might base our well-being indices.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?  I do not know if it amounts to a question.<\/p><p> To look at the broad thrust of where we are going, there was some discussion about benchmarking.  Social Justice Ireland suggests that we should benchmark core social welfare payments at approximately 27.5% of the average wage.  In budget 2021, we very much went after the most vulnerable cohorts when providing specific funding.  That was merited, particularly in the context of Covid when a great many pandemic unemployment payments were in the mix, which may have muddied the waters.  With regard to the general approach, does the Minister of State believe we should continue to specifically target particular cohorts or would we better off looking at an increase in general social welfare payments?  Which approach does he believe would give us the best bang for our buck with regard to alleviating poverty?  <\/p><p> The Minister of State has already spoken extensively about fuel poverty.  As a primary school teacher, I believe the Department of Education has a significant role in this regard.  The Minister of State referenced the hot school meals programme.  I will close my remarks by saying that today is a day when percentages which sound smallish are being identified as great ambitions.  I refer to the 7% year-on-year reductions in emissions and the 2%.  It is easy to say 2% but it deserves acknowledgement.  I know the Minister of State is driving this agenda.  It is a tremendously ambitious target.  If achieved, a reduction of 2% in the fuel poverty rate will, as the Minister of State said, be one of the most important things achieved under the programme for Government.  That is not a question, I am just commending the Minister of State and the Department for taking on this job of work and driving it forward.  Deputy Joe O'Brien is the right man for that job.  I am sorry, I am probably rambling slightly but I did ask a couple of questions during my contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#D00400","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>With regard to priorities for the coming year, I will go back to the fuel poverty side of things, mainly because it is one of the commitments that is a bit scattered and needs someone to pull it together.  Many of the other commitments sit fairly squarely in particular Departments, including many which sit in our own Department of Social Protection.  With regard to other priorities, we will be looking towards budget 2022, building up to it and seeing what we can do.  With regard to the review in 2022, I do not want to predict the time of year at which it will come but I am eager for it to be completed earlier rather than later.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy makes a good point on the well-being indicators.  While I talk a lot about the 2%, other indicators beyond just income are used within the roadmap.  On the education side of things, there is a target in respect of retention rates, particularly in DEIS schools.  That is a big factor with regard to social inclusion and poverty as well.  We have targets for employment engagement for people with a disability.  These are particularly important.  Active citizenship rates are also included, as is housing quality.  There are other markers included beyond income.  These do tally somewhat with the well-being indicators the Deputy has mentioned.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned specific targeting and general social welfare payments.  We need to do both.  We will follow the research and the data but the gap about which we are talking and the target we wish to reach will require something dramatic.  We need to target those three groups which are just way above the average level and we need to consider the general base rates as well.<\/p> <p>  On the civil engagement side of things, it is important to mention that in a few weeks' time, from 12 to 16 April, we are holding the annual social inclusion forum virtually.  It is usually held in person.  Even as we speak, last week and this week, both the European Anti Poverty Network Ireland and Community Work Ireland have been talking to local community groups across the country about the content and shape of that week.  I will certainly listen to and attend as many of the workshops as I can.  The civil engagement side of things is really central in how we prioritise.  I will take at least some of my lead with regard to prioritisation from what comes out of that forum.  I think I have touched on most of the Deputy's points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#E00200","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1459,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his statement and for the work that is going on.  I wish him well as chair of the implementation group.  I will draw attention to a couple of broader issues which I would like to address.  In the statement, it is said that the State needs to play a role in delivering supports and services.  It also says that it should not seek to displace the community and voluntary sector and talks about focusing on enhancing the existing community and statutory partnerships, saying that such partnerships are essential for better outcomes for communities and so on.  It also says the Government is committed to strengthening partnerships.  Many of those community, voluntary and charity sector bodies and agencies have never had their full funding restored.  There have also been issues with some of the workers.  I met some workers who were formerly section 39 workers and who are now section 56 workers.  These were transferred to Tusla but have never had their salaries restored.  As chair, will the Minister of State be able to bring that up with the group?  I know this is not related directly to his brief, but these people are providing really essential services in the community and it is unfair that section 39 workers will have their salaries restored by the end of 2022 while these people have been somehow forgotten.<\/p> <p>  Covid was talked about as being a leveller but, when we look at the information and statistics being made available every day, we can see that those in working-class communities have been hit much harder by the virus and its impacts.  We need to ensure that the services, agencies and charities supporting and helping these communities are reinforced.  I would like to see funding restored to some of those.  There is also a real case to increase this funding.<\/p> <p>  Towards the end, on the final page of the statement, there is something that really concerns me.  It reads, \"The coming years will no doubt bring more challenges and difficult choices as the country and the economy and society finds its way through this pandemic and out the other side.\"  I am concerned because the last time we were in such circumstances and when the State coffers were under severe pressure, was during the collapse of the so-called Celtic tiger.  Unfortunately, the community, voluntary and charity sector took the brunt of the cuts, as did the workers.  Is there a commitment not to go back to those days when the first instinct was to cut services for those most disadvantaged, those most vulnerable and those in working-class constituencies?<\/p><p>I hope that statement is not something that will come to pass for those communities.<\/p><p> I refer to community development projects.  What was said is welcome.  Many communities are on the margins, such as Travellers, the Roma community and people who have come into this country.  I have had a lot of meetings with people who have talked about funding.  Many organisations are looking for multiannual funding which would allow them to plan.  The documentation states that the Department is looking for people to come forward with three-year plans.  However, there is only a guarantee of funding for one year.  That creates huge difficulties for agencies and people.  How can one get someone who is full of energy to leave a position and join another project which they may want to work with when he or she is only guaranteed a one-year contract even though the Department is looking for three-year plans?<\/p><p> A lot of community and voluntary groups come to me to talk about the fact that there are virtually no training or capital budgets.  We are asking community development projects to start up but no capital costs are being covered.  It is something that needs to be addressed.  If we are setting up a new community development project, possibly within an existing community development project or as an add-on or an enhanced part of the work it is doing, we have to think about funding agencies and projects to the fullest extent.  A business would never start up without having some of its costs covered.  That is not the way a business would operate.  I do not think the community sector should operate in that way.<\/p><p> As I said I wish the chair of the group well and look forward to him coming back to the committee.  As Deputy Kerrane said, a meeting twice a year is probably not enough.  If the committee had an opportunity to delve deeply into the issue and ensure the programme is delivered that would be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#E00300","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>Does the Minister want to come back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#F00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>Funding for the community and voluntary sector is very topical.  I attended an event earlier today.  The Wheel in Carmichael recently published a consultation report on the needs of the community and voluntary sector.  Funding was probably at the top in terms of what the needs were.<\/p> <p>  The need for multiannual funding is recognised in our five-year community and voluntary sector strategy.  We have a multiannual funding programme.  It is the support scheme for national organisations.  I understand and accept that is not applicable to everyone and totally accept that the multiannual funding side, or lack thereof, makes it difficult for organisations to plan, attract and retain good people in the long term.  That has been recognised officially and we are working on it.<\/p> <p>  The ongoing difficulty is that we are constrained by an annual Government budgetary situation as well.  Trying to build in multiannual funding is always tricky, but has been done with the SSNO.  I would be interested in growing that funding scheme.<\/p> <p>  I would need to have a conversation with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, about section 39 organisations.  I am interested in setting up meetings with all of the line Ministers regarding the relationships they have with their key community and voluntary organisations.  I would be happy to make the case to him on that.  I know it is an ongoing issue and a report with recommendations was published some time ago.  Interestingly, at the event I attended today section 39 organisations and the Catherine Day report were mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Regarding my communications with other Ministers on this, I wish to flag that last month I wrote to all Ministers to ask them about their level of engagement with community and voluntary organisations, with a view to benchmarking, to use the word that was used in a different context, and measuring the level and quality of engagement.  That was all with a view to bulking that up.  <\/p> <p>  A big part of my job is liaising with other Ministers to try to broaden and deepen their understanding and appreciation of the community and voluntary sector.  The exercise I have started is something I will carry out every year.  Bilateral meetings will also form part of that in order to build understanding across Government.<\/p> <p>  To be fair, the Deputy mentioned that in the previous recession the community and voluntary sector took a hit.  There is a lot of evidence already to suggest that the approach this time will be different.  The clear manifestation of that is the fact that last year the stability fund involved a significant commitment of &euro;45 million to the sector.  That was followed up by an additional &euro;10 million in the budget.  Last month it was announced that we will open a new scheme, on a smaller scale, totalling &euro;10 million this year.  I can say all of the things I want, but money is being put in place and the evidence is there in terms of there being a different approach this time to the community and voluntary sector.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on only one year of funding being granted for community development projects.  He mentioned training budgets.  In respect of the five-year community and voluntary sector strategy, there is a cross-sectoral group comprising different Department officials and representatives from the community and voluntary sector.  It prioritised three things to focus on this year.  At the top of that list was training.  Within that area, it prioritised three areas in particular.  The first is community organisations that are volunteer-based and board members of community and voluntary organisations, because there is an issue with retaining board members, board members feeling stretched and so on.  Another strand is LCDCs, in particular the PPN members.<\/p> <p>  The volunteering strategy published last year commits to supports.  Again, there was quite a significant bump in funding for volunteering last year.  It is the best bang for buck one can get in terms of investment in volunteering.  This is not just a phrase.  The evidence is there to show that a small amount of money put into volunteering will reap multiples in terms of benefits.  We are in a good place in terms of having a full volunteering centre in each county by the end of this year and a set of policies and support around that.  Volunteering Ireland in key in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to flag the fact that the strategy was launched last year but the implementation group has started to meet.  The implementation phase of the strategy has started and supports and training are part of that.  I ask the Deputy to shout if I have not covered any of the issues he has raised, but from my notes here I believe I have touched on most things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#F00300","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1463,"content":"<p>I wish to come back in on one issue.

It has been mentioned by all members of the committee but it is always important to say thanks because what they have gone through has been considerable.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that other members raised the issue of a living wage and that the Minister of State referenced it too.  It is important that our conversations are about a living wage rather than about a minimum wage with a minimal increase.  I welcome the fact he is talking about a living wage, which we all should be talking about.<\/p> <p>  The national childcare scheme was referenced.  What is the status of that?  Covid has probably taken over in importance, given that many people are working from home, but pre-Covid it was a big issue for many people, particularly in the commuting counties where people were paying almost a second mortgage in childcare costs.  That cannot continue for these people when we emerge from Covid.  They get up very early in the morning and take their children to cr&egrave;ches far away to avail of childcare services.  Where does that fit into the report and will the Minister of State provide an update on it?<\/p> <p>  There have been a couple of conversations about providing a one-stop shop for bereavement supports.  Has the Minister of State considered that?  It has been raised in various conversations but particularly during Covid, it has been a big issue for many people trying to avail of different aspects of the bereavement process.  What is the status of that?<\/p> <p>  I return to the issue of carer's allowance.  The measures in the most recent budget were welcome but the carer's means test has not been updated since 2008.  I continue to hear from people who cannot avail of the carer's allowance.  To give a quick example, I was recently contacted by a woman who had to give up work to care for her husband.  The couple still have a mortgage and are trying to live off a carer's allowance payment, which is simply not good enough to cover a mortgage.  That is being replicated throughout the country, with estimates suggesting that about 30,000 people are outside the threshold for the carer's allowance but are giving care.  We have to reconsider the means test because the issue is affecting so many people.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State and some members mentioned food poverty.  One issue I have come across during the pandemic relates to community groups who have sprung up and are providing food parcels to people throughout rural Ireland.  Many such community groups have found people who were not known to them before and who are living by themselves in isolation.  This has been a terrific response by the groups to help these people out.  The Minister of State mentioned the meals on wheels campaign and indicated he has been talking to its representatives.  I am aware the HSE has partially funded some of those meals but I ask him to re-examine the matter.  These community groups have sprung up in response to the pandemic.  Some of them provide 80 or 90 meals a day in various corners of County Kildare, where I am from, but it is happening in every county.  Perhaps the Minister of State will examine that issue and include the groups in the meals on wheels campaign he mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, I welcome the work it does in my county.  The current SICAP will end in 2022 and there is &euro;39 million for 2021.  What plans are there for the new SICAP?  What is the status of it?<\/p> <p>  I raise the issue of what were formerly referred to as RAPID areas.  These are socially deprived areas, which I have worked in for a long time.  In my opinion and that of many others, we need to target those areas heavily.  Can that issue be examined?  We need to look at it.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the extension of the CE schemes.  I have come across people in CE schemes whose medical cards had been cancelled because they could not provide an end date, and in fairness to the Minister of State, he resolved that issue by extending the scheme.  It is a simple issue but it is very important for those in the scheme.  Nevertheless, we continue to have problems for people who are 61 or 62 years old and are not yet near their pension age but are coming to the end of their CE time.  Are there plans for those people?  They may be three or four years away from drawing down their pension and do great work within their community.  They may have been working in the scheme for six or seven years but may feel they cannot go anywhere else because they are so used to that way of life.  The Minister of State might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Like other members, I wish the Minister of State well.  This is very important work and I look forward to further engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#G00100","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Senator and to viewers on Oireachtas TV.

I thank him for opening with the remark about the staff and I echo it.  The Department and the staff have not only been on the front line throughout the pandemic but adapted extraordinarily quickly and dealt with an extraordinary volume of applications.  The difficulty of that cannot be overstated, so I appreciate the Senator acknowledging that.<\/p> <p>  On the national childcare scheme, I can give the Senator some statistics but if he wants to clarify what information he is seeking, I can revert to him with it.  A total of 92,000 active applications have been submitted, comprising 57,000 income-assessed applications relating to 67,000 children and 34,000 universal applications relating to 36,000 children.  About 3,000 providers have been contracted to provide the national childcare scheme.  I have some further information on it to hand but if the Senator wishes to ask a follow-up question, I will see whether I have what he seeks rather than read through all the information front of me.<\/p> <p>  On the one-stop shop for bereavement supports, if I recall correctly, the Senator's colleague has raised the issue in the D&aacute;il with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I will check with her and get an answer for the Senator.<\/p> <p>  I will take away the Senator's point on the carer's allowance and the means test not having been updated since 2008.<\/p> <p>  On food poverty and the meals on wheels campaign, that too is something I will take on board.  To backtrack a little to my earlier point about writing to the various Departments to see what they are doing in this area, I envisage and hope that out of that we will develop some kind of a working group.  I hope the Department of Health might be involved in that, although I do not want to pre-empt anything, given that the request has not yet been made.  It is at such a forum that I can bring the specific issue of the funding for meals on wheels that the Senator raised.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Senator for mentioning SICAP.  We do not speak enough about it but brilliant work is being done throughout the country.  We are at very early stages of thinking about what the new SICAP might look like but there will be a consultation process on that.  It is something I am personally eager to develop because SICAP has a very significant impact on communities throughout the country and it is important we get the next iteration of it right.  There have been some calls for the current SICAP to be extended because of Covid and we are examining whether that is an option.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that RAPID areas no longer exist in many respects and that they have been replaced to a great extent by the Pobal deprivation index, which is much more detailed in terms of the data used to assess deprivation.  The community enhancement programme has replaced RAPID areas.  The programme grants sums of money annually to local community development committees, which are on the ground and know best where to direct the money.  The committees grant the funding to local groups and to the need as they see it.<\/p> <p>  On the CE schemes and the age group the Senator mentioned, there is the service support stream as well, which can offer options to people in that age group to allow them to continue working to pension age.  My latest update on that was that that allocation for the service support stream places, which allows people to reach pension age, was not fully used, nationally at least.<\/p><p>It can be at local level but there is some scope to trade the allocation, within regions at least.  I am putting on the Senator's radar that the service support stream might be an option for some of the people he mentioned.  I have touched on most of his points but does he want to come back to me on any of them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#G00400","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1471,"content":"<p>No.  I thank the Minister of State.

A lot of ground has been covered so I will be relatively brief.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one key point.  I suspect the Minister of State may agree with me on it but it will be interesting to hear what he has to say.  On allowances and social welfare payments, the jobseeker's allowance was &euro;197 in 2009 a week and today, nearly 13 years later, it is &euro;203 a week.  There is a huge gap there and previous speakers referred to it.  I have a simple question on this issue.  If we are serious about social inclusion, then is a significant increase in that welfare rate not an absolute necessity in this coming year?  I cannot see how all the important things the Minister of State mentioned can be delivered without that type of seismic move.  He used the word \"dramatic\" earlier.  This increase has to happen, otherwise we will end up talking about good intentions again.  Respectfully, I think the Minister of State will agree that is not good enough at this point.  I would like a clear statement from him on what needs to happen to those social welfare rates, given that so little has happened to them over the past decade.<\/p> <p>  I am not entirely happy with how the Department defines poverty.  It is significant that organisations like Social Justice Ireland come up with much higher figures for poverty, such as the figure of 680,000 people, including 200,000 children, living in food poverty.  How will the Minister of State's policy address the key issue of in-work poverty?  In my experience as a trade unionist and, indeed, in my current job, the issue of people who are working for a living but are not managing to earn a living is a massive problem for us.  I will give one simple example.  When we increase the cost of fuel, people on the minimum wage cannot access fuel allowances.  While it might seem that we are covering and protecting people, we are not.  People at the lowest levels of pay do not get any additional money.  I am concerned about how the overall policy will address the issue of in-work poverty because it seems to me that the goalposts have, for the most part, been shifted below the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>  I am intrigued about the seven high-level goals in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025.  The second goal is to ensure work pays and fair pay and conditions for workers.  Can the Minister of State tell us what specific actions the Department has taken in the context of ensuring fair pay and conditions for workers?  It is a genuine, serious question.  When we talk about fair pay and conditions for workers, the elephant in the room is that Ireland, unlike most other countries in the European Union, does not have a right to collective bargaining.  In that context, how does a private sector worker get a pay increase?  It is not there.  We know that, for an awful lot of people, pay has remained static over the past decade.<\/p> <p>  The other problem is that the Government - not the Minister of State personally, I hasten to add - has set its face against collective bargaining.  In fact, it wrote to the European Union only a few weeks back to ask that an upcoming directive be watered down to a recommendation, just in case collective bargaining may be somewhat strengthened.

I will say that very often people have associated financial supports as well, such as an the increase for a qualifying child, child benefit, other supports outside of my Department, such as the housing assistance payment, medical cards and so on.  However, I agree with the Senator that we need to do something significant about the base rate.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's point about in-work poverty, I refer to commitment 20.  We have a target to further improve Ireland's EU ranking for in-work poverty by reducing it to 2%.  This is a real issue and I am glad the Senator has raised it.  This speaks to the issue I raised earlier on having other sub-targets as well, but I recognise in-work poverty is certainly an issue.  From my engagement with officials in the Department, I know they recognise that.  There are also efforts to address it in the context of the working family payment and the threshold relating to it.<\/p> <p>  The living wage is the Senator's main point.  There are things my Department can do but there are also things that other Departments can do.  That is where the living wage and pay rates in general come in.  One of the reasons we have the interdepartmental group is so that we can join the dots with regard to how we support work from an income support point of view in the Department of Social Protection, but also from the wage rate point of view in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p> <p>  Is there something else I have not touched on, brief as my answers were?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#H00500","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>I will be very brief and I appreciate the Minister of State's answer.

The Minister of State has given the impression that he will certainly work well on this and make an all-out effort to try and eliminate poverty, particularly among children.  I saw figures recently which indicated that there are more than 200,000 children in poverty, much of which is food poverty.  The worrying and frightening thing is that if one checks the figures, one can see that poverty is actually rising.  There are up to 50,000 extra children in poverty now compared with nine or ten years ago.  That should not be happening.<\/p> <p>  I will not repeat much of what has been said, but I will make a very strong point about the importance of the school meals service.  Unfortunately, there are households in which children do not get proper meals.  I am not being judgmental of anybody but at least we know schools are providing meals.  Even if the school meals service is not there, schools and teachers are very good.  I have been involved with schools and know for a fact they will make an awful lot of effort if they feel a child is neglected, is not bringing lunch to school or has not had a proper breakfast.  Schools and teachers will pull out all the stops to look after such children.<\/p> <p>  It is very important that this programme was extended.  If children are coming to school and getting meals, at least we know that they are not being totally neglected.  I certainly worry that many more children will be neglected and in food poverty when this lockdown is over.<\/p><p>We all have to work to get rid of child poverty.  It should not be happening in our country.  One of the main measures to achieve this is the programme for giving meals to children in schools.  That is extremely important.  It is shocking to listen to the contributions, including that of the Chair, about the amount of food that is being dumped.  We all say from time to time that no one should go hungry.  There are lots of schemes in place but it would be great if we could do something about all that food that is being dumped.  I am sure it could be used to extend the school meals service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#H00800","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1479,"content":"<p>There seems to be a problem with the connection to the Upper House.

I listened carefully to all of the contributions, which have been positive.  However, one of the objectives is to extend employment opportunities to all who can work.  Once again, and for the 15 millionth time in politics - this is not just directed at the Minister of State but it has been directed at all my colleagues over the years - we have a class of people who will never get or who are unlikely to get commercial employment, who want to work and who make a good contribution when they get opportunities on schemes such as T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme or community employment schemes.  I am wondering if we can collectively plead that this basic right to work, to make a contribution and to get up in the morning with a purpose will be granted.<\/p> <p>  When the T&uacute;s scheme was set up, it was done so backwards to the way it is at the moment.  The idea was that one did three years on a community employment scheme.  Then if one did not get commercial employment through activation, one would move onto a T&uacute;s work scheme where one would be able to effectively continue without being trained into some job one was never likely to get.  All of our community centres, outdoor facilities and so on are maintained by people on these schemes.  This is work that has to be done and it is not work for the sake of work but it gives people a sense of self-worth and, properly done, it also gives them a bit of extra income.  I am begging that this would be looked at because it is the main thing that would help a lot of people who are begging us to stay on schemes when they come to the end of them.  It is not a problem getting people to go on a scheme but it is a problem allowing people to stay on one.<\/p> <p>  I heard the Minister of State's response to the question on RAPID.  I would like to tease this issue out further.  It did not matter what way the statistics were done, the same areas came up.  The Minister of State may remember the famous Trutz Haase index.  On one occasion I had someone from Trutz Haase in the office and I was shown an interesting experiment.  He said it was amazing that if one puts in the areas of the country that buy the fewest tickets from Ticketmaster, it will be more or less coterminous with the RAPID areas.  I told him he was codding, he showed me quite a few areas that I threw at him and it worked more or less perfectly.  The point I am making is that regardless of how one looks at it, the same areas always come to the fore in this regard.  Those areas all have major problems.  That does not mean that individual poverty does not exist in other places but where one gets huge concentrations of disadvantage, that disadvantage feeds itself and creates a massive community of problems beyond the individual.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State would give a commitment that he will come before the committee some day - if the committee invites him and he agrees - to discuss this issue of the urban areas that suffer the most disadvantage and nothing else.  I do not care how we define them because we will wind up with the same areas if we are honest and if we do not start spreading out to everybody.  This was a focused scheme.  Would the Minister of State consider that?<\/p> <p>  I agree with all the points made by the other contributors.  In the past ten years, the nature of supplementary welfare has changed.  Family circumstances can be complex.  Someone in a house could have an income and that household could still be really poor because of family circumstances.  If, for example, one member of a couple is earning money and not giving it over, there can be crisis.  He or she might disappear for a weekend to a hostelry or somewhere.<\/p> <p>  In the old days, the community welfare officer knew the people and had discretion but now it is all done on the basis of an eight-page formula.  There is no discretion to deal with real crisis poverty and with emergencies that arise as was the case in the past.  One could say that maybe there was a leakage of money that should not have been leaked, and maybe there was.  On the other hand, which scenario would we prefer?  Would we prefer that some money got wasted and that we rescued a whole lot of people in dire situations which, on the surface, would not pass the slow means test relating to the current supplementary welfare allowance and that some money would go to waste or that we leave those people absolutely stuck?  We know that the only place those people can go in those really tough situations is to the moneylender.  This is a serious issue and those are my points.  Can the Minister of State keep the answers to two minutes because I have to buzz off and do a television appearance over in Buswells?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#J00500","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1483,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might come back on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021032300002#J00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1484,"content":"<p>I will try my best to keep my answer to two minutes.  On that overall goal of facilitating work for all who can work, there are a number of categories within that where things are happening.  For people with disabilities in particular, there are a couple of Dormant Accounts Fund projects in the Department of Social Protection that are doing good work in that regard.  There are also wage support schemes for people with disabilities and there are thousands of people benefiting from those.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is getting more at community employment schemes here, however.  We recognise at a local level that there are two loose cohorts of people who participate on such schemes.  There are some who are more in the activation space and some who we can classify as in the social inclusion space.  If I recall reading this correctly - I stand open to correction - many of the sponsors liked to retain the fluidity between those two groups.  We should all be reluctant to say that someone might never work in a commercial sense as the Deputy said.  We accept that some people probably never will do so but we must at least ensure that they still have the opportunity to do that.  It is important that they are not prevented from doing that.<\/p><p> On RAPID, I am open to the Deputy's suggestion that we have a more formal discussion but we would need to frame how it would take place.  It may be of interest to him that we are piloting a small number of place based leadership programmes.  One is in Darndale and another in Drogheda, areas experiencing the type of deprivation and social issues to which he referred.  This is about pulling together the agencies already on the ground because while much is being done on the ground, it is often done in silos and people do not talk to each other.  This pilot based leadership scheme is about pulling people together, pooling resources and being more coherent.  It is small and not on the scale of RAPID but as I mentioned to Senator Wall, in terms of the community enhancement programme and the use of the Pobal deprivation index, money is being targeted by  local community and development committees, LCDCs, at a local level as well to community groups.<\/p><p> I risk disagreeing with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the supplementary welfare allowance and community welfare officers.  I understand from the feedback I get that community welfare officers still exercise significant discretion and flexibility.  One hears cases of people not getting the support they hoped for or sought but community welfare officers are about flexibility and discretion.

He was not in politics in 2011 when certain forces got at this and decided there was too much focus on these areas and they were getting too much, despite have always been the most deprived areas in our communities.

On the issue of discretion, an appeal of a community welfare officer's decision was never needed because there was significant flexibility.  That has been tightened up.  I accept the work the CWOs do in the Department of Social Protection is far more flexible than in other areas.  I accept there is an ethos in the Department and among officials of trying to help people out.  Community welfare officers are flexible but the scale of flexibility is far short of the flexibility in the past.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right.  Public money was probably misspent but a great deal of good work was done.  We need to keep an eye on that.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke spoke about the range of supports that are available.  The Citizens Information website is a useful tool for me, as a public representative, and for citizens.  Many people are not tech savvy.  Last week, the Irish Postmasters' Union spoke about the difficult financial situation its members are facing.  It is seeking the introduction of an annual public service obligation for the postmasters.  Postmasters and postmistresses provided a valuable service to people who were eligible for social welfare schemes by making them aware of their eligibility and assisting them in filling out the application form.  It was a successful service.  <\/p><p>In 2018, as the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I gave a commitment to transfer offline services to the post office network.  This service could be provided as part of the Department of Social Protection through postmasters to ensure people are aware of their eligibility for schemes.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to consider the broader issue in the Department.<\/p><p>Many members have already spoken about food poverty which I raised at the start of the meeting.  The Government published its climate action legislation today.  Food poverty and food waste are opposite sides of the same coin.  We are dumping five and a half kilograms per day for each person who finds his or herself in food poverty.  That contradiction must be dealt with.  We have set targets for 2030 and 2050, which I hope we will achieve.  That is the objective of the legislation.  Achieving them will have a minimal impact on our global climate challenge.  However, tackling food waste which, in this country, is the third biggest carbon emitter, would have an impact on our overall global emissions.  Ireland is in an ideal situation as one of the biggest food producers in the world <i>per capita.<\/i>Initiatives such as the FoodCloud initiative have been successful.  The meals on wheels model will be better co-ordinated through Irish Rural Link.  Senator Wall spoke about a voluntary initiative delivering food parcels.  One of the biggest challenges it faces is access to vehicles to distribute the parcels.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has an opportunity to set an international benchmark, working with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to deal with both sides of the challenge, food waste and food poverty, for the benefit of people and the climate challenge we face globally.  I hope the Minister of State will work with the climate side to achieve a reinvigorated approach to this.

Perhaps working with Bord Bia I suggest that every schoolchild receives an eating in season calendar in order to know when various vegetables and fruits are available.  Schoolchildren could then bring a calendar home so that their parents can shop accordingly thus reducing their overall cost of food, reduce the amount of food that is wasted and benefit the growers in north County Dublin.

Some very interesting topics have been raised.  In the past I have worked with the FoodCloud and meals-on-wheels.  Both entities go hand in hand.  I have seen firsthand the amazing resources they supply to the community sector that create magic meals for people, which is phenomenal.  We have a great example of this in Newmarket-on-Fergus, of which members may have heard, but even they cannot keep up with the volume of stuff offered by FoodCloud.  Therefore, greater support must be given to companies like FoodCloud to engage with family resource centres and other areas.  Some secondary schools have fitted kitchens that are perfect for cooking food.  I believe that there are a couple of links missing between food waste and what can be done so we should tackle these.  As we all know, we have a country full of volunteers.  If a community needed hot meals and we gave a shout-out in any community in Ireland one would quickly get people running in the door to help.  Perhaps greater links could be made between food waste and companies like FoodCloud.<\/p><p>I have an interest in food poverty.  According to research conducted by <i>mywaste.ie<\/i>and also research done by the Green Party in green schools even children from a lower socio-economic background threw away food.  So it is not as simple as believing that only well-off people waste food and poorer people do not waste food.  There is an issue with the ridiculous amount of food that can be bought cheaply; it is wasted as it is impossible to eat it all.<\/p><p>On the point raised by the Chairman, work is being done and being piloted by green schools on a food flag as opposed to a travel, energy or water flag.  The aim of the initiative is to teach children to grow food, which many schools are doing anyway, and eat seasonally.  It is terrible that we need to teach adults through their children but pester power works best.  I will talk to the Minister of State about the pilot scheme after the meeting.<\/p><p>The Minister of State does not have an easy station but he came from the community development sector and it is really helpful to have a Minister of State from that realm.

Can the scheme take into account biodiversity and climate issues?  I ask because many of the schemes involve spraying Roundup on weeds, cutting lawns and maintaining green spaces, which is great but I want them to move towards creating aesthetically pleasing spaces that protect people's mental health and are good for the environment and biodiversity.  Greater linkage is necessary because money is being wasted on mowing lawns, pruning trees and cutting hedges.  If we let things grow a bit wilder then it would be a win-win for everybody and save money.<\/p> <p>  In terms of CE schemes, I have been asked by quite a few farmers' wives if their husbands could join their local CE schemes because they are going mad being at home.

Their wives have begged me to arrange for their husbands to be allowed to participate on the schemes for a day or two per week.  Has the Minister of State considered that option?  Many people in rural Ireland experience loneliness and boredom, particularly farmers who live on their own or just with their wives and have no neighbours around.  These farmers would love to join their local CE schemes as it would bring them into towns or villages where they could have a chat with the lads.  Participation in a CE scheme is another way of integrating as opposed to just going to the pub, which we do not have at the moment.  I urge the Minister of State to expand the scheme.

We have a cohort of people here who are contributing to our society and economy, yet do not have legal status.  To return to the point made earlier about community welfare officers, if these people fall on hard times, the only people they can turn to, and who have been quite helpful in some previous cases, are community welfare officers.  These people have been paying tax and PRSI in many instances but because they do not have legal status, they cannot avail of the safety net that is available to every other worker in this country.

Are they agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  This meeting has been convened with representatives from the Licensed Vintners Association, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland for a round-table discussion on the impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality sector.  The witnesses will be joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I welcome: Mr. Donall O&rsquo;Keeffe, CEO, and Mr. Noel Anderson, vice chair, of the Licensed Vintners Association; Mr. Padraig Cribben, chief executive, and Mr. Padraic McGann, national president, of the Vintners Federation of Ireland; Mr. Tim Fenn, CEO, and Ms Elaina Fitzgerald Kane, president, of the Irish Hotels Federation; and Mr. Adrian Cummins, CEO, and Mr. Mark McGowan of the Restaurants Association of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite witnesses to make opening statements.  These will be followed by questions from committee members.  Witnesses are probably aware that the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  I will call on each organisation to deliver their opening statements in the following order: first, the Licensed Vintners Association, second, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, third, the Irish Hotels Federation, and, finally, the Restaurants Association of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I want to advise them of the following in regard to parliamentary privilege.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in the context of the identification of a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses today are attending from outside the precincts of the Leinster House campus, they should please note that there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.<\/p> <p>  I remind members again of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in this public meeting.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask that they use their raise hand buttons when they wish to make a contribution.  I also remind them to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  With all that housekeeping out of the way, I am delighted to welcome our guests to this very important meeting.  As we know, they represent a sector that has been wiped out by Covid-19.  There is no other way to put it.  We are delighted to have them here today to give their statements and witness accounts of the deep crisis the sector finds itself in.  I call on the Licensed Vintners Association to make its opening statement and comments to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#A00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1502,"content":"<p>I want to confirm that Noel Anderson is chairman of the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA.  The LVA is the representative of body for the publicans of Dublin and, pre Covid, employed 12,000 people and accounted for 30% of the national on-trade market.  We appreciate the opportunity to appear in front of the joint committee today and welcome the fact the joint committee recognises the enormous impact of Covid-19 on our sector.  We look forward to answering questions later in the session.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that hospitality and tourism have been hit extraordinarily hard by the pandemic, with the Dublin trade in particular experiencing the longest and most severe lockdown in Europe, as evidenced by the following statistics.  Traditional wet bars, late bars and nightclubs closed on 15 March 2020 and have not traded for a single day since.  As of today, these businesses have been closed for 372 days and, assuming a June or summer reopening, these businesses will have been kept closed for a minimum of 15 months.  Pubs that serve food are currently in their third lockdown and in the 372 days since 15 March last, have only traded for 105 days, or 28%, of that time.<\/p> <p>  We want to talk to the committee about our views on reopening.  We understand specific reopening dates cannot be provided at this time.  However, we are calling on the Government to publicly communicate the circumstances that must apply to allow the full reopening of the hospitality sector.  To our minds, there are four questions, as follows.  What percentage of the adult population will need to be vaccinated?  What level of community transmission will need to apply?  Will it be the case that pubs and hospitality will only be able to reopen for vaccinated customers?  Will the Government confirm that, post vaccination, the previous artificial distinction between traditional wet pubs and pubs that serve food will be eliminated, and that all pubs and other hospitality businesses will be able to open together?  There can be no justification post vaccination, in our view, for keeping wet pubs closed while allowing food pubs and restaurants to reopen.<\/p> <p>  We believe there is a strong case for the extension of financial supports for our sector.  We acknowledge the level of Government support our sector has received to date.  They have provided a real lifeline, with the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, payment in particular being essential in supporting these businesses.  However, we believe a core underlying principle for Government must be recognition of the fact that the hospitality sector will require ongoing Government financial supports post reopening in light of the extended lockdown.<\/p> <p>  We believe these supports should fall under the following headings.  First, there should be an immediate reopening support and restart grant, taking account of the extended closures the sector has endured.  We call for these payments to be set at a level double to the restart plus grant payment that businesses received last summer.  We believe short-term recovery supports are required for the immediate six to nine months after reopening.  There are three priorities in this regard: the extension of the  employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to 31 March 2022 to allow businesses return to viability and retain and grow jobs; the ongoing payment of CRSS to those businesses which cannot generate more than 25% of their average 2019 turnover because of any ongoing public health restrictions; and the third area for Government support should be a waiver of commercial rates for all licensed premises through to 31 March 2022.  Combined, these three measures are crucial to support the industry&rsquo;s ability to retain staff and, over time, to rebuild employment levels in our sector.  It must be a strategic priority for the Government to reduce youth unemployment across the country and our sector is well placed to do that.  Longer term, we seek supports to improve viability.  In that regard, we seek the retention of the 9% VAT rate right through to the end of 2025.<\/p> <p>  We would appreciate the joint committee&rsquo;s support in recommending the following to Government: first, the extension of those financial supports I have outlined; second, the clarification on reopening scenarios for our members and what, if any, public health restrictions might apply post vaccination; and, third, confirmation that there can be no justification for keeping wet pubs closed while allowing other parts of the hospitality sector to trade in summer 2021.  I thank members for their attention.  We would welcome any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Keeffe for that very informative presentation.

First, we express our deepest sympathy and condolences to those who have lost loved ones to the pandemic over the past year.  From the outset, we have urged all our members to support and adhere to the public health measures in place at any given time, and we continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  We represent 4,000 family-owned and family-run small businesses in every parish, town and city outside County Dublin.  The majority of those businesses, as Mr. O'Keeffe outlined, have been closed for over a year, except for a two-week trading period in September and for those that have a food operation.  It is not just those families who are suffering, it is also their staff, the musicians who play on the premises, the comedians who perform at the venues, the large and small suppliers, local and national, of both food and drink, and the service people who ensure refrigeration and other services are running to required standards.  The list is endless.  Members and those dependent on them for their livelihood are suffering both financially and mentally.<\/p> <p>  No business can be financially healthy if closed for a full year.  Yes, the Government's supports have been welcome and helpful, but they are a long way short of meeting the ongoing outflows of cash.  That is before we look at financing and banking activity.  Some of the banks, despite their soft public words, are certainly not being supportive to the level required.  What is required from a financial point of view?  Currently, there is a need for a doubling of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, to help businesses to be in place when reopening happens.  A substantial restart grant will have to be put in place prior to reopening.  By \"substantial\" I mean double the restart grant plus of 2020.  On reopening, there must be an extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, until the end of March next year, an extension of the CRSS for those businesses categorised as able to open but trading at less than 25%, an extension of the waiver on commercial rates until March 2022, an extension of the 9% VAT rate to 2025 and, in particular, a system of making finance available to those who want it at very low interest rates over a ten-year period but outside the main banking structures.<\/p> <p>  The past year has been very challenging mentally.  Publicans, by their nature, are used to dealing and mixing with people.  When one combines this with the financial losses and concerns and worries, it is not a good recipe.  The pressures have been exacerbated by a lack of clear messaging over the past year from the Government.  On a number of occasions publicans were ready to open, with stock in place at serious cost and staff ready, only for the rug to be pulled at the last minute.  At a time when the Government was advising members of the public to mind their mental health, it was the cause of adverse mental health effects in this sector.  The artificial divide between food and non-food pubs also created unnecessary divisions and pressures.<\/p> <p>  The sector now needs a clear roadmap outlining the conditions that must be in place for reopening, including the levels of vaccination, community transmission, hospitalisation and so forth.  It is a roadmap, not dates.  Hope is necessary, and there is none at present.  Such a roadmap would provide hope and would help to reduce stress levels.  In addition, we must have a clear statement from the Government that all hospitality outlets will be allowed to open at the same time, under the same conditions and subject to the same sanctions.  There must be no more divide between food and non-food outlets.<\/p> <p>  The challenges have been, and are, great.  The sector has been impacted more than most.  However, with the proper supports, as I have outlined, and a clear roadmap we will emerge at the other side ready and willing to be the hub in the community again, to be an employer again, particularly of young people, to be the provider of opportunities to musicians and entertainers again and to playing an integral part in a recovering tourism offering.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee for the opportunity to outline our position.  We hope the committee will impress upon the Government the need for both the financial supports I outlined and the roadmap.  We are willing to address any questions members have at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>Thank you for that informative presentation.

The Irish Hotels Federation welcomes this opportunity to address the joint committee on the impact of Covid-19.  Public health is always the first priority for hotels and guest houses, and we reiterate our full support for the Government in the task of suppressing Covid-19.  We thank the Government for the supports that have been put in place to help our industry.  They are making an enormous difference to our prospects for survival and recovery, as well as to the 270,000 people whose livelihoods we are trying to protect and restore.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has had a catastrophic impact on our industry, manifesting itself in substantial job lay-offs, revenue losses and a significant reduction in the financial reserves.  We estimate that revenue across the hotel sector fell by more than &euro;2.5 billion last year, an unprecedented drop of 60%, and the immediate outlook remains exceptionally challenging this year, with record low business levels on our books due to the high level of uncertainty about reopening.  Key to restoring the livelihoods of 270,000 people who worked in our industry before the pandemic is the survival of the businesses that can drive recovery, but additional financial supports and measures are required to achieve this.  The investment from the Government is small relative to the malaise of enduring unemployment and can be offset quickly by a reduction in unemployment supports.<\/p> <p>  The key Government supports required are: extending the EWSS and the local authority rates waiver until the end of March 2022; a doubling of the CRSS payments irrespective of the level of Covid restrictions, as well as removing the current &euro;5,000 weekly cap; a new restart grant that is double last year's payment; extending tax warehousing and deferring payback by one year; a clear commitment to retain the 9% VAT rate until at least 2025; a 70% refund of energy and pass-through charges.  Key banking and finance measures are also required.  The Government must ask the regulator and banks to take a longer-term view in their approach to our sector by providing bank loan moratoria and employee mortgage deferments.  The future growth loan scheme should also be reactivated.  Some businesses will require recapitalisation when the pandemic is over.  Consideration should be given to providing equity and debt finance incentives to see our industry into full recovery.<\/p> <p>  Prior to the Covid pandemic, our industry supported one in ten of all Irish jobs, with 70% of those jobs outside Dublin.  In some cases, entire communities are dependent on tourism.  In the aftermath of the last financial crisis, tourism was the number one creator of jobs.  We want to play our part in Ireland's recovery but can only do so with the Government's continued supports.  We will be happy to answer any questions the members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by the president of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Mr. Mark McGowan.<\/p> <p>  As we are all aware, Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on lives, livelihoods and society in general.  Some 4,588 people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 and the association's sympathies go to their families and loved ones.  We also think about the 280,000 people who work in hospitality and tourism and who have had their lives turned upside down.<\/p><p>Half of those employed in hospitality work in restaurants, caf&eacute;s and pubs that serve food.  We are here today to offer insight on how Covid-19 has impacted upon the restaurant and food service sector and to propose supports for the survival of a sector which has had restricted trading for more than a year now.  Let us be very clear that we trust the medical advisers.  We do not want to open before it is safe to do so.  We are looking for the metrics on how we can reopen our businesses safely and the plan that will allow us to see light at the end of the tunnel.  <\/p><p> Hospitality businesses are on the brink of collapse.  Some 50% of restaurants face permanent closure.  Reopening our businesses viably with indoor dining is our first priority.  The narrative of a summer outdoors does not work for restaurants.  We need a plan to re-employ staff and, above all, our industry needs hope.  Current business supports do not go far enough for our industry.  Continuation of the EWSS at the current rate is crucial.  The Covid recovery support scheme must be extended to include level 3 restrictions and the current rate doubled to cover fixed costs.  Businesses previously excluded due to a lack of fixed premises, such as contract and event caterers, must be included in financial supports going forward.  A restart grant equivalent to eight weeks of CRSS is needed for reopening costs.  The commercial rates waiver must be extended until the end of 2021 and the current VAT rate of 9% must remain in place until 2025.  <\/p><p> As we start on the road to recovery, we have a number of challenges.  There is little to no payment on business interruption from insurance claims.  Commercial landlords are seeking full rents for the period of closure with some charging interest on arrears, to add to the misery restaurant owners are going through at present.  Utility providers are disconnecting services to restaurants and hospitality businesses.  The banking sector is blacklisting hospitality businesses and workers by way of declining mortgages and loan applications.  Local authorities are issuing commercial rates bills while businesses are in lockdown, having traded for a maximum of 64 days since last March.  With only 20% of restaurants able to avail of outdoor dining, the current regime is wrapped in red tape, major associated costs and extreme restrictions.  There is no restaurant or gastropub representation on the boards of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland or the tourism recovery oversight group.  The chef apprenticeship scheme is cost-prohibitive with very little output of qualified apprentices based on the size and scale of the industry.  Finally, there is a lack of a joined-up approach by State bodies with responsibility for tourism and hospitality.  <\/p><p> Urgent action is needed to ensure the restaurant and hospitality sector survives.

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  I fully support them and all their members.  Since I am from Cork South-West, a constituency that relies very heavily on tourism, I am well aware of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their sectors.  This year's St. Patrick's Day really rammed home how devastating an impact it had.  For the second St. Patrick's Day in a row, and for the second week in two consecutive years, pubs, restaurants and pubs that serve food were closed.  The enormous impact the pandemic has had on the sector really hit home.  It left me with a real sense of melancholy.  It also reaffirmed that we really need to step in, as a Government, to save incredible businesses that were and are viable.<\/p> <p>  It is really encouraging that despite the fact the witnesses represent slightly different sectors, the requests are clear and consistent.  These include the continuation of the EWSS and the increase to, and continuation and extension of, the CRSS to include more businesses.  We have to get behind and support the need for another restart grant, which is coming across quite clearly, the extension of the 9% VAT rate until 2025 and the rates waiver extension, until the end of the year at the very least. <\/p> <p>  A couple of the witnesses have clearly pointed to the idea of a roadmap.  In meetings with several sectors, most recently with the Cork south-west hotels groups, one statement that really hit home is that businesses crave certainty.  At the moment, they do not have that.  We need to step up to the mark, provide that certainty and roadmap and get rid of the mixed messaging which has done no one any favours.  <\/p> <p>  The representatives touched on banking and finance and to make it easier to decide who will answer, I will go to the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, on this one.  Would a standard banking approach be welcome?  My understanding, after speaking to hotels, is that there is a complete variance in approach from different banks on the terms they discuss with businesses.  We had a scenario where there was a blanket moratorium on repayments for a period, which was really helpful, but after that businesses were left to fend for themselves.  Do we need to grab the banks by the scruff of the neck, for want of a better term, and lay down a standard approach for dealing with businesses in providing finance?  We need to get rid of the idea these businesses are not viable because they have been viable and will be again.  We need to look again at a moratorium on payments and how to deal with payments.  That is a question for the Irish Hotels Federation.<\/p> <p>  On the voucher scheme, I will put an idea to the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  I spoke previously about the idea of a voucher scheme.  I suggested a voucher scheme for those who were over 65 and had received the vaccine.  I must say it received a mixed response but the response from the hospitality sector was quite positive.  I am quite confident that July and August will be very strong for the hospitality sector but after that, in September, October and November, there are fears of a bleak cliff edge.  A voucher scheme does not have to be for the over-65s.  It can be broadened to include much more but it is clear that the stay and spend scheme did not work.  There was only a 0.2% uptake because it was only a tax relief.  People were not willing to take it up because of the way it was structured but putting a &euro;100 or &euro;150 voucher in people's hands would really make a difference.  I would love to hear the witnesses' opinion on whether something like that would work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#C00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1512,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy he only has a minute and a half left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#C00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1513,"content":"<p>My last question is on insurance.

The State agency with responsibility for tourism development is F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but it does not have responsibility for hospitality.

I was initially going to ask what engagement there has been with the Government on additional support and long-term grants but going on what has been said, it seems there has not been much clarity or meat put on the bones with the detail of what will be forthcoming.<\/p> <p>  I think I heard correctly when the Restaurants Association of Ireland indicated that it favours direct grants, particularly with respect to outdoor dining.  The previous speaker mentioned that this is Ireland and one cannot necessarily sit out even in the summer months and be guaranteed good weather.  Has there been any confirmation from the Minister or the Government on direct grants for outdoor dining?<\/p> <p>  Is there a restaurant or pub representative on the tourism recovery oversight group?  Given the current circumstances, it might be welcome if that were the case.  As a committee, I ask that we write to the Minister asking her to consider appointing somebody to the group from either the restaurant or pub groups, given our current circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Have F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland been helping the restaurant and hospitality sector or could they do more to help?  In his opening statement, Mr. O'Keeffe posed questions about data and the circumstances that would govern pubs reopening, particularly in the context of the percentage of the population vaccinated, etc.  That would be useful information and it would allow the groups to plan for when the time comes.<\/p><p>I suggest that as a committee we write to the relevant Ministers, asking them to furnish us with that sort of information, which clearly every single sector represented here today is crying out for.  <\/p><p> I have a question on the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.

Has there been an indication that it will be available to businesses reopening this summer?  I will leave it at that.  I have one final question.  As was mentioned, we proposed a voucher scheme to the Government last year, but instead it chose to go with a scheme that turned out to be a flop.  I ask each representative to answer on a \"yes\" or \"no\" basis whether they would be in favour of a voucher scheme for this summer to encourage tourism and people to eat out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#D01000","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1528,"content":"<p>There is a little over two minutes remaining.

There are two issues that the committee should bear in mind.  The first is that the artificial limit of 15 has no commercial relevance; it is not viable for us.  We firmly believe that the limit should be related to the outdoor space available, socially distanced.  If a premises has a lot of outdoor space, it should be able to take a large amount of customers.  If it has limited space, then unfortunately it should only be able to take a limited number of customers.  It is not commercially viable to open for food business for 15 customers when a chef, waiting staff and potentially bar staff have to be brought on board.  The limit should be related to the space available.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that outdoor dining applies to less than 10% of the pub trade in Dublin.  It is essentially closure by another name.  While we welcome the opportunity to trade outdoors, it must be noted that the vast majority of pubs in our capital city will not have an opportunity to trade in that scenario.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1531,"content":"<p>In respect of the CRSS, it is promised to run until the end of June.  In our own hotel, we are able to apply for the full value of the scheme, which is &euro;5,000.  To give the Deputy a sense of where that money goes, it is used to pay insurance and does not even cover light and heating costs.  There are also other expenses in respect of maintenance, contracts, etc..  Our light and heating costs are around &euro;3,000 per week, but of that, 53% is made up of pass through charges, which are Government levies, and is a huge proportion.  While we might be getting an inflow of &euro;5,000, equally &euro;1,500 is going out, so the net gain is essentially &euro;3,500 per week.<\/p> <p>  The cash burn is immense.  To give the Deputy a sense of it, when we talk about reopening grants, we were not even closed for the six-week period.  Our own hotel in Adare was open for essential workers.  Even though we were open for those six weeks, it will still cost us &euro;120,000 to actually reopen in earnest.  I fully appreciate all the reasons we, like the rest of the country, had to close in the week after Christmas, but there was an additional loss of &euro;20,000 in terms of stock, etc.  That will give the Deputy a sense of it.<\/p> <p>  The other question that she asked concerns the voucher scheme.  We absolutely support any system that stimulates demand.  However, there are lessons to be learned from the UK in its approach.  It included everyone, happened at source and also applied to off-peak times.  That is something of which we should be mindful.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the months of July and August.  In the context of hotels, only 21% of bedrooms are booked at this point in time.  We have had no net gains in the last three weeks, as anything that has been gained has been offset by cancellations.  Therefore we are not looking at a buoyant summer ahead.  In fact, it is fair to say that there is an acute lack of hope.  For some, it is the hope of a staycation, and for others it is the hope of bridal couples who want to get married after setting the date for the fifth time.  However, for the 270,000 people in tourism and hospitality, their livelihoods are very much on hold as part of this pandemic.  We should never lose sight of our goal.

It was budgeted to cost the Exchequer &euro;27 million.  My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, submitted a parliamentary question on this issue and the figures were very low.  I believe the related expenditure was around &euro;9,200,000.  It was far less than had been budgeted.  Obviously, we have been in lockdown.

In other words, landlords are running the restaurants.  That put a bit of fear in me.  Mr. Cummins mentioned utility companies imposing high bills and commercial landlords seeking full payments.  These all seem like warning signs.  It is important going forward that the Government gives full supports, not only financially, in getting tourism up and running.  I come from Dundalk and I think we now appreciate what hotels, pubs and restaurants do considering the amount the queues I see outside takeaways in the lashing rain or outside pubs taking away drinks and everything else.

They support most of the hurling and football teams and all sorts of activities in communities.  It is a real eye-opener today to hear them all, and in such bad circumstances.  We hear them.  Regulation of the banks is most important.  A moratorium has to come in and there should also be a moratorium on rents.  I was contacted by a young couple who signed a contract at the beginning of March.  I visited them the other day and they are &euro;50,000 in debt.  It is terrible.<\/p> <p>  In my area, we have not come across the likes of the seasonal restaurants.  They are in real trouble because they have only a couple of months to make a year's profit.  That should be looked at as well.  Many people who opened their businesses just after March were not entitled to the CRSS, so that should be looked at, and the &euro;55,000 turnover threshold should be looked at as well.  It should definitely be reduced for the CRSS obligation.<\/p> <p>  I have questions for those representing the restaurants.  They said they wanted a restart grant for eight weeks.  Can they give me more detail on this?  What are the reopening costs restaurants face?  The licensed vintners said they had staff retention issues.  Could they give us more details on that?

People have to get on with their lives and they are moving to those sectors where there are employment opportunities.  Hospitality is losing staff to the retail sector and distribution in particular.  We expect to lose many staff to construction if it reopens in April before us.

I can only imagine the difficulties of those directly involved in business are facing.

The committee needs to stress the need for the EWSS to be extended in the national recovery plan.  We must make clear for the staff of hotels and pubs that open that we should consider extending the EWSS until the end of the year or, at least, until businesses are back on their feet.  I echo Ms Fitzgerald Kane's concerns on the cap on the CRSS.<\/p> <p>  Ms Fitzgerald Kane is right that the witnesses are involved in a people business.  This is not about bricks and mortar but people.  With some exceptions, they have not had people on the ground for the best part of a year.

What lead-in period will be required to upskill and train staff?<\/p> <p>  I refer to what Mr. Cribben stated at the start.  It is about giving targets more than giving hope.  The difficulty for the Government is that it is dealing with many moving parts.  Would the witnesses accept a scenario in which the Government signalled that the hospitality sector would open on 15 June, subject to certain criteria, including the number of hospitalisations, the R rate and mutations?  Would they be happy to have the sector open if clear criteria were set out?  However, if we were going in the wrong direction one or two weeks before that, the opening date could be postponed.

They made very compelling presentations outlining how difficult this period has been for the sector.  I assure them that there is a very deep awareness in Fine Gael of the challenges the sector has faced in the recent past and is likely to face in the coming months.  This subject is discussed at length at our parliamentary party meetings.  We will be having another such meeting this evening at 5.30 p.m. and I expect it will be discussed yet again.  We have a group of Deputies and Senators who are acutely aware of the challenges the sector faces and who represent both urban and rural Ireland.  I assure the witnesses that I will be advocating that any of the supports that are critical to the survival of the sector remain in place until such time as they are no longer required and there would be significant support for that within my party.  If one looks at the response of the Government to date, one could argue that it has done an excellent job in extending supports that are unique to the sector represented by the witnesses.  I have received many representations from other sectors seeking access to similar supports but that is simply not possible at this time in the context of the resources available to us.  It has been acknowledged by the Government that the sector is the worst impacted of all and the supports that have been extended to it reflect that.<\/p> <p>  I support the call for this committee to advocate for the sector to have immediate representation on the tourism recovery oversight group.  The sector is, by definition, an integral part of our tourism offering and always has been.  I know from work done by the Vintners Federation of Ireland and others how important our pubs, restaurants and hotels are in attracting tourists from around the world.  It is almost a no-brainer and would could ask why anyone would need to do research on that question.  I assure the witnesses that they will have my support in their efforts to gain immediate representation on the tourism recovery group.  Furthermore, they will have my support for Mr. Cummin's suggestion that they would have seats on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in the longer term.  If an entity is established to determine how we recover and support our tourism sector and the hospitality sector is not represented on it, that must be resolved quickly.<\/p> <p>  If not today, perhaps Mr. Cummins and I could have a conversation in the near future on the chef apprenticeship scheme, which he described as being cost prohibitive.  I know from speaking to the current Minister for Education and to previous Ministers in that role that there is very significant ambition in the Department to enhance our apprenticeship opportunities.  If Mr. Cummins is arguing that the apprenticeship process as it applies to his industry is cost prohibitive, I would like to learn more and I thank Mr. Cummins for making that information available to us.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the voucher scheme that was established last year has not succeeded in doing what was intended.  Mr. McGann made the point earlier that we should find a way to use technology to allow for the seamless transfer of the voucher to the intended recipients in the sector.  That is something we should explore in the short rather than the long term.  The supports that are already in place are financial, in the main, including the wage subsidy schemes, rates waivers, the CRSS and the restart grant.  Are there any other supports, apart from financial, that we could provide to the sector, perhaps in the regulatory space, that would help it to return to business and a successful trading model as quickly as possible?  Is there anything that can be done within the regulatory environment that would make that process more straight forward?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I assure the witnesses that they have my absolute support and that of the Fine Gael Party in negotiating what are uncharted waters for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#J00800","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cannon.

An apprenticeship scheme is very prohibitive from a cost basis because when an apprentice goes to college, the employer has to pay the apprentice while he or she is there.  In other apprenticeship schemes, the State covers that cost.  The cost can be between &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000, depending on the number of days the apprentice is in college.  It is very cost inefficient for us and is not fit for purpose.  We need to look at it from an efficiency point of view.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the regulatory environment, there are 22 different licences that we must deal with in the restaurant industry.  One example is the outdoor seating licence.  Applications for that licence should be moved online, the process should be uniform across the country and the fees for same should be waived during this crisis.  We can determine how to reintroduce those fees in the future.  Business improvement districts levies should be waived.  Indeed, all such levies should be abolished while we are in this crisis.

An 80-bedroom hotel could be paying &euro;2,500 per week in pass-through charges for water and electricity.  That amounts to basically recycling the CRSS money.

One is specific to the Central Bank, as financial regulator.  We met representatives from the bank in January and suggested that while our sector remains in level 5 lockdown or, heaven forbid, enters level 5 lockdown in the future, an automatic mortgage payment break should be put in place.  The financial response last April was very good because a sector-wide and industry-wide mortgage payment break system was put in place for six months while we were closed.  It is now considered on a case-by-case basis.  The entire industry, spanning pubs, restaurants and hotels, is in level 5 lockdown.  A regulatory solution to provide for that would be that, during a level 5 lockdown, any business should automatically qualify for a mortgage payment break for as long as it endures.<\/p> <p>  My second point in response to Deputy Cannon's question on the regulatory framework for recovery is that, clearly, the wet bars have been the worst affected, but the late bars and nightclubs have been almost as badly affected and are facing potentially a slower reopening.  The special exemption order costs are enormous.  The regulatory framework around late trading is prohibitive, bureaucratic and expensive.  We know the Government is about to embark on a process to re-examine late trading conditions.  We certainly believe there is an extraordinary strong case to be made for making that far more business friendly and allowing the late bar and nightclub sector an opportunity to recover from the ferocious closure that they have endured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1589,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Fenn wish to come in on that point?

Also, I thank those who contacted us in the past day or two ahead of the meeting.  We had the opportunity yesterday to raise some of these points, as I did, with the Minister with responsibility for tourism who was in the Seanad yesterday for a two-hour debate on issues relating to the hospitality and tourism measures.  We were able to bring to her attention the demands that have been laid out in respect of the CRSS payments, the commitment to the 9% VAT rate, rates waivers and so forth.  I brought those directly to her attention yesterday.  Also, and this is the crucial part, in terms of the roadmap, Mr. Anderson and others have spoken about the fact that tensions are undoubtedly rising with people wanting to get back trading.  It is not about just the financial supports any more.  People want to start trading as well.  I would ask the three representative bodies about that.  Starting with the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the points made by Mr. O'Keeffe and Mr. Cribben, during the previous lockdowns we saw a divergence between the way Dublin was handled and they way the rest of the country was handled.  There are a few reasons for this.  One related to the different rates of the growth of the virus in Dublin versus other areas.  Mr. Anderson alluded to the crazy situation of pubs that serve food being treated differently from those that do not serve food, which only led to ludicrous scenarios, especially down the country, with pubs suddenly operating pop-up pizza parlours and so forth.  That is nonsense and needs to be hit on the head straight away.<\/p> <p>  Is there a joint approach on the part of the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association towards addressing this?  The last thing I want is a divergence between the way Dublin is handled and the way the rest of the country is dealt with in the context of that roadmap.  Undoubtedly, there is a difference between them even in the layout of pubs.  Mr. O'Keeffe alluded to this point and said it should be done on the basis of space.  For example, Mr. Anderson's pub, Lemon &amp;amp; Duke, which is located down the road from these Houses and which we frequent, would be very different from the layout of my local pubs back home in Navan, Paddy Fitzsimon's or P. Clarke's Bar in Navan, which Mr. Cribben would know well.  They are very different pubs.  In terms of trying to get a one size fits all solution for all pubs around the country, do the Licensed Vintners Association and the Vintners Federation of Ireland have a joint approach to dealing with the Government when they get the opportunity to lobby?<\/p> <p>  On restaurants, I agree with what Mr. Cummins said 100%.  He said 20% of them are only equipped for outdoor dining, which is interesting.  As Mr. Cribben said, one is as liable to get a hailstone shower as a burst of sunshine.  We dealt previously with the VAT rate when it was increased.  Mr. Cummins stated that an increase in the rate would put people in the sector in a precarious position.  He said 50% were on the verge of collapse.  What is his fear for the members of Restaurants Association of Ireland for the rest of this year?<\/p> <p>  With respect to the Irish Hotels Federation, the Minister touched on the impact of the drop in revenue for the sector many times during yesterday's debate.  Mr. Fenn and Ms Fitzgerald Kane said there was a 60% drop in revenue.  Obviously, the international market is key in the context of visitors coming to the country.  The Minister referred yesterday to the digital green certificate but she made the point that we should not raise hopes about a quick return to international tourism.  She played that down very significantly.  If that is the case, what impact will that have on the revenue of the members of the Irish Hotels Federation if only the domestic market is allowed return for say the next 12 or 24 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#K00500","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1591,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

The remaining 17% was largely driven by concerts and other large events.  As an island nation with a border it is critical that we get this right when it is safe to travel.

I could give myriad numbers, and the witnesses know them all well, as to why we need change.  In Dublin and other urban areas I see a huge need for space and venues.  In many instances, I see people who would run events or who would open a pub or a venue opening cafes instead.<\/p> <p>  We have reached a point where we have approximately 20% of the nightclubs we had 20 years ago.  There were 500 nightclubs in the State and it is down to 100.  God knows what that will be after the pandemic.  Pubs are not growing in numbers either.  It has been referenced here that a number of things need to happen.  The change being spoken about in licensing law reform absolutely needs to happen and businesses need to be given more flexibility.  There is also consumer demand for 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. closing times.  We need pubs, venues and restaurants to embrace the changes that I hope the Government will make.  What is the response of the witnesses to potential changes in opening hours?

We think the special exemption order process in terms of cost and bureaucracy is completely out of date and will be an inhibitor to our recovery.  The detail of how this is reviewed and modernised is very important to us.  The capital city needs later trading to cater for obvious domestic and, please God, tourist demand when we reopen.<\/p> <p>  We note from the comments of the Minister on the proposed licensing reforms that she intends to regularise Sunday hours, something for which we have been calling for many years.  We also note that she intends to provide new formal licensing for cultural venues.  We have some concerns about this to be frank.  We need to see the detail.  We do not want it to be a backdoor into the licensed trade.  There should be one simple rule, which is a level playing field with the same licensing and same costs for all involved in the selling of alcohol.

We have no great objection to renewal or review of the night-time industry.  We should look at why the number of nightclubs has faded over the years.  In 2008, the cost of operating beyond normal closing time went to &euro;410 per night but that was only the commencement of it.  The other big issue, and Mr. Anderson referred to it earlier, was that it became almost impossible to get insurance for running anything that had a dance licence attached to it.  I can give the example of somebody whose insurance was a six-figure sum at &euro;108,000.  He closed his nightclub, which was only running one night per week, and his insurance reduced by two thirds.  Insurers have had an absolute aversion to looking at the night-time economy and anything alcohol related.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Mr. O'Keeffe said about the concept of cultural venues.  We have seen various institutions over the years drive through a coach and four, and where they get an inch they take a mile.  A theatre can offer drinks before, during and after a play and suddenly we find they are doing 21st birthday parties and 40th anniversaries.  This has to be predicated on having the seven day publican's licence.  What is important is that there is consultation before a decision and not consultation after the decision is made.  We will play a positive part in this but it is against the background of knowing there just cannot be entry into the licensed trade by a back door or a side door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1604,"content":"<p>I asked Mr. Cummins to switch his screen back on before he contributes.

I guarantee the witnesses that, as a party, we will be fully supportive of all the support measures needed.<\/p> <p>  It was said earlier that the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, was in the Seanad Chamber yesterday for a number of hours.  That gave us an opportunity to put forward some proposals that were put to us and to re-emphasise the point about the 9% VAT rate.  It is extremely important that that is extended for a number of years.  It built confidence, led to a large number of jobs being created and international visitors in the sector prior to Covid-19 and post the economic crash.  It is a successful model.  It worked ten years ago and it is something we need to put in place and commit to into the future.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Mr. Anderson's comments about the loss of experienced staff.  The numbers were stark and make it difficult for any business to reopen.  I think it was Mr. O'Keeffe who made the point that it is impossible to put a date on it but when a certain percentage of our population is vaccinated it will be safe, within health guidelines, to start to open up our economy.  That is something we need to impress on the Government, which needs to give some certainty to the industry that when a certain percentage of our population has been vaccinated we can open up within certain guidelines.<\/p> <p>  I looked up the list of people on the tourism recovery task force.  Ms Fitzgerald Kane is on it but there is no representative from the pub or restaurant industry.  I agree with the point that there should be a representative from F&aacute;ilte Ireland on it because it is not just about tourism.  It is about tourism and hospitality so we need to have representatives from the hospitality area on those organisations.<\/p> <p>  The point made that some landlords are looking to charge interest on rent arrears when people are struggling to survive is outrageous.  We need to determine if legislation can be brought in to make that practice illegal.<\/p> <p>  I totally disagree with the two-tier system in terms of opening up hospitality, on which I have spoken numerous times.  I am not be in favour of that happening next year.  There should not be any difference in terms of dry pubs, wet pubs, restaurants or hotels serving food and so on.  It created a divide within the industry which was not good.<\/p> <p>  We have not really tackled the issue of cheap alcohol.  Looking at it from the outside, our pub industry is closed yet we are allowing the large multiples sell cheap alcohol.  We made it quite easy for the younger generation to get drunk with the prices being charged.  An underground drinking culture has developed.  We have seen in the media the number of shebeens, etc., that have been set up across the country.  I feel strongly that we need to address that issue.  There were many discussions a number of years ago with regard to the minimum unit pricing Bill and it has not been introduced.

Like everyone else, what we have heard this afternoon is compelling and harrowing.  We all know local publicans, restaurateurs and hoteliers that have experienced upheaval in their way of life in the past 12 months.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on a few points and I will try not to repeat what others have said.  A few people talked about utilities standing charges.  I am speaking with regard to gas and electricity.  I have been dealing with a number of businesses at constituency level.  I met with Ms Fitzgerald Kane and her colleagues in the Irish Hotels Federation.  I have been doing some work on this.  In the past week I have been in contact with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and it came as somewhat of a surprise to me that it operated a scheme last year from 1 May to 31 July.  That period was the peak of the first wave of Covid-19  when pubs, and virtually everything else, were closed.  The CRU operated a temporary supply suspension scheme.  Within that scheme 200,000 electricity customers and 27,000 gas customers would have been eligible to apply for this support.  Of the 27,000 gas customers, only one in 12 availed of it, and of the 200,000 eligible electricity customers only one in 20 availed of it.  I was flabbergasted by that.  I contacted the CRU during the week to ascertain the reason this scheme was not still operating because as we have heard many businesses, pubs in particular, are now in their 13th month of closure.  It cited that it was due to lack of take-up.  I would say it was due to a lack of information because the few businesses around me at home were not aware of this scheme or were not fully aware of their eligibility.  It is shocking that, one year on, this scheme has been discontinued.<\/p> <p>  Various people told us earlier that the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the commercial rate suspensions and all of the different supports are valued yet more is needed.  There is no magic wand but it is unforgivable that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities would still not have fully grasped this problem.  I will read some figures into the record.  The utilities bill for one month of a hotel nearby me at home was &euro;9,700 and only &euro;4,500 of that related to usage.<\/p><p>That is a colossal standing charge, which is absolutely crippling.  Bearing in mind that the CRSS provides a maximum of &euro;5,000, it is unsustainable.  Could Mr. McGann explain why members of the Vintners Federation of Ireland have not fully availed of this or are they all not qualifying for it?  Perhaps he would respond to that and I will have other questions for other representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#M00900","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1616,"content":"<p>Can you hear me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1617,"content":"<p>Yes, we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1618,"content":"<p>It is lack of information, and that is under many other headings.

There are many other headings we never hear about.<\/p> <p>  It has been fabulous listening to this today.  I am from a small village in a small community.  There are many of us out here who are suffering.  All of us here today have used one word.  The one thing that is needed immediately for every one of us, because we are all planning to reopen in a few months, is money.  Money is what makes the world go around and it would give us an opportunity to plan our opening.  That is what the Government needs immediately, and I ask the committee to convey this to the Government.  Money is available.  We have all been short of money in this country since we were born.  Now there is money available, but it must be made available over a long period.  I suggest ten years.  Five years is the maximum if one goes to the banks.  It should come through the enterprise boards.  We are going to be almost two years without doing business and it will be five years before Covid will be eradicated and we can get back to our 2019 turnover.  Money is what is needed to get all of us off the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1619,"content":"<p>There are others offering to speak, but I have other questions and we have limited time.  What Mr. McGann just said covers it all.  There is a lack of information.  He said it was criminal not to know.  Absolutely, and the audacity of the CRU in the month of March 2021, one year into Covid-19 and closure, to say that there is a lack of interest and lack of take-up is morally wrong a million times over.  When one thinks that cumulatively 227,000 business customers, not all of them, could potentially have availed of this in terms of alleviating cost burdens, that is wrong.  It is criminal.  This committee must immediately ask for the reactivation of that scheme and for a nationwide campaign to ensure hard-pressed businesses avail of a maximum discount in utilities.<\/p> <p>  I will bundle the last few questions I wish to put.  Can Ms Fitzgerald Kane tell us, briefly, if there is any pathway for weddings to resume?  Not every hotel is blessed to be on the Wild Atlantic Way or in the centre of Dublin city.  Many small town hotels rely on weddings every Saturday afternoon when 200 people arrive for receptions.  Accommodation is booked and there are meals.  The supply chain from the local butcher and local farmer is huge.  Everything depends on it.  We are a shade below peak Covid.  It is hard to conceive how this may happen over the coming weeks, but I am hoping the people in the industry might outline how the Irish Hotels Federation see a pathway to that.<\/p> <p>  I have a final question for Mr. McGann.  I believe the pub model that will be most impacted post Covid is the rural leased pub.  I will explain what I mean.  If there is a family pub that has been passed down through the generations, it does not have a mortgage.  It has overheads but the owner will eventually be able to turn a key, open up and somehow cobble together and get going again as a business.  If one is fortunate enough to be in a town or a city centre, there will be footfall owing to the location of the pub.  However, there are many pubs, and I can think of many in County Clare, in which somebody, three or four years ago, decided to take a different pathway in life.  These people leased the pub, be it at the top of the village or at the crossroads a mile from town.  They leased the pub and do not own it.  They are struggling to pay rent at this time.  I believe that is the pub that will go under.  Ultimately, that is the rural licence that will be sold, never to be seen back again.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Ms Fitzgerald Kane and Mr. McGann would respond to those two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1620,"content":"<p>I have to move on in order that Senator Ollie Crowe and I can contribute.

I thank the representatives from the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation their excellent presentations.  As Senator Cassells stated, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, was before the Seanad yesterday and, as a fourth generation publican, I proposed a training programme for the entire hospitality sector.  As was alluded to in earlier contributions, there will be big staff shortages when we reopen.  The Minister assured me that would happen.  To state the obvious, we must open all pubs on the same date, as well as the entire hospitality sector.  Naturally, as we move forward, we need an increase in the financial supports.  Personally, I am working with the Government in respect of the implementation of minimum unit pricing under the alcohol Bill, which is for the betterment of all our people.<\/p> <p>  Moving to insurance, I commend Noel Anderson and three other vintners across the country on taking on the might of the insurance industry and getting a successful outcome in recent weeks.  That is welcome for all business people.  We have seen the frustration of the industry and the hospitality sector at the way insurance companies have carried on over the last number of years.  With regard to the banks, to say they have been abysmal is putting it mildly.  I have contacted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Department of Finance about this issue.  The insurance reform group is working on it.  It is critical that the insurance issue is addressed, as has been outlined with regard to the costs of the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>  All of those involved in the hospitality sector have called for a roadmap to bring certainty to the current situation.  As Mr. Cribben stated, we are not looking for a date.  What we are seeking is that by the end of June 80% will be vaccinated and by the end of July in excess of 80% will have both vaccinations.  That will give us the certainty we require.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I assure the hospitality sector that it has my full support and the support of the Government to reopen and get up and running successfully at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00900","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1624,"content":"<p>We are tight for time, but I would appreciate it if the members would indulge me and let me say a few words.  I will then invite our guests to wrap up, if that is okay.<\/p> <p>  Like my colleagues, I am very passionate about this industry.  I am from a county and constituency in which pubs and restaurants are the lifeblood and heart and soul of what remains of the main streets in our towns and villages.  That is particularly so in rural parts of the constituency.  I commend the businesses that are able to operate at present in some form.  They are the businesses that can provide food.  I have seen it in Bailieborough where Bailie Hotel has rallied to find a new way of doing things by being able to provide a takeaway service for food.  Everybody is sick of cooking at this stage.  However, I feel sorry for the businesses beside them that are closed because they do not provide food or because the business is a non-food pub.  That has been massively divisive and has done a great disservice to towns and villages throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. McGann.<\/p><p>I have had the lovely experience of being in his lovely village pub in Monivea, County Galway.  Like a lot of villages across the country they do far more than just provide a service.  They provide a social amenity where people can meet up, an amenity that has been absolutely wiped out.  Many businesses are run on pride, having been passed on from generation to generation, without ever having been sustainable even before the pandemic happened.  Those people and families had felt a real commitment to their communities to stay open and to provide that social amenity for people to meet up.  The villages' banks are gone, the post offices are gone or the local shop is gone.<\/p><p> On the businesses that have been run as a civic duty to communities and which may not have been sustainable in the first place, have we an idea about how the long period of being closed may have provided an opportunity for people to get out of those businesses?  Have we an idea as to the number of pubs that will not reopen?<\/p><p> I thank our guests for being here.  The committee heard some staggering figures, some compelling statistics and some harrowing stories.  I give the witnesses our assurances that as a committee, we will certainly work on all of the issues raised.  I am very interested in speaking further with Mr. Cummins about the training apprenticeships.  This is something that we must raise with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to make it more attractive to business people.  It certainly would not make any sense that they would pay college fees, which is exactly what is happening and it is cost-prohibitive.<\/p><p> Perhaps Mr. McGann will respond to my questions and then we will bring in any of the other guests who want to contribute and to wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N01000","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1626,"content":"<p>The Chairman's question is hard to answer but I will be honest.  I would say that 30% of rural pubs in Ireland are not sustainable.  They are giving a service to their community.  They do not have their doors opened.  The committee may be aware that many pubs did not open their doors until 2 p.m., 5 p.m., or like myself 7 p.m.  The pubs are giving a service to the community.  As was said earlier, a lot of the other services are closed.  This is their pride and passion.  To close that door would be like going into the grave.  This may take a few months or six months but I believe it will take a year before we realise how many will close.  This is the reason a lot of them are not closing.  It is their passion and it is about keeping that door open.  They would feel so bad about it.  It is because of the three or four generations before them.  There is nothing left in rural Ireland for it to be a sustainable business.  As we know, many places opened takeaways, which I did also, to keep the business going and to give a service to the community.  The other services are not in small communities and they have not been supported by any Government in the past ten years.  The way small rural pubs are at the moment is a very sad state of affairs and especially going forward with regard to rearing a family or anything like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1627,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#O00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1628,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for listening to our concerns here today.

It is very important that a hospitality and tourism skills directorate be set up to co-ordinate all skills for our industry.  This can be either a unit within SOLAS or it could be a reconstituted CERT, such as we had in the past, or some equivalent.  We need one organisation to be in charge of tourism and hospitality training.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of insurance, we must drag every insurance company into the courts to get them to pay what they have to pay out on business interruption claims.  This is totally unfair.  The Central Bank is not doing what it should be doing on this matter.
