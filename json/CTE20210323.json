Some Deputies are appearing remotely from their offices within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  I ask those who are attending remotely to confirm they are within the precincts to fulfil that constitutional requirement.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings on 4 and 9 March have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.<\/p> <p>  The next item of business on today&rsquo;s agenda is correspondence.  We have a substantial amount to deal with.  The Committee of Public Accounts has traditionally considered its correspondence in public session but due to Covid-19 restrictions, revised meeting arrangements have limited the committee&rsquo;s opportunities to meet in public.  We have mainly used that time to fulfil our core role, which is to examine the accounts of public bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  <\/p> <p>  However, we have set aside time today to consider a number of items of correspondence.  Decisions of the committee on items of correspondence that are not addressed at today&rsquo;s meetings are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings which are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p> <p>  No. 381B is from Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, chief executive of Children's Health Ireland, dated 17 February 2021 providing information requested by the committee on non-compliant procurement.  At our meeting on 25 February, we decided to note and publish this item.  It was also agreed to hold it over for consideration in public.  This item is flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is quite difficult to get the context of this response.  A few matters jumped out to me.  One was the payment of &euro;121,000 to the Combined Media company relating to the development, launching and management of the Children's Health Ireland jobs website.  A further &euro;83,000 was paid to Q4 Public Relations.<\/p><p>None of us expects the changes for children's health to come without a cost.  We are trying to keep a close eye on what we are spending and what we are getting for it.  We heard recently from the oversight body for the procurement of the children's hospital that there is substantial slippage in the timeline.  There may well be costs associated with things having to be upgraded while we are waiting for that to be completed.  Some of these are network supports and specialised services that are being brought in.<\/p><p>Why does it need to spend &euro;121,000 on the Children's Health Ireland jobs website which seems like a large amount of money with further money spent on public relations and communications?  Those kinds of things jump out at me.  It is understood that good IT systems are required, but the expectation is that those IT systems in the main will focus on clinical or operational issues.

While in the overall budgets these might seem like small amounts of money, why would a State agency that is charged with building a children's hospital and providing for children's health need to commission a stand-alone PR company to carry out its work?<\/p> <p>  The response from Children's Health Ireland outlines part of the tender process that was employed, but it does not outline the rationale as to why this was required in the first place.  Similarly, there was a very large outlay of funding of in excess of &euro;121,000 on the Combined Media company.

While I know that in the greater scheme of things it is a relatively small amount of money, there is a principle involved here.  It is now the norm that however small a State agency or an arm of the State may be, as a matter of practice one of the PR companies is retained to advise.<\/p> <p>  Of the amounts of money that were spent, as outlined by Deputy Catherine Murphy, what proportion was used in preparation of personnel to appear before Oireachtas committees?<\/p><p>I think that is in part what this money was used for.

I very much disagree with that.  We have seen the importance of communications over recent months.  My difficulty is with the retention of an external company for that service.

There is a difference.  Perhaps, the Comptroller and Auditor General can help us.  It looks like the communications contract was initiated prior to the coming into existence of Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  The use of the word \"completed\" confused me.  Does it mean the contract ended in 2020 and there has been no contract for 2021?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the jobs website, the word \"management\" would imply that there is one or a number of people working on the site on a constant basis.

There is a circular argument there.

As they are related, I will address each of them before opening the floor to members.<\/p> <p> The first of the three is correspondence item No. 396 B, from Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, and dated 24 February.  Mr. Kavanagh wishes to clarify information provided during our meeting with HRI on 23 February 2021.  He believes his exchange with me regarding the provision of funding for CCTV at racecourses around the country could have given the incorrect impression that &euro;9.1 million was allocated in the 2018 integrity services budget for CCTV when, in fact, &euro;9.1 million represented the total budget.  The allocation for CCTV systems was &euro;60,000.  Mr. Kavanagh goes on to say that midway through the year, the IHRB requested that the &euro;60,000 be reallocated to the development of an online trainers licensing system, with the issue of CCTV funding to be revisited in future budgets.  At our meeting on 4 March we decided to clarify this publicly.  As well as holding it over for consideration in public, we also decided to request the IHRB to provide an information note regarding CCTV systems, including why the proposed systems were not installed at more than one racecourse.  I will come to that response shortly.<\/p> <p>  The second item of the three is correspondence item No. 423.  It too is from Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive, Horse Racing Ireland.  It is dated 4 March and provides follow-up information relating to 14 questions arising from our meeting with HRI on 23 February.  At our meeting on 11 March we decided to note and publish this item.<\/p> <p>  The third and final related item is correspondence item No. 439 B.  It is from Mr. Denis Egan, chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, and is dated 11 March.  It is the response I mentioned to our correspondence to IHRB regarding CCTV installations at racecourses.  Mr. Egan states that &euro;60,000 was originally allocated in the IHRB&rsquo;s budget to provide CCTV at four racecourses but that the HRI took over the project in March 2018 and the funds were then transferred to its budget.  However, the project did not commence in 2018 and the money went back to the IHRB.  This money is doing the rounds.  Mr. Egan states that money - a total of &euro;80,000 this time - was again allocated for CCTV systems in the HRI budget of 2019.<\/p><p>However, the project had not started by July 2019, so the money again went back to the IHRB.  The correspondence goes on to give some detail about the online licensing system that was prioritised over CCTV systems, including the IHRB's request that the &euro;80,000 be allocated to online licensing and the board of HRI's agreement to that request.  Despite being requested of the IHRB, though, the current position regarding the installation of CCTV systems is not addressed.  I propose that we note and publish this item and reiterate the committee's request to the IHRB to clarify the current situation regarding the roll-out of CCTV systems at racecourses around the country and to include budget allocations and timelines for installation.<\/p><p> I am baffled.

There are a hell of a lot of unanswered questions.  When HRI appeared before the committee, it outlined the situation as regards funding of CCTV and indicated that, following installation at a single racecourse stables in 2017, funding had been provided to extend the installation to all courses.  We were made aware that, at the start of 2018, a change in the laboratory that was being used by the regulatory board had seen an increase of, I believe, more than 400% in the number of positive tests.  Six months later, though, the regulatory board sought to divert the funds away from the installation of CCTV to an online integrity portal.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, HRI has been forthcoming with information pertaining to itself, but its relationship with the regulatory board is an odd one because it seems to obscure the situation.  I suggest that the committee write directly to the regulatory board requesting a briefing on the proposed installation of CCTV from 2017 onwards and to include in that briefing detailed notes on changes in budget allocations.  I also suggest that we request a note from the regulatory board on the integrity portal or whatever it is - the board referred to it as being an online trainers licensing system - so that we might get a better understanding of it.  HRI indicated that the regulatory board was the expert in this area and had a better understanding of how the money would be spent, but it seems very odd.  The relationship between the two bodies is obscuring information.  We need these questions answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#D00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The context is that just short of &euro;80 million, which comes from the gambling tax, goes to HRI.

All credit goes to Ms Rachael Blackmore for lifting many people's spirits.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the integrity fund.  We need to protect that investment and the large number of people working in this sector.  The sector must be above reproach, and the money for CCTV at stables is meant for that purpose.  Even though the funding was allocated in 2018, CCTV had only been installed at the stables of only one racecourse when we met HRI this year.  There is still confusion about what the expectation was exactly when the money was allocated.  When will every racecourse be fully covered by CCTV?<\/p> <p>  I am uneasy with the crossover between the two boards.  Three people from the regulatory board are on the board of HRI.  I am concerned about the lack of separation and whether that was done by design.  It is important that we have clarity about this aspect.<\/p> <p>  The situation with the allocation is not clear.  As the Chairman stated, the money has gone back and forth before being diverted.  Installing CCTV at 26 racecourses is not an onerous project and I do not know why it has not been done.

We must have clarity on this.

I share Deputy Catherine Murphy's concerns that the racing authority and regulatory board seem to have an intertwined relationship.  I am not sure that that is necessarily healthy.

My only regret is that I did not back her, but that is just the way things go.<\/p> <p>  I will refer specifically to correspondence No. 423B from HRI, which contained responses to questions that we raised.  Sometimes, people infer that when committees like ours question how public money is spent, we are attacking the principle of supporting the horse racing sector.  This sector provides a valuable contribution to our rural economy but could it do more for more people?<\/p><p> Members will recall when we had Horse Racing Ireland before the committee and I questioned its decision, which essentially ensures that the State funding or the taxpayers' money that is invested is redistributed through prize money.  In the year in that we are discussing, which this correspondence deals with, the State's contribution to HRI was &euro;67 million and the prize money awarded that year was &euro;66 million but when I put it to HRI that this was consolidating a small number of top trainers in particular, it disputed that and argued that the money had trickled down, so that was trickle-down economics at its best, and that much more outside of.the official figures went to breeders across the country.  In this response, it shows that of that prize money of &euro;66 million, a sum of &euro;385,000 went to breeders.  Clearly, it is not the case that breeders, particularly smaller breeders, get a substantial part of the funding.  Clearly, there are some sectors within the horse racing family that are less profitable or benefit less than others.  The point-to-point racing sector, which we correctly hear is the breeding ground for future successes, received circa &euro;900,000 per annum but, again, that is from a prize fund of &euro;66 million in 2019.  Consequently, I propose that we write to HRI.  I also propose that we write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ask it whether it is satisfied that the prize money and prize fund distribution are the best way to redistribute State funds to have the maximum beneficial impact on rural economies and on the future growth of the sector.  We should ask the Department whether, in its view the prize money and prize fund distribution are the best way to ensure that as many people as possible receive a benefit and that as many communities as possible receive an economic benefit from the substantial State contribution that is invested in the sector.  That is my formal proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#D00700","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I agree and concur with all my colleagues and request that the committee writes to HRI.

I did ask Mr. Kavanagh if we could have a copy of his submission to the Department on point-to-point racing because, as one can see, a sum of &euro;900,000 was paid out for point-to-point prize winning.  I questioned where would the money go or be spent if point-to-point races were not run?<\/p> <p>  Equally, we now see a situation arising where our point-to-point entrants are going elsewhere.  They should be racing in this State but we are not open because we have no further plan to get us out of level 5.

There is very little transparency about salaries in the accounts and HRI used something it states it submitted to the Department outlining that it has some form of an amnesty.

I thank the Secretary General for his reply; it is most comprehensive.  There is some very useful information in it.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on the issue of the national broadband plan, we know that an attempt is being made to reduce costs by using metropolitan area networks, MANs, and existing poles from Eircom.  Analysys Mason is one of the entities that provided technical guidance.  I recall that it produced a report, and when representatives appeared before the committee, that report was a year old.  When it was published, the upshot of the report was that we were told that the use of these facilities would halve the cost of broadband.<\/p> <p>  We know that the national broadband plan is about the number of houses that are passed.  However, the number of premises that are connected will be determined, in some cases, by the cost of broadband.  In keeping an eye on this project, we must ask the Department for an update on analysis that has been done.  At the point that this Analysys Mason report was provided, Ireland had the most expensive broadband in Europe.  It is absolutely right that existing facilities are leveraged to reduce the cost, but we need to know if the Department is keeping an eye on the end user cost because that will determine the entities that run it.  We are told that any benefit will come back to the State.  It is important, therefore, that we keep an eye on that.<\/p> <p>  On the Eversheds Sutherland report on RT&Eacute;, we wrote to RT&Eacute; seeking a response.  I have not seen a clarification in respect of the 78 people who had accepted permanent contracts of employment, as opposed to permanent contracts for services.  There is no doubt that an organisation such as RT&Eacute; will need to have people on contracts for services, given the nature of the business.  However, there was a cohort of people that should have been on staff or on contracts of employment.<\/p> <p>  This issue really matters because it is an example of a practice that will be taking place elsewhere.  RT&Eacute; has formally offered those people contracts but we must ensure we receive a proper response on whether the contracts will apply retrospectively.  It can make a sizeable difference to people, for example, in respect of pension entitlements later on, taxation forgone by Revenue, and also in respect of the number of years of employment completed, should a person be made redundant.  Therefore, it is most important that we stick with it, watch out for a response and do not let the matter slip.<\/p> <p>  On the Eircode system, we have heard about public awareness.  We have been told that public awareness is being monitored and it is clear that there are public awareness targets.  However, do we know if there is any evidence of usage of this pretty expensive system?  I would have thought that outcomes would have been sought in relation to that.  The system is a valuable one, for example, for the National Ambulance Service, but are people generally using it outside of that?  The design of the system was previously heavily criticised in respect of how it might be used.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of CCTV and illegal dumping, the Data Protection Commission is engaging with the City and County Management Association.  Very often, people have expectations that CCTV will sort everything out.  Local authorities have a scheme in place to tackle the problem.  I do not know whether it is active in each local authority area at this point.  However, the Data Protection Commission has a problem with the scheme, which means that it cannot be used.  There seems to be something odd about us providing grants for a scheme on the one side and on the other side an entity of the State having concerns, or more than that, about it being used.  What are the circumstances that allow CCTV to be used legally?  Are we spending money on grants that are not going to provide a return on that investment and the investment of community time because it is down to individuals?  There is matching funding for a dumping initiative, if I remember rightly.  While the initiative might be valuable, if it cannot be used, we must question the value of it.  We must also ask what needs to be put in place for the Data Protection Commission in respect of who can access the information to make the scheme an active one.  Those are the main issues I wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#F00700","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The committee previously expressed disappointment that the Eversheds Sutherland report was not published and that we only received it in summary format.<\/p><p>I understand that RT&Eacute; will appear before the committee in the next couple of weeks.

Everyone else is happy enough with it.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of points regarding the report from the Secretary General, Mr. Mark Griffin.  I must say it is very comprehensive.  A study is being carried out regarding the potential use of the Lough Ree and Shannonbridge power plants.  The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, requested a study be undertaken, according to the correspondence from the Secretary General.  It sets out that a feasibility study into the options for the future use of the existing infrastructure in west Offaly and Lough Ree has been undertaken over recent months.  Members will remember and note those two power plants ceased operations earlier this year.  The question, and the context in which I raised this with Mr. Griffin on the day he appeared before the committee, is that they are located strategically on the national grid in an area where large land banks are to be used for solar panels and sensitively located wind turbines.  I stress the words \"sensitively located\".  They are on fairly extensive sites which could be used for biomass or biogas.  We note the group that has undertaken the work is expected to conclude shortly.  I ask the clerk to the committee to request that we be kept abreast by the Department and the Secretary General, Mr. Griffin, of any progress.  There is huge concern in the midlands that those two sites do not become land with plant rusting away on them.  They are in a very strategic location on the grid to be brought into future use.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is regarding the CCTV cameras, which has been alluded to already.  From speaking to local authorities and from having raised the issue with Mr. Griffin when the Department appeared before the committee, my understanding is that the legislation must be changed to facilitate the use of CCTV to try to counter illegal dumping, which is a problem in my constituency of Laois&ndash;Offaly.  I am sure it is a problem in every other constituency throughout the country, and it is not getting better.  Local authorities were using cameras, and it was possible to move them from one location to another.  The Data Protection Commission intervened and said they must stop because there is a question mark over legislation and the legalities of all this, and legislation must be framed for it.  I ask that we send a note to the Secretary General of the Department asking that the legislation be brought forward to the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.  It is a very real problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#G00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>In his correspondence, the Secretary General, Mr. Griffin, mentions that a value for money review of the Eircode system will  be conducted at some point this year.

I am not happy with the response from UL at all.  Regarding the representatives from the university appearing before the committee, I want to ensure that the invitation in that regard is all-encompassing.  I state that because we want to discuss a series of issues not dealt with adequately as a result of the work of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It was even suggested that the Garda fraud squad be requested to look at this.  I made such a formal request previously to the then president or chancellor of the university, or whatever position it was at the time.  The answer I got was that he would take that under advisement.  I certainly felt that a cursory look at the situation by the Garda was necessary, at a minimum, such was the material available to us.  We will want to go over that ground and I am conscious that we have these new Standing Orders now, which are for our benefit.  I want to ensure, therefore, that whatever we have to say is covered, and that the request, for example, would be something like, \"Dear UL, we want to discuss everything, yours sincerely\".  The subject matter of the invitation is important in ensuring we can cover everything.<\/p> <p>  On protective disclosures generally, the system is totally stacked.  I happily advise anyone thinking of issuing a protected disclosure to not do so in the current environment, because he or she will be thrown under the bus, penalised and subject to different treatment.  Outwardly, the situation will be dressed up as being one which is open, where people are encouraged to come forward and there is a desire to improve, and all that kind of stuff.  There is one proviso, however, and that is it does not make the system or the organisation look bad.  That is the problem with the current situation.  I refer to the idea of farming such matters out to a senior counsel, who is picked, and the terms of reference then be determined by people in-house in an organisation or in a Department or whatever.  I refer to all the vested interests who do not want a negative outlook on a Department or agency or a portion of a Department or agency.  <\/p> <p>  I do not know if that is work for this committee, the Joint Committee on Justice or other committees, but we must start from scratch regarding protected disclosures, protecting whistle-blowers and ensuring that what we have seen time and time again, such as in the case of Maurice McCabe, for example, who was very high profile, does not happen.  All of us, as Deputies and members of this committee, have seen many examples of people who have not ended up as part of a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme, but for all the world have suffered comparable discrimination and penalisation through, in effect, trying to improve their workplaces and make them fairer and better for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#H00800","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I would like to make a brief point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#H00900","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Go ahead, briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#H01000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I am curious as to whether this is something ever sought by the Comptroller and Auditor General, not within the context of accounts, obviously, but people often bring forward information.

Not every protected disclosure will be found to be correct, but people are really putting their heads above the parapet.  We must then interrogate whether those people who have brought protected disclosures forward are still in the jobs they were in before bringing forward information, which may have been of value in changing a workplace culture.

It was very surprising.  Its approach to this committee leaves a lot to be desired.  The tone of the interaction at the committee hearing and in Caranua's written correspondence is unlike anything we have received in my time on this committee.  It is important for me to put that on the record.  I do not believe that I or any other member of this committee intended to engage with Caranua in a confrontational way.  We were all simply putting what I thought were standard questions - in some instances, on behalf of survivors of institutional abuse.  The responses from Caranua were over the top.<\/p><p>I am particularly uncomfortable with the assertion that has now been made in a number of items of correspondence and was repeated on several occasions at the hearing.  I will quote directly from the most recent correspondence from the CEO, Rachel Downes, in which she states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI suggested that members of the Committee could discuss matters that were presenting as a concern after the hearing. I have received no request from any member to discuss matters subsequent to my attendance before the Committee. <\/blockquote> <p>Repeatedly during the hearing and in other correspondence, this same assertion has been made that members could have a private chat with the CEO to discuss matters.  This shows a lack of appreciation for the role of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Our role is not to satisfy our own desire for information.  Our role is to put questions on behalf of the Irish taxpayer and Irish citizens.  I would have thought that previous experience would have shown that private conversations in car parks are not the way in which witnesses or bodies should be interacting with this committee.  I wanted to put all of that on the record.  <\/p><p>It is also important that we correspond with the Department of Education to get a detailed framework as to how the issues pertaining to Caranua will move and be addressed because the explanation outlined to us that a new board will be put in place without staff and without a budget to all intents and purposes yet some executive responsibility will lie within the Department is a recipe for disaster.  It is, therefore, very important that we get clarification on that as speedily as possible.  My proposal is that we write to the Secretary General of the Department seeking that clarification, the framework for how the work of Caranua will proceed, a timeframe for the legislation to formally wind down Caranua and a subsequent framework for how outstanding issues relating to institutional abuse and claims may be dealt with in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#K00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Just to clarify, I think the Deputy included in his proposal - if not, it needs to be included - that we look for progress on the two cases that were addressed with Caranua from the Department.

No. 436 is a letter to me as Chairperson of the committee, dated 10 March, and No. 443 includes a request for updates relating to the letter.  Part of the discussion on 9 March concerned Bibby Financial Services Ireland because it is in receipt of funding detailed in the SBCI financial statements.  No. 436, the letter from Bibby Financial Services, makes a number of points arising from that discussion and as the company was not represented at the meeting and, therefore, did not have the right of reply, I believe it is appropriate that the committee should note the following points that were made in the letter: Bibby states that it has at all times operated in accordance with the terms and covenants of its agreement with SBCI and in compliance with all other regulations in Ireland.  Bibby states that none of the funding it received as part of its agreement with SBCI has been used by the Bibby Line Group or Bibby Financial Services' UK business.  Bibby strongly refutes any suggestion that it has operated in an unlawful way at any time or has acted outside the terms of its agreement with SBCI.  Bibby states that it has undergone rigorous due diligence and audit processes on a number of occasions with SBCI and has met all requirements on all occasions.  Bibby states that it is proud of its role in supporting the Irish economy and that it has made more than &euro;600 million available to Irish SMEs since 2018.  I propose that we note and publish No. 436 and advise Bibby accordingly.  Is that agreed?  In the correspondence advising Bibby of the decision, I will inform Bibby about the option of making a submission under Standing Order 711 in the event that it is unhappy with the way in which the matter has been dealt with.  In relation to SBCI, the secretariat is compiling the questions that members have submitted for it to respond to.  I understand there are currently more than 30 questions and we will consider these at our meeting tomorrow.  We are seeking a lot of information from SBCI regarding this.  As has been outlined, there are more than 30 questions to be put.  I remind members that when we talk about an entity or body that is not present, we should be careful regarding our legal requirements.  I will open it up to the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#K00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the Chairman read out the letter from the relevant company.  It is more than entitled to do so.  Our issue as a committee is with the SBCI and the lending of money that was envisaged for a particular purpose.  Of course, it will understand, as, I am sure, does the company that wrote to us does, that we have a responsibility to examine that.  Many questions have been submitted and I know they will be laundered through the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser tomorrow.  I have not submitted my questions yet because I do not intend to have them laundered by anybody.  I have my own legal advisers, who can advise on that.  My analysis of this particular transaction is a matter of major concern to me.  The auditors of the company that wrote to the Chairman have resigned.  It is a matter of concern whether SBCI would have been aware of that at the time we were questioning about this matter.  If it was not aware of it, what was the reason?  Other issues do not make me comfortable that the money that was lent was lent for the purposes for which it was intended.  That may be a failing, as I was at pains to point out at our previous meeting, which I know was in private.  In fairness to the company in question, I am happy to say publicly that the failing may have been with the original legislation and oversight of it by the Oireachtas.  It may have been failings in the legislation itself but it is our responsibility to get to the bottom of it because of the amount involved.  Certainly the spirit of the legislation, which I was in the House for when it was put through, is not captured in this.  There is no suggestion that the company did anything wrong but it may well be the case that SBCI or indeed Members of these Houses did.  We have a responsibility to find out whether this is the case.  I formally propose that notwithstanding any considerations tomorrow at our private meeting, we invite SBCI back before us to examine this transaction in detail.<\/p><p>Moreover, the invitation should specifically point out that we want to talk in detail about this transaction and no other.  An all-encompassing invitation should be issued so that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland representatives are in no doubt whatsoever about the need to have all details with them in respect of underwriting, due diligence and everything else in order that we can go through all of this in detail.  I am afraid information given at the meeting by the SBCI representatives does not tally with the information in this letter or other information provided to me and other members of the committee.<\/p><p> It is a matter without prejudice to anyone.  It may well be our fault - the fault of Deputies and Senators in these Houses.  This requires and demands a public investigation with SBCI without prejudice to the company involved.  That is our responsibility.<\/p><p> In advance of our private meeting tomorrow I want to put a point on the record.  Parliamentary privilege exists for a reason.  Sometimes, where the Legislature crosses with private society and the commercial world, it is necessary to refer to certain entities and companies and, at times, individuals.  That is the very reason parliamentary privilege exists in a democracy.  It is beyond ridiculous and absurd in the extreme to wall ourselves off to the extent that we cannot do our job in holding ourselves and the public purse to account.  That is what I intend to do regardless of any advice tomorrow.  I believe and hope colleagues will approve the proposal today.  I do not want it to go to a private discussion tomorrow.  I wish to formally propose that, as a matter of urgency, we bring SBCI representatives back in to discuss that transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021032300002#K00800","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616491800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Essentially, the purpose of SBCI, or this particular aspect of the entity, was to ensure that the funding was to be used exclusively for the Irish economy and for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Obviously, Bibby Financial Services Ireland is a component of the arrangements.

It appears to be a perplexing situation.  The HSE has outsourced the running of the doctor on call services to a private company.  The HSE is under the impression that this company has an obligation to provide particular services in some parts of Cork.  We are told that on 14 March last year SouthDoc closed 11 facilities across counties Cork and Kerry.  On 18 and 29 September and on 1 October the HSE wrote to SouthDoc requesting the restoration of a service plan for Listowel and Blackpool.  SouthDoc sent a letter stating it is not planning to open either Listowel or Blackpool.<\/p> <p>  This is a potentially very serious matter and it is crucial we get a full appraisal from the HSE as to how it finds itself in this position where services to local communities are being essentially denied by a private company which has received &euro;7.294 million in 2019 and 2020.  How can an organisation be in receipt of that level of taxpayers' money and yet refuse point blank to provide a service?

The current situation is that the provision of services is totally on one side of the city and there is not access by bus or other public transport to the location on the south side of the city.  Even the people on the south side do not have bus access to that location.

I am joined by R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hickey from the Irish economic analysis division of the Central Bank.  I will give a brief summary of the outlook for the economy, drawing on the macroeconomic forecasts set out in our latest quarterly bulletin, but I will also take account of the developments and available indicators since then.  We will be publishing updated forecasts in our forthcoming quarterly bulletin at the beginning of April.<\/p> <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic and the measures to contain the spread of the virus, which has caused an unprecedented contraction in the Irish and world economies over the past year, are likely to remain the dominant determinant of the path of the economy this year and in 2022.  The near-term prospects have deteriorated following a resurgence in Covid-19 cases early in 2021.  However, the prospect of a successful deployment of vaccines from an increasing range of choices does offer the prospect of recovery from the second half of the year, underpinned by continued support from accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.<\/p> <p>  Preliminary national accounts statistics, which show GDP growth of 3.4% last year, indicate remarkable resilience in headline growth given the exceptional scale of the shock to domestic and world demand.  However, the headline GDP figure was boosted by strong export growth that was, in turn, largely accounted for by a surge in pharmaceutical exports and continued strength in the IT sector.  This masked a decline in domestic demand which was among the most severe in the EU.  Output declined in all other sectors, with the largest declines in sectors with a high dependence on face-to-face contact with customers including the arts, hotels, bars and restaurants and high-street retailers.  Private consumption last year was down by 9% compared with the previous year, with modified domestic demand down by 5.4%.<\/p> <p>  The impact of the pandemic is particularly evident in the labour market.  While the headline unemployment rate has not changed significantly, reflecting standard international statistical conventions regarding its measurement, the Covid-adjusted rate, which includes those workers who are availing of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, increased rapidly.  It currently stands at a rate of 24.8%.  When we also include the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, approximately 960,000 people, or 39.3% of the labour force, are currently in receipt of one form or other of income support.  The figures also show that younger and lower paid workers have been most affected.<\/p> <p>  The concentration of the pandemic labour market shock among workers in the bottom half of the income distribution is reflected in a corresponding decline in compensation per worker or earnings.  That this has not been reflected in a decline in disposable incomes &ndash; disposable incomes actually increased last year by about 4% &ndash; is testament to the effectiveness of Government income support measures.  Similarly, at firm level, Government support measures have provided significant mitigation to the financial distress to SMEs most affected by pandemic-related business disruption.  These supports, while proportionate and appropriate to the size of the shock to households and firms, have been unprecedented in scale, amounting to more than 11% of modified gross national income, GNI*.  The general government balance has moved from a small surplus of 0.9% to a deficit of just under 9% of GNI* in 2020 and is likely to remain close to that level again this year.  This has resulted also in an increase in public sector debt and the debt-to-national income ratio.<\/p> <p>  The resurgence in infections since December and the reimposition of strict containment measures weakens the near-term outlook and makes it more uncertain.  The containment measures have dampened economic activity significantly in the first quarter of this year and, beyond that, some public health measures are likely to continue to be required, until the successful deployment of effective vaccines reaches a significant proportion of the population.  Assuming successful deployment of vaccines by the second half of the year, domestic economic activity should begin to rebound.  On this basis, modified domestic demand is forecast to grow by 2.9% in 2021, while GDP is projected to grow by 3.8%, although the recovery in the labour market is likely to lag somewhat until the broader economic recovery becomes more established.  The outlook is considerably uncertain, however, and contingent on key assumptions on Covid-19 developments.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, a further pick-up is projected in 2022, with modified domestic demand forecast to grow by 3.6% and GDP projected to grow by 4.6%.  While uncertainty and a subdued labour market are likely to keep precautionary savings elevated in 2021, these restraints should ease next year.  The unwinding of the large stock of savings accumulated during the pandemic should support a strong recovery in consumption in 2022.  Similarly, the reduction in uncertainty should allow investment to begin to recover next year.<\/p> <p>  The new EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, has averted the threat of a no-deal Brexit and means that the significant disruption to economic activity that would have accompanied such an outcome has been avoided.  The new agreement allows for the continuation of a basic economic relationship between the EU and UK.  Nevertheless, the EU-UK TCA makes trade in both goods and services more cumbersome and costly relative to EU membership.  In the short run, this is likely to be associated with continued supply-chain disruption.  In the long run, the negative impact of the UK's EU exit on trade flows, migration and productivity will reduce output in the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude my remarks with some views on the policy response to the pandemic and, in particular, how the available policy instruments can best support a sustainable recovery.  The impact of the pandemic has been mitigated by a range of fiscal, monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy actions to support vulnerable households and businesses.  In the near term, policy must remain focused on supporting household incomes and firm liquidity to provide the most solid basis for recovery.  However, the size and nature of that support should be ready to adapt to changing circumstances.<\/p><p>Policy support should continue to counter the threat to viable economic activities and employment from the pandemic and, in time, facilitate structural transformations that support economically sustainable activities.  This would help to enhance resilience, support the productive capacity of the economy and mitigate scarring effects such as long-term unemployment.<\/p><p> On the fiscal side, the increase in deficit and debt ratios that has occurred has been both warranted and necessary.  Policy support will need to be maintained over the short term to stabilise the economy.  When health risks diminish, however, any continued support via current expenditure should be targeted and temporary, while any permanent increases in current expenditure will need to be funded in a sustainable manner.  Ultimately, more favourable growth dynamics in coming years should support a decline in the public debt ratio.  Even if action does not need to be taken now, however, it is important to plan to reduce the level of the debt ratio in time to a more sustainable level to ensure that the economy can face future shocks with sufficient headroom such that all available policy instruments can be deployed.<\/p><p> I look forward to the discussion with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas, a Chathaoirligh, agus as an gcur i l&aacute;thair sin.<\/p> <p>  How many bonds have been issued by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, since the start of the pandemic and what proportion is held by the ECB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>There have been two issuances this year, amounting to &euro;7 billion.

I had heard that the figure was one third, so the ECB has, essentially, monetised that debt.<\/p> <p>  Following on from that, many have pointed out that a clean distinction between monetary and fiscal policy was one of the first casualties of the global financial crisis of 2008.  In the current crisis, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish where one policy ends and the other begins, which is only natural given where we are today.  This interplay of monetary and fiscal policy has brought a co-ordinated crisis response, one of mutual benefit.  The ECB backstop - the bond markets of member states - is allowing them to engage in countercyclical spending and I very much welcome that.<\/p> <p>  Closer to home, however, there is a crisis in our highly domestic banking sector, which Mario Draghi described as a \"quasi-monopoly\", and the concentration of the banks' internal risk-weighted models means we have the highest mortgage rates in the EU.  A further crisis is that if Ulster Bank's deposit book is distributed among the other banks, they could move to impose negative rates on retail customers.   Moreover, there is the possibility that the Government, through its significant shareholdings, could urge the banks to offset potential negative rates by accessing funding through, perhaps, the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations, TLTRO, which offers the bank funding at negative rates and is unofficially seen as a way to mitigate negative interest rates for banks.<\/p> <p>  Given that a future of banking in Ireland commission could be in train and considering everything I have mentioned, the case for the Central Bank playing an active role in the commission seems fairly indisputable.

It is clear we have a heavily concentrated banking system compared with those of some other European countries, with somewhat less competition.  Legacy and other issues, too, contribute to making our retail interest rates higher than those of other countries.  As the Deputy will probably be aware, they are the second highest in the EU.  That relates partly to previous losses from the crisis and partly to issues with banks being able to access collateral.  This leads to a requirement for more capital in banks, which can pass through to their ability to pass on lower rates to consumers.<\/p> <p>  The TLTRO, which the Deputy mentioned, are a potential option of which banks can avail if they wish to access that type of funding.  Certain conditions are attached and some of the Irish banks access that type of funding.

We provided an assessment to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in which we examined the shared equity scheme under a number of headings relating to our mandate for financial stability, our mandate for consumer protection and broader dynamics in the market.  As for the third heading, which related to pricing and affordability, our assessment was that the main problem in the market relates to a lack of supply, about which I think there is a general consensus.  We think the main effect of the shared equity scheme may be on demand and that while that may have some effect on supply, the effect may not be too great because there seems to be some sluggishness in how supply responds to demand.<\/p> <p>  We cannot yet provide an assessment regarding how great any impact on prices might be because we do not yet have enough information regarding the design of these measures.

Until we have more details, we will not be able to provide any quantification on supply.<\/p> <p>  Whether house prices should be taken into consideration in the assessment of price stability is a very topical, important and relevant issue.  The Central Bank of Ireland, of course, is part of the euro system and we contribute to its monetary policy.  The ECB is currently undertaking a fundamental review of its monetary policy strategy.  It will be a very comprehensive review of many different areas.  One key element will examine whether owner-occupied housing should be included in the measurement of the price basket when ECB takes decisions regarding price stability.  It is too early to say what the outcome will be in that respect - the findings are expected to be announced during the second half of this year - but the issue is under active consideration as part of that stability review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I have one more question in the brief time that remains in my slot.  It relates to climate change.  In previous years, the ECB and the central banks it co-ordinates have often had too great a focus on price stability, unlike the US Federal Reserve, which also has a focus on creating full employment.  The president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, recently stated that climate change affects all the bank's policy areas and that a new climate change unit has been established.  This decision, an ECB press release stated, \"reflects the growing importance of climate change for the economy\".  It seems to tie in with the EU's efforts to initiate a green new deal with a just transition, which is necessary if Europe is to reach its targets.<\/p><p>It is clear that in order to do this, massive investment is required in green technology.  Economists working in the climate area argue that spending of 2.5% of GDP on green investment and just transition is required but our Minister for Finance is arguing that we must start to reduce our spending and reduce our rate of borrowing.  At the same time, the T&aacute;naiste has been warning that inflation is about to take off, despite the fact that the EU has spent the past decade fighting deflation.  Does the Central Bank accept that EU states must have access to the kind of funding required for large-scale green investment projects and that it is necessary to increase investment in these technologies if the EU is to come anywhere close to reaching its targets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#B00900","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions, the response to which I will break down into a couple of different elements.  Deputy Farrell mentioned that a new climate change unit has been set up at the ECB.  I can confirm that we have done the same within the Central Bank in Dublin.  That reflects the importance of climate change, including for central banks; this is not just something that we are looking out at in the rest of the economy.  Climate change has a significant impact on the mandate of central banks, including through potential risks or impacts on price stability through its effects on the real economy, as well as its potential effects on financial stability, perhaps through the exposure of banks or insurance companies.  We are directly interested and are taking our responsibilities in that regard very seriously.  There is also the extent to which the central banking community in the euro system should be commenting on more general economic issues around central banking or taking that into consideration in our monetary policy decisions.  I am sorry to be giving a similar answer to the previous one but this is under active consideration in the current ECB strategy review.  What I can say is that the mandate of the ECB is very clear, namely that the primary concern is price stability.  The secondary objective, without prejudice to price stability, is to take action to support the general economic policies of the EU which would include climate change.  There is an indirect opportunity there, as long as it does not conflict with the primary objective of price stability which remains paramount.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the politics, I will not comment on the political dimension apart from agreeing with the fundamental importance of capital expenditure to mitigate risks relating to climate change.  This is very clearly present in both our domestic national development plan, much of which relates to climate activities and also in the plans for the EU recovery and resilience facility, over one third of which must involve climate change measures.

It is clear that the accommodative monetary policy reflected in low, zero and, in some instances, negative interest rates, as well as very significant asset purchases, has had a significant downward impact on Government borrowing costs, which are at around zero at the moment.  That largely reflects ECB monetary policy actions to which we can contribute.  In addition to the direct effect on sovereign borrowing costs, there is the effect on lending costs of financial institutions, which depend more than anything on those sovereign yields.  The third effect is that the ECB's monetary policy is having a positive impact on the economic performance of the euro area as a whole and we benefit, in a secondary way, through spillovers from that positive growth.  That is currently having a very significant effect and we published some analysis of that yesterday.  The analysis shows that for both Ireland and the euro area, the results are roughly similar.  Output this year is around 1.5% higher than it would be in the absence of this monetary policy.<\/p> <p>  I have just outlined the actions that have already been taken.  What I would say about the recovery period is that the ECB is committed to ensuring that this accommodative monetary policy remains in place.  The asset purchases will continue until at least March 2022 and longer, if necessary.  Similarly, the guidance is that the interest rate environment will remain low until the recovery is established.  It is very clear, through the monetary policy to which we contribute, that we are having and will continue to have a significant effect.<\/p> <p>  Our other responsibility is in the area of providing economic analysis and comment.  Our public comments with regard to the public finances are very supportive of the idea that additional policy measures are required and that there is a role for fiscal policy in supporting the recovery, enhancing the productive capacity and reducing the scarring effects.  We are very supportive of Government actions in that regard.

Hopefully, this recovery will come about in a somewhat different fashion to the recovery following the last economic crash.  It has been indicated to various committees in recent weeks that the banking sector will develop the means to assess the viability of small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  I am not sure this is necessarily the best approach because it puts the assessment in the hands of the banks instead of the customer.  It is necessary to take into account the views of those who have set up and maintained businesses and kept people in employment in both good times and bad in recent years.  To what extent will the Central Bank be in a position to encourage the lenders to take account of the expertise in the SME sector, as opposed to what happened in the aftermath of the economic crash?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#C01000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>We were in a very different situation with the recovery the last time.  We have a much stronger banking system now, much healthier public finances, lower indebtedness and the structure of the economy is much better placed to recover.<\/p><p>We are also in a situation where the Government can put money into the economy during a downturn as opposed to the need to take it out of the economy during the downturn, which was the situation last year because our borrowing costs had risen to levels which, frankly, nobody was willing to lend us money at, and which compares with a situation now where we are borrowing for ten years at effectively 0%.<\/p><p> The viability of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, will be a critical issue on the path to recovery of this economy.  It is clear that there are a lot of SMEs that are experiencing considerable losses at the same time that they would be structurally fundamentally sound when the economy begins.  That, of course, is the rationale for the Government supports to the SME sector which are extremely important.  Much of the distress will not become evident until after those supports are removed and that is when public policy reaches a critical juncture.  Certainly, public policy will have to make decisions with regard to the balance between ongoing support for the sector versus trying to assess viability and trying to support new emerging sectors.<\/p><p> With regard to the Central Bank's role in this, I suppose we engage at a supervisory level with the banks.  It is important for them to make quality risk assessments so as not to be putting their own funds in jeopardy.  At the same time, we also discuss with banks the bigger picture.  The economy as a whole does not benefit if there is to be undue closing of small and medium-sized enterprises.  It is in nobody's interest for the economy as a whole to be affected negatively as a result.  Therefore, it is important that banks also take into consideration the larger picture in making decisions.  I am not involved in the supervisory area.  Personally, I cannot say anything more about that engagement, except to agree with what Deputy Durkan says.  As a general comment, there are many small and medium-sized enterprises that are a significant part of society and community and they need to be considered as such rather than in the narrow financial contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Have I ten minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Nine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming.<\/p> <p>  This is a genuine question.

For the economy generally, clearly we are hoping for the scenario, that I think people now expect, whereby the vaccines get successfully rolled out during the second half of the year and are effective in combatting the virus.  Anything where that does not materialise is the greatest short-term risk for the economy.<\/p> <p>  Over the longer term, and this is getting also into the policy dimension, there are a number of challenges for Government policy.  First of all, one will see additional financial pressures for the Exchequer from ageing, particularly as and from 2040, and also in relation to climate change.  There is a draft Bill today which will include intermediate or secondary targets for before 2050.  There are many medium-term pressures in the public finances that need to be considered now.  They would be difficult to deal with if they are not addressed now.<\/p> <p>  In addition, Ireland is a small, open economy.  We are always more vulnerable to shocks to the external environment than other countries and that remains the case.  I would note maybe two of those in particular.  First, we have a high degree of reliance on corporation taxes paid by foreign multinationals.  It is welcome that we receive these corporation taxes but there are risks to those because there is quite a high degree of concentration in a small number of sectors and small number of firms.  There is also an international process under the OECD in terms of changes to international taxation arrangements and it is acknowledged that Ireland could lose some of its current tax revenues as a result of that process.  Risks relating to the external environment, multinationals and SMEs are important.<\/p> <p>  I suppose a third concern is that while the public finances remain in a generally favourable position and they can absorb the additional expenditures that will be required this year and perhaps after to alleviate the current costs of the restrictions because of Covid but also to help the economy recover, we still have a high level of public sector debt and a high level of public sector debt leaves an economy more vulnerable to unforeseen shocks that might come down the line.  For that reason more than any, a key element of our policy advice is when conditions allow - I emphasise that part because we are not currently in that state - it will be essential to return the public sector debt ratio to a lower, more sustainable level than the current level which is approximately 100% of national income.  Economic growth will do most of the heavy lifting in that regard but at the same time there is a need to think about a path to return the Government balance to a more sustainable situation that is compatible with a lower debt ratio.  Those are just some of the concerns that come to mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Have I time left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D01300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The Deputy has almost three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#D01400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>This is a general question and I do not need a particularly long answer.

Their actions caused an unprecedented economic crash and ordinary people paid the bill through income losses, job losses and crushing cuts to areas such as housing, health and education.  The people want to know that austerity is off the table and they are not going to be asked to pay the bill this time because it would be grossly unfair and counterproductive, as clearly was the case in previous cuts to areas such as healthcare, housing and education.  In the context of Covid, one thinks about the price that we are paying for the cuts and lack of investment in areas such as those.

Current Government policies are considerably reducing the costs and hardships of the crisis.  We saw that in some data we published recently where average wages would have declined and, in fact, average incomes in the economy increased last year due to the impact of Government supports.  That contribution was greater for lower-income groups.  Government policies have already had a positive effect.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is asking about the forward-looking situation, once the temporary supports that are now in place are removed and a recovery is under way.  The Deputy mentioned public sector investment.  Experience shows that it is extremely unwise for an economy to cut back on capital investment following an economic crisis because that has negative effects on the productive capacity of an economy in the long run.  That is a key lesson and a mistake was made in the past in that respect.  In Ireland, we did not have too much choice because we could not afford to borrow money at the time but investment certainly fell significantly here and elsewhere after the most recent crisis.  That has had significant negative effects.<\/p> <p>  Our advice and recommendation is that, first of all, current temporary policies remain necessary and they need not be removed prematurely.  When they are removed, attention needs to be focused on the recovery of the economy.  What will be most important there will be measures that reduce scarring effects, particularly long-term unemployment.  There will be structural changes.  In many ways, the economy will go back to where it was before but not fully.  There will be changes in consumer preferences, tastes and habits that have been picked up during the crisis that will be permanent.  We will have changes in commuting patterns because of working from home and that will have structural effects on the economy.  What policy can do there is to try to gear the economy towards the new reality, including the retraining and upskilling of people.  That is a significant way in which policy can have a positive effect.<\/p> <p>  I earlier mentioned enhancing the productive capacity of the economy.  In terms of paying the bill for Covid, I also mentioned the fact that we think the current situation is sustainable.  We do not think there is any need for what is commonly called austerity, albeit that can mean different things to different people.  Austerity is certainly not required to a degree whereby demand is removed from the economy at a time when the recovery is not established.  We firmly believe that when the time is right, public sector debt will need to return.  We think that economic growth will do much of the heavy lifting in that respect and that is another reason to emphasise the importance of capital investment.  We also think that the general situation in terms of Government balance, including the mix between current expenditure and taxation, will need to move to a more sustainable position, closer to balance or even surplus.  With regard to how that is done, I would be getting into a political decision with regard to the distributional effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#E01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Dr. Cassidy appears to be saying that there will be no austerity for now but the level of the debt we have taken on means the potential of some hard choices coming at a certain point.  Perhaps Dr. Cassidy will think this is getting into the political area, or whatever, but does he want to comment on the Oxfam report?  I know that the Central Bank produces reports on wealth and its distribution.  The Oxfam report, The Inequality Virus, states that, in Ireland and globally, huge numbers of ordinary people have lost jobs and incomes and have really suffered while a significant cohort of billionaires, the super wealthy and certain industries with which they are associated have done extraordinarily well and have seen their wealth increase significantly.  That is true in Ireland.  The report states that the wealth of Ireland's billionaires has increased by &euro;3.3 billion.  Has Dr. Cassidy any comment on that?  Do the Central Bank figures on wealth accumulation bear that out?

This is very important.  The European Commission issued an initial review of the framework in February.  Progress on that has understandably stalled since the pandemic has taken up attention, but it pointed to certain weaknesses in the fiscal framework from a backward-looking perspective.  Fiscal policies were often pro-cyclical and the composition of public finances was not as growth enhancing or encouraging of investment, including sustainable investment, as it might be.  The complexity of the fiscal framework, particularly in relation to matters such as structural balances which are very difficult to calculate and are largely outside Government control, is another issue.  The Government can decide how much it will spend but not necessarily how much it will take in.  These are all potential areas, flagged by the European Commission, where there will be some changes to the framework in future.<\/p> <p>  I cannot be too definitive because these are inherently political matters, but the simplicity versus the complexity of the framework should be considered.  Simpler rules on expenditure would be one option, rather than a focus on balances.  There is a certain degree of one size fits all when it comes to assessment of debt which focuses on a single figure - the debt ratio.  A broader understanding of an individual country's debt situation, the sustainability of its finances, and a distinction between good debt and bad debt is necessary.  Good debt is accrued for capital and environmental investment versus bad debt which is not productive.  Looking at what is underlying the debt and the sentiment of financial markets to further increases in debt are other issues.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues and an appetite for change in certain areas.  However, there are political issues and some countries will be more resistant to changes than others, so I do not know what the reality will be.

Regarding the short term, we published projections for inflation and the outlook is for it to remain modest in the coming years.  The announcements of the European Central Bank, ECB, on how long it expects to support monetary policy, both interest rates and asset purchases which put further downward pressure on Government borrowing costs, have clearly noted that support of an accommodative policy will remain in place for a while.  The asset purchases and interest rate will remain until at least March 2022 and possibly longer, depending on Covid.  The ECB projections are for inflation to be still below the global target of close to 2% by the end of its forecast horizon of 2023.<\/p> <p>  We do not expect to see the trends of higher inflation and higher interest rates in the short term.  Some of the risks of higher interest rates have been mitigated by the bond issuance of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which leaves our maturities and need to roll over debt in a very favourable position.  However, it is also the case that inflation and interest rates will increase at some stage.  The resilience of the economy will depend on how well placed it will be to withstand that.  I point particularly to the increase in interest rates.  If public sector debt is high, and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council published a useful document on this recently, there is significantly more vulnerability to higher interest rates when they occur.  At some stage, they will occur although I certainly will not put a time frame on it.  It is important that the economy is well placed.

One of the policy interventions that was made last year was an intervention that my party and I have been calling for in the context of how we might deal with a potential no-deal Brexit.  I refer to the introduction of the initial temporary wage subsidy scheme, which has since evolved into the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Would Dr. Cassidy be of the view, given the exposure of the locally traded sector to the decline we have experienced and the clear challenges that certain economic sectors will face in re-establishing themselves, that we should, as a feature of the labour market, have embedded into our system a formal short-time working scheme equivalent, for example, to the that which operates very successfully in Germany and which supported jobs and businesses through the financial crash in the late 2000s and early 2010s?  Is this something he thinks we should consider, perhaps with a condition attached around training and upskilling?  We have a serious issue on our hands in terms of productivity and competitiveness for SMEs and an ongoing challenge in the context of upskilling and retraining.

The T&aacute;naiste, as far as I am aware, did not put a timeframe on this.  If the view is that, at some time, the next moves in regard to inflation and interest rates is that they are likely to be up, that is the case.  I think what is uncertain is when that will happen.  I must just make that point.<\/p> <p>  What the Deputy is suggesting in terms of the wage subsidy scheme evolving into something more permanent is worth consideration.  He is talking about something that can reduce the risk that arises when a crisis happens and workers become disengaged from a firm for a period.  It may only be temporary but such a disengagement leads to longer-lasting effects.  There are potential schemes that could be used.  The EWSS was introduced, obviously, for temporary purposes, but the rationale behind it could potentially be considered as something more permanent.  I would not want to get into it any further than that except to agree with the Deputy that there is a lot of merit in what he is saying for reasons that relate to maintaining skills, motivation and engagement.  If a worker leaves a firm, even only temporarily, it becomes much more difficult to re-engage that individual.

First, it certainly is the case that multinational contribute significantly.  Their contribution is extremely welcome.  There are some issues in regard to the measurement of their output, but they contribute in a very real and meaningful way to export, employment and the public finances and also in terms of positive spillovers, including technology spillovers that help to upskill workers.  The multinationals make an extremely positive contribution but our output figures show quite a degree of reliance.  When that is the case, we need to look at whether the economy would be resilient in the event of either a firm-specific shock - we should keep in mind that a small number of firms dominate output in many of these sectors - or a sector-specific shock in a context where, for example, the pharmaceutical sector and the IT services sector dominate.  We need to ensure that we would be resilient in such an event.  We are not anticipating any reduction in the size of the multinational enterprise, MNE, sector but we want to be resilient because there is always a risk.<\/p> <p>  There are three things that need to be taken into consideration from a policy perspective.  First, policies need to remain supportive of the multinational sector.  We must remain a good place for multinationals to do business.  Most of these sectors have been embedded in the economy for a long time.  They are here for the long run and we need to make sure we remain a favourable location for business.  Second, we need to make sure that, complementary to the MNE sector, there is a successful Irish-owned sector.  It is indigenous SMEs that provide most of the employment - up to 1 million people - in this economy.  There are issues in this regard.  There is significantly weaker productivity among Irish-owned firms than there is among multinational firms.  Policy needs to ensure that we also have a productive, innovative and expanding indigenous sector.<\/p> <p>  The third point relates to corporation taxes.  We have developed a very high degree of reliance on those taxes.  I understand that 20% of our overall tax revenues now relate to corporation taxes, which is extremely high by historical standards.  That revenue source is dominated by multinationals and it means that if there were to be any shock to the overall balance between revenues and expenditure, it could be a shock akin to what happened when we had a degree of reliance on the construction sector back in the 2000s.  We need to ensure that our public finances are not overly reliant on the tax revenues from multinationals and that we do not make decisions about permanent spending increases based upon revenues from corporation taxes that could turn out not to be sustainable over the long term.  Again, I am not making a prediction in that regard.  It is just about being prudent in terms of management.  I would point to those policy areas in response to the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#G00900","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy for his presentation and for his informative responses to members' questions.<\/p><p>There are two or three areas I would like to tease out further.

Let me deal with those three issues in turn.  The first question highlights a clear gap in terms of people's experience during the crisis.  For those people who have not been directly affected by any income losses, what they have generally experienced is a significant increase in their savings, largely because they have not had the opportunities to spend because outlets have been closed down and, in fact, in the past year savings have increased by around &euro;15 billion.  We think there is now a significant stock of savings that will be important in terms of supporting the recovery when it happens.  On the other hand, there are many sectors of the economy very negatively affected, particularly those reliant on face-to-face contact, such as hospitality, large parts of retail and arts and entertainment.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the analysis of this.  We have done something on this and we published it last year.  First, the losses have been significantly mitigated by the effect of the Government supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Given that, for most of these small enterprises, wages represent a very large amount of their costs, this has reduced the potential cost.  At the same time, they also have significant non-wage costs and many SMEs have experienced losses on those.  Our estimates are that SMEs last year would have experienced overall losses of roughly between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion, which is very significant.  We think the Government measures had a significant effect but the other estimate that we have published is that, even allowing for the supports, close to 15%, or just over one sixth of SMEs, are unlikely to have the financial capacity to meet their liabilities during 2021.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, bringing all of that together, while the Government supports have had a significant effect, significant losses have been incurred by many SMEs, including many viable SMEs and many SMEs which came into this crisis in a good financial position.  However, if they are closed for 12 months of the year, of course, they are going to incur losses.

It shows that debt ratios have increased in many cases but, in fact, they have increased much less than they would have in the absence of supports.  I would emphasise that a lot of the issues will only become visible and evident once the supports are removed.  Once the supports are removed and the recovery starts, if there are people who do not return to work, and there will be people who do not return to work, for that cohort, that is when we may see the pressures on debt sustainability and mortgage arrears.  For that reason, we would expect to see some adverse impact on mortgage arrears arising from this pandemic, even if the figures are not yet visible because of the effect of income supports.  I would in no way want to sound complacent about what the lasting effects will be.<\/p> <p>  In terms of EU budgetary rules, I would not comment on what is appropriate but there is much to be considered.  There have been issues raised, first, that the current framework is overly complex; second, that it is not sufficiently supportive of growth and capital investment; and, third, that it is a little bit one-size-fits-all and does not take into account that a country's debt ratio is not the only metric one needs to look at.  There is also what that debt represents, whether it is debt that has been accrued because of capital; what does the market think regarding the sustainability of that debt; and, more important than anything else, what is the financing cost of that debt.  A 100% debt ratio at 0% interest is a lot better situation than a 100% debt ratio at 3% or 4% interest.<\/p> <p>  Those are the issues.  The process was paused last February when the European Commission first reported on the budgetary rules and, of course, the Stability and Growth Pact escape clause has been triggered and that will be extended for a while.  After the recovery starts, I think there is an opportunity to look again at the fiscal framework.  There is scope there but it is a political issue as to what changes will actually materialise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of interest rates and inflation, all I would say is that we do not see them increasing markedly in the near term, and I think there are reasons for that.  With regard to interest rates, the ECB is on the record as saying it expects its current asset purchases and its low interest rate environment to be in place for a while.

We use our economic modelling techniques to show the extent of that.  Our results show that an increase of that order, approximately &euro;5 billion or &euro;5.5 billion, would, if not funded, lead to a permanent increase in the general government deficit of approximately 1.5 percentage points.

That is very important and we see that when we expect the budget deficit to reduce to 4% next year.  That is because of an assumption that these temporary measures will not be in place and it shows how they are removed.  That is why we feel very confident in supporting the temporary measures that have been introduced.  They are affordable.  We think we will need to see a reduction in the public sector debt ratio at the right time.  We think economic growth will bear the brunt of that.  We think any policies that would restrict growth in the future, therefore, would be counterproductive.  We think, in addition to the impact of economic growth, that that budget balance will need to get down to balance and, if the economy gets back to full employment, ideally something of a small surplus.  The public finance position, the general government balance position, in addition to debt, will be important for that.  The balance, that is, what government expenditure goes on, is also critically important in that regard.  Capital spending is much more conducive to economic growth than current spending.

That contrasts significantly with other European countries, which saw roughly zero or even a fall in capital investment, so the evidence of the lessons having been learned here is quite apparent.

There will be requirements regarding how that money will be disbursed when we receive it.  There will be a need to take into consideration expenditure on climate-related matters.  Approximately 35% or 40% may need to go on climate.  There will also be a need to take into consideration productive investment, fairness and macro-stabilisation.  Essentially, the funding is for investment recovery and enhancing long-term potential, which is extremely appropriate.  In terms of the economic framework of the EU, measures that can enhance investment and improve environmental sustainability will be very appropriate.  I am not sure to what extent that would make its way to SMEs.  The &euro;1 billion I was talking about will be in the form of grants.

We heard this week that because of Ireland's GDP and our measurement of the economy in that way, we are going to receive fewer of those grants than we might otherwise be able to draw down.  During this session Dr. Cassidy outlined the three points relating to corporation tax - they are very good points - namely, that Ireland should remain a good place to do business, that we should have a successful indigenous sector and that we should not rely too much on corporation tax.  It seems, however, that while Ireland is losing out on those grants, the argument is that we are getting it back in corporation tax.  There is a qualitative difference between receiving corporation tax and being part of that recovery fund and those grants.

As a result of the presence of multinationals, it is well recognised that our headline GDP is overstated as a measure of the incomes of the economy.  GDP is probably in the region of 40% higher than GNI, which is what we get when we adjust for some of the practices of multinationals that relate to depreciation of intellectual property, depreciation of aircraft leasing and what is called contract manufacturing.  These are activities that do not really contribute to the Irish economy, but they do add to the headline GDP.  One impact of that is exactly what the Chairman mentioned, which is that it sometimes means our contributions or receipts to and from the EU are affected because the denominator is GDP rather than GNI*.  I have heard what the Chairman is describing in terms of what we receive but consider, for example, something rather simple.  If a country's contribution to the European Union is a percentage of its national income, and if GDP is used for Ireland, we are paying a much higher share than if GNI* was used.  It is the case that our contributions to, and in some cases returns from, the EU can be affected because of this measurement issue of national income.  I would not deny to that extent but in considering the contribution of multinationals, while corporation tax is important, it is only one element.  It is not just exports.  The overall multinational sector employs more than 350,000 people.  These are high-skilled jobs with above average wages.  They create a demand for skilled work and they have other spillovers in the environment and in local communities and also in terms of productivity and innovation technology.

For example, we do not know how spending patterns will change, which would mean that some of the temporary effects from the crisis may be sustained over time.  Some businesses that may have been viable going into the crisis may not be viable over the longer term.  Getting the balance right between, on the one hand, ensuring viable business, which is certainly for the economic benefit of the State, versus, on the other, keeping alive businesses that will not be viable over the longer term by allocating resources to those businesses that could be allocated elsewhere.

They do not include factors of wealth such as assets, housing or the like.  We have very good cross-country comparisons on income.  We have very poor cross-country comparisons on wealth because it is very difficult to compare many of the assets an economy might have in order to put a figure on those.  I might restrict the answer to income, which is what these measures relate to, and say two things about them.  We published something on this recently by our previous Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, which looks at different measures of income that are used and how each may not be appropriate and can give very misleading results.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, if we look at GDP, which is what most economists around the world use, Ireland comes out as the richest country, in income terms, in the European Union and the fifth richest in the world.  That is entirely misleading and it is because GDP is inflated by some factors relating to the multinational sectors that in no way benefit the incomes of the Irish economy.  If we look at alternative measures just for those, we are probably around eighth highest in the European Union.  That is probably a reasonably meaningful comparison.<\/p> <p>  Professor Honohan also looked at what happens if we adjust that for the prices people pay.  Two countries may have the same incomes but one may be paying twice as much for its goods and services, and even for housing costs within a year, than another.  Ireland has an extremely high price level compared with other European countries, so if we adjust for the price level, again, we are down around eighth to 12th in the European Union, which is more meaningful.<\/p> <p>  I would make one other point on that.  National income is purely a financial and monetary concept.  There are also broader measures of welfare which are extremely important to take into consideration.  They may also reflect health, education and measures of well-being and happiness within an economy.  These are more difficult to measure.  They may be more representative of welfare in one country compared with another.  There is one such measure that Professor Honohan's publication mentioned, which is a United Nations human development indicator.  It includes all of these and when that is properly measured for Ireland, again, we are somewhere around the middle of the pack in terms of measurement compared with other European countries.  My apologies for going back and forth with a couple of different concepts in respect of measurement but I hope what I said goes towards answering the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>It gives me an idea.

If prices are increasing fuelled by a lending boom - a credit boom - and people are purchasing houses not out of the income they are earning in work but are borrowing to do so and we get the same dynamic that we saw in the 2000s, and if there is a fixed supply of housing or housing that is increasing somewhat, people are borrowing more, which puts upward pressure on prices and means that other people coming after them have to borrow more again.  I suppose that price credit dynamic is what we would be most concerned with and we have very clear evidence from the past about what that can lead to.<\/p> <p>  The second comment I would make is that there is clearly an issue with regard to affordability of housing at the moment.  House prices are extremely high.  Many individuals and families cannot afford appropriate suitable accommodation, whether to rent or buy.  The issue very clearly for us is a shortage in the supply of housing.  That is a factor that needs to be addressed if that problem is to be overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021032300002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>On the issue of the shortage of supply, I have heard rumours to suggest that blocks of apartments throughout the country have been closed down.

I am accompanied by the Minister of State, who has responsibility for special education, and by officials from my Department.  I am conscious that I have very limited time in which to deliver my opening statement so I will just give a brief overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2021.<\/p> <p>  These Revised Estimates set out the approved allocations for the Department, including funding for all of the services normally provided or supported by it.  They also include substantial additional funding to meet costs associated with the reopening of schools and sustaining teaching and learning as part of the Covid-19 response covering the period to the end of the current school year.  The Revised Estimates also reflect the completion of the transfer of functions from the Department of Education to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the transfer into my Department of funding from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of certain education functions being performed by Tusla.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 26 provides for a net allocation of &euro;8.644 billion, representing a gross allocation of &euro;8.961 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of some &euro;300 million.  This represents an increase in gross expenditure of some &euro;250 million, or 3%, over the 2020 allocation.  I made the point previously to the committee that a significant proportion of the funding allocated to Vote 26 will be expended on gross pay and pensions, with sums amounting to over &euro;7 billion included in the Vote for these purposes.  This represents some 80% of the expenditure allocation.  Some 90,600 public servants and 43,200 public service pensioners are paid out of these funds.  Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, school transport, capitation grants to schools and grants to other organisations and agencies.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2021 included a number of measures relevant to the education system.  It included additional funding to enable the total number of non-Covid-related teaching posts to rise by 1,065 by the end of this year.  Of these posts, a net 268 will derive from forecast demographics.  Four hundred and three additional teachers will be working with children with special needs and there will be 394 new teaching posts created at primary level to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes.  This includes a new measure to assist schools to retain teachers while dealing with Covid-19 requirements.<\/p> <p>  The budget also included initiatives in the area of social inclusion, with additional funding being provided to reduce by one point the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, senior schools urban band-1 staffing schedule, and an additional &euro;2 million for Gaeltacht placement grants and &euro;1 million for the continued implementation of the Gaeltacht education policy.  An additional &euro;3.5 million has been provided to continue investment in the Creative Ireland and Music Generation programmes.<\/p> <p>   Special education continues to be a priority.  Almost 1,000 additional special needs assistant, SNA, posts will be allocated, bringing the total number of SNAs in our schools to over 18,000 in 2021.  This will support the rolling out of the new school inclusion model, including a new allocation methodology for mainstream schools in the 2021 school year, which will ensure students with additional needs get the right supports at the right time, as well as supporting the new special needs class places.<\/p> <p>  An additional 145 special education teacher posts will be provided for while 235 new teachers will be recruited to work in special classes in our schools, with another 23 teachers hired for special schools.  This investment in additional teaching posts will ensure that more than 1,200 new places in special classes will be provided.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 investment includes a capital allocation for new and more energy-efficient school buildings, with a &euro;740 million budget for 2021 under Project Ireland 2040.  This funding will sustain the rolling out of projects, including some 140 projects under the large-scale and additional accommodation schemes whose construction activity is due to commence before July 2021.  These projects will add significant additional capacity to the school system to manage in the Covid environment and to cater for increased demographics.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with a few words on Covid.  The Government's roadmap for the full reopening of schools, approved in July 2020, included a significant package of funding to sustain school reopening, for the replacement of teachers and non-teaching staff unable to attend for work due to Covid-19, additional release days for principals and deputy principals, and enhanced cleaning regimes, personal protective equipment, PPE, and well-being supports.  The total amount allocated for the 2020-2021 school year is &euro;639 million.  Of that, &euro;331 million related to 2020 and comprised a capital allocation of &euro;180 million and &euro;151 million in current funding.  The balance of that allocation, amounting to some &euro;308 million, is included in these Estimates.  This funding is, as before, available to meet substitution and supervision, cleaning, sanitiser, PPE and school transport costs.  No Covid-related capital allocation has been included in these Estimates.  There was very significant Covid-related capital expenditure in 2020, much of it brought forward.  As with other Covid-19 related spending, funding for the 2021-2022 school year will be reviewed in line with the latest public health advice available and previous Covid-19 costs.  In this regard, a central contingency reserve was allocated in the 2021 budget by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which includes funds specifically earmarked for schools for the remainder of 2021, that is, for the period from August to December.<\/p> <p>  The committee will appreciate that the position on Covid remains fluid.  The education sector is in the process of reopening and I expect that all schools will be open again on 5 April.  The leaving certificate examinations will take place in June and a system of accredited grades will be available.  A very significant allocation of funding has been made in these Estimates to sustain reopening and to ensure the welfare of staff and students.  I trust that this brief overview has been of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail.  I commend the Revised Estimate for 2021 to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#A00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

For example, as the committee will be aware, there have been several reforms in the overall budgetary framework in recent years to provide greater transparency, including whole-year engagement between Departments and Oireachtas committees like this one.  The reforms have included, for example, the introduction of performance and equality budgeting.  It has included mid-term expenditure reviews and reports.  It has included independent scrutiny by the Parliamentary Budget Office, including PBO papers, the public service performance report and spending review papers.  Considerable effort has been made to make the information more user-friendly and more transparent, not just for the benefit of the committees but for the benefit of all concerned.<\/p> <p>  Regarding reductions this year, at the end of 2020, moneys that were due to be expended in 2021 were made available to schools to spend at the end of 2020.

That accounts for any discrepancy.  There is no reduction; it is just that the money was given towards the end of 2020 to allow schools make the necessary provision for any building works that needed to be carried out or make improvements to digital access.  For example, many schools chose to purchase equipment and provide it to children who were in need of it.  The work on the purchase of platforms had previously been done.

I have two specific questions.  One relates to the funding that has been put aside or prioritised to ensure children can catch up and not just that they can return to school.  In addition to making adjustments to schools and providing more personal protective equipment, PPE, or hand sanitiser, they need to be able to ensure children can regain what they lost.  What funding is available in that regard?  I have previously spoken to the Minister about the &pound;1 billion catch-up fund for children in the UK.  There do not appear to be specific measures in place for children, especially those from a disadvantaged background, to analyse and then to ensure they can repair some of the damage caused by not being in school, notwithstanding that they were being taught or that efforts were made to teach them as best we could.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to demographic pressures.  In my constituency many parents cannot find a place for their child at second level.  This may be more of a policy measure than a financial one.  What kind of funding mechanisms does the Department have to ensure areas of the country undergoing demographic pressures can have increased access to second level schools?<\/p> <p>  I have a further question on face coverings for oral exams, but that may be a discussion for a different time.  Perhaps the Minister could communicate with me separately on that.  I ask her to respond on the catch-up fund for children and on investments to ensure the pressures as a result of demographic changes can be eased to allow for greater access to second level places.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#C00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>On the catch-up fund and funding being made available to schools, the Deputy rightly made reference to disadvantaged children.  Some &euro;150 million a year is allocated to our DEIS schools.  As I have said, in excess of &euro;639 million has been expended on schools' reopening.  We are working on an extended or enhanced summer provision programme which will help in compensating for a loss of in-person teaching and learning experiences.  The Deputy will be aware the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has made available a &euro;2.1 billion contingency fund for Covid-19.  The Department of Education is a named Department in that respect.  Obviously, we will be looking to access funding from there.<\/p> <p>  We have recently announced measures to extend the school completion programme.  We are working on the provision of the extended summer programme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the demographic issues in his own area in north Dublin and he has raised this with me previously.  I will give it some context.  There are 314 school planning areas which use the geographical information system containing data compiled from a variety of sources.  Conscious that major new residential developments, including some in the Deputy's own area, can add to pressure within an area, the Department now also liaises with local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  I am cognisant that specific issues in an area may arise for a variety of reasons, including duplication of applications and parents being particular about the school they want to choose.<\/p><p>There may be an external draw where pupils are coming from outside a local area.

We are conscious that we are currently working with the patrons and the schools to address any issues in that specific area and that we have planning exemptions which can be used to provide for any additional temporary accommodation on school sites.  We now also have a modular accommodation framework in place to shorten the procurement timeline.  The Department is satisfied, specifically with regard to that particular area, that requirements for September 2021 and beyond can be met.

Our report recommends that the provision of hot meals to vulnerable students should be expanded to cover periods of school closures and holidays, and that a hot meals programme should be rolled out nationally to all schools on a phased basis.  For those children in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion the problems will go much further, extending even to difficulties accessing basic nutrition during the school week.  It is an area on which we need to work hard to protect and improve the situation.  I acknowledge that the Government has made some progress in terms of rolling out and expanding the school meals programme that is already in place but we must avoid losing focus in this important area.  What other actions are planned to make sure we improve this area and improve the outcomes for children who are disadvantaged with regard to the school meals?<\/p> <p>  My next question refers to our report's finding that primary schools receive significantly less funding than secondary schools.  There is also a specific issue regarding the number of school management posts.  We were of the view as a committee that there is now a need for a review of the short-term funding needs of schools.  A more fundamental review of funding, however, also needs to be carried out in order that the requisite school management is in place to provide quality leadership for the whole school community.  What is the Minister's view on that issue?  How does she expect to resolve this matter?  Does she feel a review is necessary with regard to this ongoing problem in terms of the shortfall in funding for primary schools, but also in terms of school management posts, particularly in post-primary schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#D00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  She referenced the hot meal programme.  I absolutely agree with her that it is a hugely important programme within our schools.  It is funded through the Department of Social Protection and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has responsibility for that programme.  This obviously is done in co-operation with my Department but the funding actually comes from elsewhere.  I recognise absolutely its importance on the ground, particularly, as the Deputy referenced, for children who might have particular disadvantages.  It has and continues to run successfully.  A further extension of the budget was provided this year from the Department of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in order that the hot meal programme could be extended.  I acknowledge how important that is within the schools.  Obviously, we will continue to seek the largest possible roll-out of that initiative.  It is of immense benefit.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the funding for primary schools, again, I will point out the enormous amounts of money in terms of grants and supports for schools this year.  Not least, for example, in the primary school sector, where there has been a considerable roll-out of minor works grants.  I wish to acknowledge the tremendous manner in which all schools, and as the Deputy referenced in this instance, primary schools, utilised that funding to reimagine, add additionality to and make spaces available within schools and do the necessary work.  I accept that the money was timely for many primary schools, even outside of a Covid-19 atmosphere.  I am committed to schemes of that nature, including the emergency work, summer work and minor work schemes continuing into the future to support works that are needed on the ground.<\/p> <p>  On comparability with primary and secondary level, which was raised previously by Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, we are really speaking about two very different experiences in terms of sizes of buildings, types of rooms and so forth.  There is not, therefore, a specific comparability.  I want to make it clear, however, that there has been a significant increase in funding this year for the primary school sector going forward.  There has been significant additionality even in terms of initiatives that have been brought in, whether it is the substitution panels being made available to schools or the additional days for teaching principals being made available this year.  All of these are to the necessary benefit of schools and the work of principals and staff on the ground.  It is my intention to ensure that we support those initiatives to the very best of our capacity going forward, within budgetary constraints, to ensure services that need to be provided, both from a structural and a service point of view in primary schools, will continue to be well-supported financially .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#D00400","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We are very cognisant of that in the Covid-19 atmosphere.  More than &euro;100 million was paid out last year, with the last &euro;50 million of that paid out in December to facilitate schools to purchase the equipment and then - and I have seen this operate on the ground - the equipment is loaned to individual students, families or whomever as the case might arise.  I am very conscious that no two schools will have the same needs or demands placed upon them in terms of the digital devices the Chairman specifically raised.

I am accompanied today by the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, who has responsibility for skills and further education and by officials from the Department.  I am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement so I will be very brief and give an overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2021.  I can pick up on issues in the exchanges with members.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for the Department&rsquo;s 2021 Estimate was drawn up in late 2020 as part of the 2021 Estimates process, which allocated an additional &euro;236 million.  The increased allocation for the Department allowed me to fund a number of major priorities, including provision for increased undergraduate places to support leaving certificate students, meeting demographic increases and support skills development, increasing supports for postgraduate students in the SUSI scheme and increasing the allocation to meet demand for SUSI grants, increasing funding for access programmes, providing additional funding to support the research system, and investing in skills provision, particularly as we try to rebuild and repair after the Covid pandemic.  These measures were in addition to the Covid supports provided to the further and higher education sector and to students during 2020.  In total, these supports amounted to &euro;216 million, with an additional &euro;100 million for skills provision from the National Training Fund.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s capital ceiling was also increased, and funding was also provided to meet the costs associated with the public sector pay deal.  Indeed, 47% of the Department&rsquo;s gross Vote is allocated to pay and pensions, reflecting the crucial work our public servants carry out in the further and higher education system and in the science and innovation sector.  This Department provides the funding for more than 25,000 public servants and more than 11,000 public servant pensioners.<\/p> <p>  Today marks the first time the Department&rsquo;s Vote inclusive of research, innovation and science funding will be discussed at the committee.  In many ways, the timing could not be better, as on 8 March we launched the new Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy.  This outlines our goals to develop talent and skills, support learning for all, and promote Irish research, knowledge and innovation on the world stage.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 45 before the committee provides for a net allocation of &euro;2.7 billion, representing a gross allocation of &euro;2.8 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of &euro;100 million.  When taken with the National Training Fund expenditure available, the overall gross expenditure allocation for my Department in 2021 increases to &euro;3.5 billion.<\/p> <p>  The Vote 45 allocation comprises a number of key elements.  These are an allocation of more than &euro;2.5 billion to meet the various requirements of the Department in the areas of further and higher education, including some increase during the 2021 Estimates process reflecting the public sector pay deal, an increase to the capital ceiling and other assorted expenditure, the transfer of &euro;226 million in funding from Vote 32 relating to research, innovation and science along with additional research funding secured as part of the budget for 2021, and an allocation of &euro;20 million in budget 2021 to fund Covid-19 student grants through Student Universal Support Ireland in the face of the ongoing pandemic.<\/p> <p>  We are all well aware of the profound impact that Covid-19 has had globally over the past year.  I place on record my gratitude to all involved in ensuring the continued health and safety of our students, lecturers and researchers, and to those working on a plan to safely reopen our institutions and establishments as much as possible in the near future.  I want to students to have more on-site attendance in the next academic year.  I pay tribute to students.  Sometimes there can be an unfair narrative about students.  They have overwhelmingly worked to follow the public health advice and play their part in the national effort against Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  I trust this overview is of some assistance to the committee and I look forward to discussing these issues in more detail.  I commend the Revised Estimate to the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#G00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and join him in commending students on the huge work they have done this year and on everything they have done to maintain safety, working with other students to support them.

My next question is on CAO places and the pressure on the leaving certificate.  Is the Minister satisfied the budget will be able to do enough to bring additional places into third level to ease the pressure on the CAO system?  How many additional places will be added for undergraduate students coming through the CAO system in 2021?  How many of these will be over and above the number projected to meet demographic demands?  Specifically with regard to graduate entry medical students, excluding places for international students and places already allocated to those who sat the leaving certificate last November, how many medical places will be available to the class of 2021?

I will try to take the questions in sequence.  The year-on-year movement for higher education is skewed due to the temporary Covid funding in 2020.<\/p><p>Of the &euro;216 million allocated to my Department for Covid in 2020, &euro;202 million was allocated to higher education.  Removing Covid from the 2020 and the 2021 figures shows that the higher education programme B has actually increased year on year by &euro;161 million.  This is driven by measures in budget 2021.  University and institute of technology grants, which come under subhead B4 and which I believe the Deputy is referring to, had &euro;156 million in temporary Covid support in 2020.  This skews the figure when comparing year on year.  When one excludes that temporary funding, the real movement year on year under subhead B4 is an increase of 6%, or &euro;58 million.  This is driven by additional funding in budget 2021 for pay deals, research and additional calculated grade places.  As the committee will be aware, the Government holds Covid money for this year centrally.  My Department is expecting to receive an allocation of this money in the coming weeks as we work through the impact of Covid.  Year on year and like for like, the level of funding under the general current grants in subhead B4 is up 6%.  That is the reason the 9% is skewed.  I hope I got all the Deputy's questions.  If I did not, she should please come back to me.<\/p><p> On places, as of now and standing still based on the budget allocation, we have funding to provide 4,130 additional higher education places this September compared with last year.  Of these, 2,700 are based on demographic projections and the remainder are based on the human capital initiative.  Today we have the funding in place for just over 4,000 additional places.  The challenge that has been put to me is can we do more above and beyond that.  I believe we can.  I have set up a working group in the Department which is working with the CAO, the universities and the institutes.  It will report back to me just after Easter, at which time I intend to go to Cabinet to say what more we will be able to do, subject to the Government making funding available.<\/p><p> There are some constraints, mainly in the context of placements.  It is important, in many areas, that for any extra place we create, we must also have a matching placement.  We will be linking with the Department of Health for nursing and medical placements and with the Department of Education in the context of teaching placements.  On a specific answer regarding the medical places and on how many additional places there will be above and beyond the 4,000, we will have clarity next month.  I will be happy to come back to the committee with a detailed note or to engage with it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021032300002#G00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We have already started to engage with the steering group we have in place in respect of the implementation of a national access plan.  It is fair to say that when we look at the existing access plan, we see improvements in pretty much all areas.  There is an area that we have not seen the improvement we would wish to see, namely, that relating to mature students.  There is a major opportunity arising from Covid.  We must try to find the opportunities in the context of delivering education in a more flexible way and ensuring that mature students can access education in an easier way.  We will look to set targets and new types of targets around access.  I am very concerned that when we measure disability we only measure some disabilities.  I do not believe there is a broad enough metric in that regard.  Through public consultation there will be an opportunity for everyone to make their views known, probably over the summer months.  I would also be very happy to make officials available to this committee in getting the views of the committee on how we can have the most robust national access plan possible.

It is slow progress and I would like to see more done.  I am glad that the information was presented.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to my questions.  Is there a specific funding provision for technological university, TU, projects?  Will the Minister consider enacting legislation to allow the technological universities to borrow in the same way that the regular universities do so there is a funding stream apart from a the Central Fund and the Exchequer?<\/p> <p>  Referring to appendix B on apprenticeships, our output target in 2020 was 20,000.  Our output target in 2021 is only 21,000.  This is a very modest increase.  This question is to the Minister of State.  Are we really hoping to ramp up our ambition here?  I am thinking specifically of our retrofit targets.<\/p> <p>  Subheads A1 and B1 both have a 17% or 18% increase in administration costs.  I am always wary when I see a jump in administration costs.  Is further detail available on that?<\/p> <p>  Subhead B5 deals with teacher training colleges.  I wonder where this will end up.  Will it end up in second level with the Minister for Education's Department or the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science's Department?  Are there any plans for developing an Irish language training college for primary level, which is sorely needed?<\/p> <p>  I am sorry for rattling so many questions at the Ministers, but my final question is on subhead B17 and public private partnerships.

This is given out over a number of years.  The Deputy will be familiar with that.  The Government has, to date, invested heavily in the TU agenda with more than &euro;65 million invested so far through landscape and transformation funding.  The transformation fund will expend &euro;90 million up to 2023, with &euro;34.3 million having been allocated in the first tranche last October.  In total, more than &euro;120 million will have been invested in TU development and progression.<\/p> <p>  I assure the committee there is no lack of commitment to ensuring that all areas can benefit from the region-centric and multi-campus TU.

Following on from our meeting with D&oacute;chas and others last October regarding the implementation of the UN's sustainable development goals, SDGs, it is timely and right that we have the opportunity today to discuss SDG 5, achieving gender equality.  On behalf of the committee, I am very pleased to welcome: Ms Mary Van Lieshout, deputy CEO of GOAL; Ms Karol Balfe, head of tackling violence and building peace at Christian Aid Ireland; Ms Maeve Taylor, director of advocacy and communications of the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA; Ms Louise Winstanley of ABColombia; and Ms Suzanne Keatinge, CEO, and Ms Louise Finan, head of policy, of D&oacute;chas.  I particularly welcome Ms Muna Abbas, country director with Plan International, who joins us from Jordan.<\/p> <p>  I begin with a brief word on our format in terms of privilege and process.  Witnesses and guests are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as in any way adverse or damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, speakers will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I am sure there will be no need to make any such direction and, if there is, that it will be complied with immediately.  For any of our witnesses who are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, which I understand is all of them, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as would a witness who is physically present.  Guests participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are further advised to be mindful of domestic law and how it might apply to any evidence given or tendered.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  I draw it to the attention of anyone watching this meeting online that some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting in a remote format.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everybody exercise forbearance in the event of any technical issues that may arise and interfere with proceedings.<\/p> <p>  I call on Ms Van Lieshout to give her opening remarks and introduce us to the other witnesses, who may then give their opening remarks.  After that, we will proceed to observations and questions from committee members.  I ask members and guests to be mindful that we must bring our proceedings to a conclusion within a period of two hours from when the meeting started, in accordance with Covid regulations.  Ms Van Lieshout has the floor and she is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#A00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity for members of D&oacute;chas, the Irish network of international, development and humanitarian organisations, to brief members on the impact the Covid-19 crisis has had on progress towards gender equality globally.  The last time a representative of D&oacute;chas appeared before the committee, in October 2020, there was a discussion on the implementation of the sustainable development goals, both in Ireland and overseas.  SDG 5, achieving gender equality, means we commit to ending all forms of discrimination, violence and harmful practices against women and girls everywhere.  It means recognising the value of unpaid care and domestic work.  It means ensuring women's full and effective participation, and equal opportunities for leadership, at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.  It means ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health, reproductive rights and economic rights and resources.  Above all, SDG 5 means that governments must adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at all levels.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased to be appearing before the committee this month as it coincides with a number of global events on gender equality.  The 65th sessions of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the UN's largest annual gathering on gender equality and women's empowerment, is taking place currently.<\/p><p>The Generation Equality Forum, organised by UN women and co-hosted by France and Mexico, will begin at the end of March having been delayed by a year because of Covid-19.  It is timely also that we discuss this issue today as the Citizens' Assembly in Ireland resumes its work exploring recommendations to advance gender equality.  Our efforts at home are inextricably linked with efforts at the EU, regionally and internationally to ensure women's rights.<\/p><p> It is more than 25 years since the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action were agreed at the Fourth World Conference on Women when 189 states, including Ireland, declared their determination to advance the goals of equality, development and peace for all women everywhere in the interest of all humanity.  Since then, we know that progress on gender equality has seen some positive steps forward but progress has been all too slow.  Not a single country today can claim to have achieved gender equality, nor can any country claim to be one where women feel completely safe on our streets, as the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard while walking home in London demonstrates.  This must change.<\/p><p> Today, however, we wish to focus on the specific impacts Covid-19 has had on women and girls across the world and we ask this committee to become a champion for them.  The UN Secretary General, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, recently said that gender equality was the world's biggest human rights scourge and the Covid-19 crisis has a woman&rsquo;s face.  He said, &ldquo;Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage.&rdquo;<\/p><p> Goal is very conscious of the impact of Covid-19 on achieving gender equality and our teams are seeing first-hand how violence against women and girls in all forms has escalated.  In response, we are integrating gender-based violence and child protection messaging into our Covid-19 awareness campaigns.  In Zimbabwe, for example, Goal is including gender-based violence, GBV, protection messaging into its Covid-19 campaign, which to date has reached 2.8 million people.  We know also that women's jobs are two times more vulnerable than men's and, indeed, we are currently seeing large volumes of women leaving the workforce as a result of the pandemic.<\/p><p> To speak to these issues in more detail, I am delighted to be accompanied today by colleagues from Plan International in Jordan, Christian Aid Ireland's partner, ABColombia, and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPS, who will speak of the impact of the pandemic on girls' education, displacement, conflict and reproductive health.  What each theme has in common is that there must be a renewed urgency to finding gender transformative policy responses that not only build back better, but in a more equal way.  We need to ensure that Ireland, in every facet of its foreign policy, positions gender equality at the centre of its approach towards a healthy and peaceful world.  In effect, Ireland must develop on goal 5 of the sustainable development goals by 2030.<\/p><p> Today we have four specific asks of the committee.  Our first ask is that the committee assists us in ensuring there is a more robust tracking of Ireland's progress in furthering the SDG agenda in its partner countries and internationally, including tracking data on marginalised groups which include women and girls and people living with disabilities.<\/p><p> We ask the committee also to support the EU's Gender Action Plan and call on the Irish Government to swiftly operationalise it, including the commitment to allocate 85% of overseas development aid, ODA, to programmes which have gender equality as their principle objective, and to support the implementation of a gender responsive recovery plan from Covid-19.<\/p><p> Third, we ask that the committee support Ireland's international commitment in its A Better World policy to addressing girls' education as a priority.  We need a clear roadmap that outlines how Irish Aid intends to commit to and spend at least &euro;250 million over five years on global education.<\/p><p> Finally, we ask the committee to work with the Irish Government to ensure it uses its voice on the UN Security Council to encourage all countries to fully implement the commitments in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, better known as CEDAW.<\/p><p> Ireland has been a champion for women, peace and security and we want to see that champion work on gender equality more broadly.  I thank the committee for its support for these asks.  I will now hand over to Ms Muna Abbas, head of mission and country director with Plan International in Jordan, who will speak to the committee about the situation in Jordan with respect to girls' education, Covid-19 and displacement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Van Lieshout.  I thank the Chairman and respected committee members.  It is my pleasure to be with the committee this morning.<\/p> <p>  While the Syrian crisis marks its tenth year this month, 40% of children under the age of 18 are registered as refugees.  Jordan and Lebanon, as neighbouring countries, host the highest percentage of refugees globally when compared to the local population.  Both Jordan and Lebanon are countries with limited resources where governments have already been struggling to respond to the needs of their own citizens, a situation that puts these countries at high risk of instability.<\/p> <p>  In Jordan, for example, 90,000 Syrian refugee children were reported to be out of school in 2019.  This number is expected to be dramatically increased during the pandemic as the Government has closed schools and other learning spaces in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus.<\/p> <p>  In such a complex context, girls are the most affected as they can be subjected to gender-based violence, including early marriage.  When we say, \"early marriage\", we mean marriage under the age of 18.  Eventually, they are deprived of their right to education while also not having access to vital services for protection, nutrition, health and well-being.  Before the conflict, 13% of Syrian women aged between 20 to 35 were married before the age of 18.  Now, among Syrian refugees living in Jordan, rates have risen to as high as 29%. <\/p> <p>  In assessments conducted by Plan International in Jordan jointly with the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown on girls, results show that adolescent girls have high household burdens and fewer positive outlets.  Girls are busier doing household chores as well as taking care of younger children and helping them with their studies.  All this means less time for adolescent girls to focus on their own education.<\/p> <p>  The gender digital divide whereby girls have reduced access to information and communication technology translates into reduced learning opportunities during school closures.  For example, the average cost for Internet services per household in Jordan is approximately $50 per month, which most families cannot afford, especially during the pandemic and lockdown and particularly among Syrian refugee families.  Girls also reported that they have less access to tech devices such as mobile telephones, tablets and computers compared with boys in the same family.<\/p> <p>  With the support of Irish Aid and other donors, over the past four years we were able to support thousands of Syrians and vulnerable Jordanian children, mainly girls, to access educational opportunities.  During the pandemic last year, hundreds of girls were supported to attend online classes by providing them with electronic devices and Internet connectivity.<\/p> <p>  The needs are huge and they are still here.  An entire generation is at risk.  We know we can help and how we can do so.  We believe that together we can make a difference to those children's lives.  I thank the committee.  I will hand over to Ms Winstanly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Muna Abbas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Agenda 2030 for the UN sustainable development goals recognises that development cannot be achieved without addressing violent conflict and building peace.  In 2016, more countries were experiencing violent conflict than at any other time in the previous 30 years.  Much of this violence is due to reoccurring and protracted conflicts.  ABColombia is a partner of Christian Aid Ireland.<\/p><p>For the next few minutes I will focus on Colombia.<\/p><p> Ireland has a long history of supporting peace in Colombia and this year it is particularly crucial.  November will mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the peace accord, which is currently in a very fragile state.  In 2020, there was a quadrupling of the number of victims of massacres and combat increased by 65% compared with the last year before the signing of the peace accord.  In January this year, over 11,000 people were forced to displace due to armed conflict as neo-paramilitary and other armed groups expanded their control over communities, territory and illicit economies.  Targeted killings have also resulted in over 400 human rights defenders and 261 former FARC combatants being killed since 2016.<\/p><p> The coronavirus pandemic has played into this context, particularly affecting women and aggravating inequality and poverty.  Women's participation in the labour market has fallen to the level of ten years ago as the pandemic hit the informal work in which women were engaged particularly hard.  Confinement as a measure against coronavirus has meant those threatening women human rights defenders have been easily able to locate them.  Many women defenders have been shot in or near their homes.  Domestic violence has increased, as have femicides.<\/p><p> The conflict has left many women as heads of household, widening the inequality gap, and sexual and gender violence has been perpetrated as a weapon of war.  One of the unique features of the Colombian peace accord is that it wove into all the agreements specific gender provisions.  These gender provisions have the potential for structural change by reducing gender inequalities and furthering the rights of rural women, which is why when considering gender, peace and development in Colombia, the peace accord in an important roadmap not only for peace building but also for good governance policies.<\/p><p> Comprehensive implementation of these programmes would contribute to gender empowerment and equality.  However, for the peace accord to be implemented, it is essential to address the escalating violence by near-paramilitary and other criminal groups.  These groups will only effectively be dismantled if the intellectual authors are identified and prosecuted and their sources of finance and political protection are cut off.  Ireland, with its position on the UN Security Council, should call for that body to establish an independent group or panel of experts on organised crime to examine the position in Colombia.  A technical report from an independent group of experts would strengthen the work of the UN mission of verification to Colombia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, both of which have security guarantees within their mandates.  Such a report would also assist Colombia in the design and implementation of a public policy to facilitate the identification and prosecution of the intellectual authors and a dismantling of these groups.<\/p><p> Colombia is a country which, compared with many other complex cases of conflict around the world, has a real possibility of achieving peace.  It needs a country like Ireland to throw its weight and experience behind achieving the appointment of UN Security Council group of experts on organised crime that can offer the technical expertise that Colombia needs now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Winstanley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Good morning and I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I will specifically address the question of sexual and reproductive health rights as an aspect of gender equality.  The Irish Family Planning Association is the secretariat to the all-party Oireachtas interest group on sexual and reproductive health and the Irish collaborating partner of the UN Population Fund, UNFPA.  It is also a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation.<\/p> <p>  I will start with A Better World, Ireland's policy for international development, which is grounded, as members know, in human rights and the sustainable development goals.  It recognises sexual and reproductive health rights as central to gender equality and universal health coverage.  A Better World commits Ireland to advancing and protecting the programme of action of the International Conference on Population and Development, including action on sexual and reproductive health.  According to A Better World, access to health services, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, is fundamental to realising sexual and reproductive health rights and for transforming women's health outcomes.  The pandemic has had a devastating impact on women's and girls' access to basic health services, including family planning.  I will concentrate on three aspects, which are sexual and reproductive health and rights, female genital mutilation and child marriage and access to contraception.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, in a policy brief on the impact of the pandemic on women, the UN Secretary General outlined the unique health needs of women and girls and also the social norms and gender stereotypes that act as barriers to services.  My colleagues have mentioned some of these.  According to the report, the diversion of attention and critical resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health services can result in exacerbated maternal mortality and morbidity, increased rates of adolescent pregnancies, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.<\/p> <p>  Last November, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brophy, launched the 2020 State of World Population report, which is published each year by UNFPA, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency.  The report estimated the impact of the pandemic on girls and according to the report, programmes designed to promote gender equality by ending practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation are facing serious delays in implementation.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Abbas, has already raised the question of child marriage.  According to the UNFPA, at a conservative estimate, a one-year average delay in interventions to end child marriage could lead to over 7 million more child marriages over the next decade that could otherwise have been averted.  In addition, the State of World Population report projected that financial insecurities caused by the pandemic could result in 5.6 million additional child marriages taking place between 2020 and 2030.  The total effect of Covid-19 could therefore potentially result in 13 million additional child marriages that would not otherwise have happened.<\/p> <p>  On the question of female genital mutilation, the UNFPA predicts an estimated two-year delay in prevention programmes would lead to 2 million cases of female genital mutilation over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.  In that respect progress towards the elimination of female genital mutilation, which is target 5.5 of the sustainable development goals, could be reduced by a third.<\/p> <p>  The UNFPA also conducted analysis in 115 low and middle income countries in January this year.  The research suggests that while many countries were able to maintain or restore access to essential services, an estimated 12 million women may have been unable to access family planning services during the pandemic, with disruption of supplies and services lasting an average of 3.6 months.  As a result of these disruptions, as many as 1.4 million unintended pregnancies may have occurred before women were able to resume use of these services.<\/p> <p>  The forthcoming session of the Commission on Population and Development, which will be in April 2021, will focus on the impact of Covid-19 on sexual and reproductive health in the context of population, food security, nutrition and sustainable development.  These are the four key principles of Irish Aid's programme.  In advance of the commission, the UN Secretary General has called for coverage of sexual and reproductive healthcare to be prioritised as integral to sustainable development.  He has highlighted the need for family planning, emergency contraception, the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, post-abortion care and, where legal, safe abortion services to the full extent of the law.<\/p> <p>   Female genital mutilation, child marriage and unintended pregnancy have a devastating impact on girls, affecting physical and mental health, their ability to stay in education, the capacity to reach full potential as women, citizens, workers and leaders.  Investment in sexual and reproductive health will have transformative effects on gender equality and women's empowerment.  This includes programmes that support the right of women and couples to choose the number and spacing of any children they opt to have.  We can reduce unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion through the provision of comprehensive sexuality education, contraception and safe and legal abortion care.  However, UNFPA, in its 2020 pandemic response plan, identified a funding gap of approximately US$276 million that would be required to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of those in humanitarian, fragile and development contexts.<\/p><p>Ireland is a consistent supporter of the UNFPA, which oversees implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, agenda.  Ireland contributes core funding of approximately &euro;3.5 million a year.  Ireland supports reproductive health initiatives through its bilateral programme and is highly regarded by its partners for a strategic approach that sees gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights as indispensable to sustainable development.  This support must be maintained, expanded and increased if efforts to build forward better are to meaningfully address gender equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Taylor.

They are very much appreciated.  They contained some useful information but also some stark and worrying statistics and information.  I appreciate the opportunity to engage with the witnesses and to ask questions.  I agree totally with the comment that gender inequality is one of the world's greatest human rights scourges.  That is a very important point to make at this stage and a very important starting point for us all.  It is important to address the human rights scourge that is gender inequality.  We see human rights as the bedrock of everything we do and everything we should do, but we also see how human rights defenders across the world, particularly women human rights defenders, are targeted and imprisoned.  I have addressed this issue on many occasions.  In countries such as Saudi Arabia, female human rights defenders are imprisoned for doing such basic things as applying for a job within the UN.  These are big issues that we need to get on top of if we are serious about addressing human rights abuses.<\/p> <p>  Covid has shown up many difficulties and highlighted many areas in which gender inequality is rife.  It is has also highlighted other challenges with regard to domestic violence.  This has, of course, been with us for far too long but it has become more prevalent over the past year or so.  I have engaged with a number of organisations that deal with domestic violence in Ireland.  Only last week, I met a group in my constituency of Wicklow: Bray Women's Refuge.  Those I met with unfortunately painted a very stark picture with regard to how bad the problem has become over the past year.  We have such supports in our country, although unfortunately not at the level needed, but I can only imagine how women must feel in less well off, developing countries where there are not such supports.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has done a great deal to address the issues of inequality and gender inequality but we are not doing enough with regard to the SDGs, particularly the fifth goal, which concerns gender inequality.  I believe we are ranked tenth in the statistics for 2020, which shows that we have a long way to go if Ireland is to be in a position to say we are doing everything we can.  In its report, Social Justice Ireland states that Ireland needs to do much more to accelerate progress in this regard within our country.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the four asks the witnesses have made, the first is to ensure more robust tracking of Ireland's progress in furthering the sustainable development agenda.  Will they elaborate in that regard?  <\/p> <p>  Another area in which I am very interested is Colombia.  I welcome the report on Colombia.  Other committee members and I have raised the matter of the serious issues within that country.  It is interesting to see how the situation is impacting on women in Colombia in particular.  I have made reference to certain statistics previously with regard to human rights defenders, including former members of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, and other community activists, who have been targeted since 2016.  This is a very useful report of which we, as committee members, should take heed and feed into our deliberations as we engage with some of the organisations that are also on the ground in Colombia and the Colombian ambassador to Ireland in the coming while.  We have also asked for an engagement with Eamon Gilmore, who has played a very important role in the peace process in Colombia.  The report is very welcome, albeit very stark.  It shows that more than 400 human rights defenders have been murdered since the peace process commenced.<\/p> <p>  The issues in Jordan are again very stark.  This committee did some important work last week in marking the grim fact of the tenth year of conflict within Syria and the human impact this has had with regard to displaced people in Jordan and other neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon.  It is really important to see the impact this conflict is having with regard to education and gender inequality.  I appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I have one final point to make.  It has regard to Covid, which has had a very serious impact globally.  Some of the statistics as to how it has unfortunately impacted more on women are very grim and very stark.  Again, this committee did some important work on the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine to developing countries.  We had some excellent contributors to our deliberations, including Dr. David Nabarro, Dr. Kieran Harkin and a number of other important people, who painted a  grim picture as to the inequality in the roll-out of vaccines.  Some stark information as to price was given.  Some pharmaceutical companies are making massive profits from the vaccines.  There is inequality involved.  For example, a dose of one of the vaccines costs &euro;2.50 in Europe but &euro;5.80 is charged in Uganda for the same dose.  One of the major calls made by all of those people with which we engaged, which was reflected in one of the key findings of the report the committee published, was that while COVAX is important in the roll-out of the vaccine to developing countries, the Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, is also important.<\/p><p>The latter is a platform that has been created to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 vaccines.  It is a voluntary scheme which would allow countries and pharmaceutical companies to develop the vaccine and roll it out.  I firmly believe there should be no profit made on the pandemic.  That was one of the key findings of the committee.  Have people on the ground in our guests' organisations looked at C-TAP in the context of the roll-out of Covid vaccines and the obvious disproportionate impact Covid is having on women across the world?  Another key finding of the committee was to call on the Government to sign up to C-TAP and encourage pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily sign up to it to share those intellectual rights such that all people, particularly those in less developed countries, can access the vaccine.<\/p><p> I again thank our guests for their contributions and for engaging with the committee.  I full support each of the four asks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#D00700","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I propose to take contributions and questions from Deputies and then return to Ms Van Lieshout and the rest of the panel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#E00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank our wonderful guests.  It is never easy to hear gender equality being spoken about at such length and its impact in the context of such a wide array of issues, but it exists and we cannot continue to hide from that existence because we will never have true human rights while gender inequality remains.  I have heard Covid-19 being referred to as a universal leveller.  However, it has not been a universal leveller.  Research has shown that women across the globe have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic compared with men.  One of the fundamental reasons for that is the gender inequalities that existed before Covid ever became a thing.  These gender inequalities are wide ranging.  There is the gender pay gap, the responsibility for family and childcare, the fact that front-line staff in some areas are predominantly female, but also the inadequate supports that were in place.<\/p> <p>  A recent piece of work by the European Institute for Gender Equality was quite startling.  It found that 4.5% of women's employment is at risk across the globe because of the pandemic, compared with 3.8% of men's employment.  Women make up 40% of the global labour force yet account for 54% of job losses to date.  Workers in industries such as retail, hospitality and residential care are predominantly women and those are the areas that have suffered the heaviest job losses to date.  Women make up the bulk of the workforce in those sectors and 40% of all jobs lost by women during the crisis were in these professions.<\/p> <p>  A report published last summer by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company described how women globally have been 1.8 times as likely as men to lose their jobs because of the pandemic.  It reported that societal attitudes have also shaped how women experience the economic fallout, based on their perceived place in society.  Despite the resurgence in employment during the summer months last year, men regained employment at twice the rate that women did, indicating that the economic impact of the pandemic will be felt much longer and harder by women compared with men.<\/p> <p>  When Ireland first went into lockdown last March, the caring responsibility was compounded in many ways by the efforts of some to be more accommodating of women.  For example, as a result of the gender pay gap, women's work often took less of a priority compared with men's work.  Employers were more understanding that women also had caring roles but, as a result of that and the priority that was given to male partners, women actually ended up working considerably longer hours every day just to meet those ever-increasing demands being made of them.  The National Women's Council of Ireland published a really good report on the impact on women's mental health and well-being of carrying the lion's share of the load in terms of work and caring in the home.<\/p> <p>  On the gender-based violence aspect, in three months last year there was a 40% increase in the number of applications for protection and barring orders compared with the same period the previous year.  The figures are stark.  There were 1,300 requests for refuge in domestic violence services that could not be met.   That is eight people per day whose requests for refuge went unanswered.<\/p> <p>  When we look at the future and coming out of Covid - we will come out of Covid at some point - there is no doubt that although women have been the hardest hit by the pandemic, they will also be the backbone of the recovery in their communities, circles and environments.  For that to happen, women's inclusion, representation, rights, social and economic outcomes, equality and protection must be at the core of national and global responses.  Financial stimulus packages and social assistance programmes must be based on greater equality, opportunities and social protection for women.  We must not allow Covid to be used as an excuse to reverse the little progress on gender equality that has been made.  Rather, it should become the catalyst to create something new that focuses on these pre-existing conditions and says \"No more\".  While the eyes of governments nationally and internationally are on these inequalities, there will never be a better time to address them or to implement policies that go to the core of what created the inequalities in the first place.  Covid simply shone a light on the extent of the inequalities that exist, inequalities that were there in my mother's time, my grandmother's time and my great-grandmother's time.  That is what I think needs to happen now.  When we look to the future and policies, we need to look to training, education and employment opportunities for women, the protection of activists and political representation.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of women's health, more than 30,000 women in Ireland alone are currently awaiting a gynaecological appointment.  When that is coupled with the waiting lists for BreastCheck and cervical cancer screening, we are looking at a potential perfect storm in terms of women's health in Ireland.  That is before looking elsewhere in Europe or across the globe where the disproportionate effect of conflict and other gender-based violence will have an even more profound effect.<\/p> <p>  What is needed now more than ever is that not only are women at the table in terms of future development, but that their voices are actually heard at that table.  I agree with our guests that tracking progress is absolutely vital because if it is not in place, plans become words on pages.  Without targets, focus and key performance indicators, gender equality will remain out of reach for future generations because there will not be any meaningful planned progress written down to be achieved.  I am sorry if all that comes across as a bit of a rant.  I fundamentally agree with the vast majority of what the representatives have stated.  In terms of tracking progress on gender equality, what would they like to see achieved in the next 18 months, three years and five years?  What is the best course of action for us to prioritise in the short term and the medium term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#E00300","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I am going to go back to Ms Van Lieshout now before I come back to members.

We really need to see new energy on that to make sure we are tracking what we are doing and not doing.  That applies not only in Ireland but to our programme countries.  Perhaps it is an appropriate proposal to this committee that we pay particular attention to SDG 5, based on this conversation.

Perhaps that should be our way of championing this issue.<\/p> <p>  We have a great international development policy and, at the heart of it, Irish Aid stated it wants to think about what leaving no one behind and reaching the furthest behind first actually means.

It is an excellent policy and, from an IFPA perspective, one of the things we were happy to see was a very strong grounding of human rights and gender equality in that policy, with respect for sexual and reproductive health and rights in a way we had not seen previously in Irish Aid or Ireland's policy.<\/p> <p>  I spoke yesterday to a colleague in Ethiopia who was wholehearted in her respect for the way Irish Aid has integrated policy approaches, good critical analysis and brought sexual and reproductive health and rights into its work on sustainable development as a core aspect.  However, we need to see more.  As Ms Keatinge said, we have not seen the guidance yet and one of the promises of A Better World was a new sexual and reproductive health and rights initiative.  This is something that will give guidance and allow us a framework for accountability and monitoring and for critical engagement with Irish Aid to know how Ireland is pushing forward its strong and respected objectives around gender equality in the context of sexual and reproductive health and rights.

I thank the committee for endorsing the cause of the people's alliance for vaccine equity.  We were delighted to see the committee's recent report and support its calls.<\/p> <p>  The key point to note is that, globally, over 70% of the healthcare workforce are women.  A fact that is quite shocking is those women often face violence in performing their roles and there is a risk that is amplified over access to the finite resources of a Covid-19 vaccine.  The safety and security of those delivering Covid-19 vaccines must also be of utmost priority.  Other health crises have shown that delivery and facilitation of vaccines will depend disproportionately on the unpaid labour of women and girls and this will impact especially on the poorest and those in rural areas.  We know providing equitable access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines in low and middle-income countries will be a catastrophic moral failure if we do not do it.  It will impede progress towards ending this pandemic.  It will compound and deepen the setback to girls' and women's rights, leaving them further behind.  We are part of a network of organisations calling for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.  We strongly endorse the calls this committee has made and will happily provide any further information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for raising the issue of human rights defenders.  It is an important issue in many countries across the globe.  Front Line Defenders highlighted in 2020 that 333 human rights defenders were killed doing their work.  That is a very shocking figure.  These are the people who are often at the coalface of injustice.  They are often the ones who are working with communities, deeply embedded with them, fighting for issues such as gender equality, peace and human rights.  They are experiencing the most brutal forms of retaliation by being killed for the work they do.  I thank the Deputy for highlighting that important issue.<\/p> <p>  These matters arise in the broader context of global restrictions on civil society spaces.  Attacks on human rights defenders are not happening in isolation but are a part of a broader trend whereby states are bringing in increasingly restrictive and oppressive legislation and policy to restrict civil society's work more broadly.  Civicus has classified that in the past couple of years, 111 countries have brought in such restrictive legislation.  According to its categorisation, only 3.4% of the globe live in fully open civil society spaces.  That is a shocking fact to take back and consider in the context of how we see these issues.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has, of course, only made the situation worse because emergency powers have been introduced in a number of countries.  States have, unfortunately, used those emergency powers to restrict further the work of human rights defenders and civil society.  It is also important to highlight that there are gendered aspects to attacks on human rights defenders.  All human rights defenders experience particular attacks, but women experience different types of attacks because of the work that they do with communities and challenging social norms around gender inequality.<\/p><p>As well as the physical threats and killings that they face alongside male human rights defenders, they also face slurs about their name, stigmatisation, discrimination, sexual assault and sexual violence because of the work they do.  It is very important to note that these attacks, much like other levels of gender-based violence, can increase during conflict situations, so it is an important area.<\/p><p> In regard to what Ireland can do, I have been a champion of this around the civil society space and that has been very welcome through the various UN resolutions and initiatives that it has pushed there.  There is an opportunity with the ongoing membership of the UN Security Council because, in the Security Council, we are not seeing civil society systematically included and shaping the policies that have a huge and detrimental impact on their lives.  There is a very important way that Ireland can bring civil society and human rights defenders into the Security Council space.  Major decisions are being made about military responses in countries without consulting those human rights defenders and civil society actors.  One important thing they need to consider when doing that is that they factor in reprisals against human rights defenders who engage with the Security Council, and that they engage fully with UN guidelines on this to make sure human rights defenders do not experience further threats and attacks because of that advocacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Karol Balfe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will hand back to the Chairman for further questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their responses so far.

It has been a very enlightening and provocative session.  I would like to hone in on a few areas.  The global point is that Covid has seriously exacerbated an already existing gender inequality.  I will deal first with women's participation in the workplace.  It is very clear that women are the greatest victims of displacement as the kind of jobs they are in, outside the front-line healthcare area, tend to be less well-paid and there is an in-built discrimination in areas like hospitality, which are the areas that have lost out.  Women have been displaced in employment right across the world, no less here than elsewhere.  It is a huge issue.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on what can be done.  There are two areas, the developing world and areas of conflict, and the more developed world, and the challenge is obviously greater in the former.  What would their comments be about retraining, education and long-term education?  There will be an issue.  One need not be an expert in economics to assume that quite a few of these jobs will not return in the medium term, so we will have a deficit and a spin-off.  Therefore, there is a need for retraining, for re-education and for new opportunities.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment around this, in particular how we might label our overseas development aid and demand that kind of thing in the developing world.  Can we also be in any way prescriptive in our own area?  Overall, women's participation in the workplace is a key issue.<\/p><p>Second, as all in this forum know, education is very important.  The witnesses gave us a very stark figure that 90,000 young female Syrian refugees did not participate in school or education last year.  That is a shocking statistic but I know it is only indicative and that it is repeated elsewhere.  I am inclined to be solutions-focused and we want to be solutions-focused in the way we do our committee work in that we want to make recommendations and ultimately effect change.  There is no difficulty or disagreement between us around the aims, objectives or ambitions and we are <i>ad idem<\/i>on that.  It is a question of how to resolve it.  Do the witnesses have suggestions as to how we could re-focus our overseas aid, make new demands or apply new criteria?  Is there much we can actively do to correct a wrong such as that cited in Jordan, and I know such wrongs are repeated all over the place?  Education is a huge issue.<\/p><p>I want to turn to the issue of domestic violence.  We are all getting anecdotal evidence around domestic violence.  It is a horrendous crime and a wrong that is with us perpetually, but it is clearly exacerbated by the Covid situation, with people being at home together and all that goes with that.  It is a real issue.  Without seeking to be parochial, in my own county, in Cavan town, we need a women's refuge.  The ideal would be that we did not need these things in the first instance but, sadly, we do.  We do not have one there and the nearest women's refuge is in Dundalk, so even in the developed western world, there is a clear need to tackle this question head-on.  When I attend policing committees, as all Oireachtas Members do at a local level, I am constantly getting statistics regarding an increase in domestic violence.  If it is bad here, it is clearly worse in many of the areas the witnesses are dealing with.  I am not sure if the witnesses can be prescriptive in this area as to what we might do.  We must unequivocally condemn this and we must be of one voice on that, needless to say.  However, how can we practically impact on the situation?  We can feel powerless in the face of such a global phenomena.<\/p><p>On another issue, the Chairman will be aware I have been raising this in other forums outside this committee, and it was raised earlier by Deputy Brady, so it has been addressed and I do not wish to labour it.  It is the issue of vaccine equality, which is a huge issue that links to the whole issue of gender inequality and to every other question, in particular the addressing of the Covid variants.  I support the concerns around that and I agree our Government should be out there on that.  As a committee, we have been very clear and prescriptive about that.  As a committee, we need to be very focused on getting some sort of outcomes from our work because there is not much point in having weekly meetings where we are platitudinous if we do not effect some outcomes, although it is a very amorphous kind of area.<\/p><p>It is a great discussion.  It is one of the tragic outcomes of Covid that it has exacerbated and set back progress on gender in quality.  We are witnessing the reversing of progress in health equality, gender equality and educational opportunity.  It is very sad that the entire equality agenda is a victim of Covid, on top of everything else.  Those are my thoughts.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  Well done to our guests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#G00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It is really hard to find accurate data and analyse that data.  We always face this problem when we try to analyse a certain problem or collect evidence.  The existing data shows that women are not participating in the workforce.  Jordan has one of the lowest rates globally in this area.  The unemployment rate for women in Jordan is very high and the employment rate for women is one of the lowest in the region and globally.  It is a complicated problem and we need to come up with comprehensive multidimensional solutions.  Education is part of it.  We need to redirect education to respond to market needs.  We also need to work on raising awareness among families and communities about the need to give more space to women to participate, to get out and to be engaged economically because many women report that they are not allowed to do so by family members, husbands or elderly people in the family.<\/p> <p>  It is also about enforcing laws and legislation that relate to workplace safety and safeguarding in the workplace.  For example, we do not have systems for reporting harassment in the workplace.  We cannot capture the data.  Women do not report it.  There is no system for reporting.  It is a complicated problem and we need to come up with comprehensive solutions.  Education is key.  We all know that it is life-changing and life-saving but we need to direct our education programmes to be responsive to market needs.  Covid gave us a lot of learning opportunities such as using technology and being connected on a national level to training courses and programmes women do not need to attend physically because transport is expensive and sometimes it is not safe to travel from one place to another.  Technology is giving us a lot of opportunity but so far, it has been underutilised.  It can be life-changing for women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Muna Abbas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Regarding the Chairman's question about whether we should be thinking about a specific report to bring some urgency to this issue, it is worth saying in respect of the SDGs that in the past, there has been this idea of a spotlight report.  We know that next year, Ireland must offer its voluntary national review at the high-level political forum.  Is this another opportunity to say \"Let's focus on this issue of gender\"?<\/p> <p>  In response to the question from Deputy Clarke, it is really about what we should prioritise.  As we have seen here, there is no magic bullet nor is there any quick fix.  We know it is complicated and that a range of responses are needed.  If I dare attempt to think about how to prioritise over the next 18 months, a few things that have already been touched on come to mind.  First, we are in this Covid environment and the vaccine issue must be brought to the fore.  The phrase \"We're in the same storm but different boats\" is really important.  We know that unless we are all safe, nobody is safe.  As has already been said, the issue of vaccines is so important and we have to get it right now.<\/p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that in terms of Irish Aid and what Ireland is doing on the UN Security Council, it is championing the right things.  It does have these very good policies in place.  We also know that Frances Fitzgerald, MEP, is doing a great job at EU level around the gender action programme and really promoting those issues at EU level.  The problem is not lack of policies; it is lack of implementation.  This is what we really need to focus on.  It involves tracking and questioning of where the progress is and what the measurements are over time periods.  Let us not forget that with these policies, we also need to recommit to funding.  This involves funding of overseas development aid and funding around specific gender programmes if we are to implement these policies.<\/p> <p>  My third priority is collaboration on so many different levels.  In 2018 - perhaps some members of this committee were there - Ireland led an international caucus of female parliamentarians.  That was an amazing experience where we saw that learning from Ireland, America and Europe, but also from Africa.  It was so rich and important and will surely help us speed up some of these processes.  We have seen today that collaboration between NGOs, members of this committee and politicians.<\/p> <p>  The final issue I would prioritise is the need for us to keep collaborating in order to keep the conversation very live in the public space among the Irish population and globally through interactions like this one.  It involves really engaging at constituency level and getting engaged with the national conversation around gender equality.  These are four things I would prioritise.  I am sure there are more.  I will hand over to other colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Ms Taylor and Ms Winstanley will join us to speak about the questions on gender-based violence and GM.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>In response to the question from Senator Joe O'Reilly and the comments from the Chairman about FGM, the Irish Family Planning Association runs an FGM treatment clinic funded by the HSE for women in Ireland who have experienced FGM.  When we look at the issues of girls in education, women in the workforce and issues like FGM and child marriage, I am prompted to think about some of the titles of United Nations Population Fund reports in recent years that have focused on girls at ten years of age and adolescent pregnancy.  In focusing on how we get women to the table, we must look back at the lives of girls and how we ensure girls can stay in education, are safe from gender-based violence and are not grappling with unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections such as HIV when they are adolescents but are able to plan their lives and futures.  One of the core issues is access to reproductive health services and information and sexuality education.  In 2019, we held a civil society dialogue in advance of the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development..<\/p><p>At a time when we used to be able to pack rooms with people and have them thronging around tables - it seems like a very long time ago now - at every single table there were individuals working on development issues and thematic issues relating to the LGBT community.  Those people included youth and health workers, and policy influencers.  At one point, everyone in the room was talking about sexuality education.  They were discussing issues such as their experience of poor sexuality education in Ireland as young people, their frustration about their children not having access to quality education in schools now or their understanding of the ways in which denial of sexuality education globally impacts on a girls' capacity to flourish.  Focusing in on those issues relating to girls and adolescents and how we build forward better and get women to the table is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>In addressing the issue relating to Colombia, I will provide some statistics in order that the committee can understand how prevalent conflict-related sexual violence was.  The constitutional court in Colombia said that it was a systematic practice.  Oxfam undertook two studies which show that between 2000 and 2009 there were 149 cases per day of sexual violence in armed conflict.  When it then did a follow-up study in 2010 to 2015, it found that there were 400 cases of sexual violence against women in conflicts each day.  What is worth noting here is that the second study showed that the increase occurred during peace talks.  We know definitely that sexual violence in conflict and domestic violence is a continuum between this kind of violence.  They are inextricably linked because of the kind of male attitudes which perpetrate this violence.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that the women particularly addressed during the peace talks and which they put firmly on the agenda was that there was a need in the transitional justice system to ensure that there were no amnesties for conflict-related sexual violence.  This is the first peace accord in the world which stated that there should be no amnesties.  One of the difficulties now is to completely ensure that there are no amnesties for conflict-related sexual violence.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that women are asking for in particular - this is really key at this moment because if the committee is going to visit Colombia, it is one of the asks that I would have - is that there be a discussion of the fact that there needs to be a national case in the transitional justice system on conflict-related sexual violence.  This would be essential if we are to really see that there are no amnesties and that the issue of sexual violence is taken very seriously.  If this does not happen, it is going to be very difficult to change male attitudes on violence towards women.  This is a key ask that I would like to put on the committee&rsquo;s agenda when it visits Colombia.

Do any members wish to make further contributions at this stage?<\/p> <p>  Before returning to Ms Van Lieshout for closing comments, I want to acknowledge the work of D&oacute;chas and the importance of Irish Aid and its team in ensuring that its priorities are kept very much to the fore.  I also acknowledge the work that Ireland continues to do with the UN, notwithstanding our membership of the Security Council, but also in its hosting of recent meetings on the matter of girls' education and acknowledging the fact that during the pandemic alone, almost 20 million girls have been denied schooling and have left education.  There continue to be an enormous number, some 130 million girls, out of school worldwide, and I stress the importance of education.  I thank Ms Abbas for her focus, particularly on Jordan and Lebanon, having regard to the refugee situation there and the need to ensure that education standards are kept up.  She spoke about online education and courses and ensuring that they are of a certain standard that will allow for a situation where school accreditations are given and that education can be resumed at some stage in the future.<\/p> <p>  Unless our witnesses would like to come back in to comment further on any of those points, I will ask Ms Van Lieshout to proceed to her closing comments.  If any of her guests would like to prioritise issues for our committee after this meeting, we will obviously be in contact with our Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  We have been working, as Deputy Brady said, on the whole area of Covid-19 vaccine equity but our witnesses have raised a number of important issues this morning that we would be keen to continue to highlight across the wider civil society here in Ireland and to also ensure that the Government keeps these issues high on its agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021032300002#J00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and all of the committee members for this very rich and important discussion.

In some very brief closing remarks, I want to thank the committee for giving us this chance to share with it some of these stories.  We are all very much on the same page in that we cannot afford to allow Covid-19 to get in the way of the urgent issue of gender equality.  As has been stated, Covid-19 has exacerbated and accelerated the trends.  There is a real urgency around this issue.<\/p> <p>  I also thank the D&oacute;chas members for sharing some of their stories and these very stark facts.  As Ms Taylor said, there have been 13 million more child marriages as a result of Covid-19 over a 12-month period, which is just extraordinary.  Ms Abbas said that there is an entire generation at risk in Jordan and in the Middle East in general because of a lack of education.  We know that many of those girls will not go back to education at all.  That potential of those women and girls is lost for an entire generation.<\/p> <p>  We also heard from Christian Aid about the impact of conflict.  I am aware that the committee had a session on Syria where the issue of gender-based violence and the use of women as weapons of war was very starkly put forward during those sessions.<\/p> <p>  We also heard that we cannot afford the luxury of being overwhelmed by this.  As Deputy Clarke said so well, we know that women are going to be the backbone of the recovery.  For that to happen, they need to be at the table and to be those leaders we have seen in our own communities.  We need to find the way and the space to bring them to the table and to hear their voices.<\/p> <p>  I will make one positive comment about the pandemic in that it has allowed the committee to be here this morning to hear different voices from the field and from the wide range of D&oacute;chas's NGOs, which I really appreciate.  Let us hope that we can keep doing that more.  The solution is going to come from these conversations by bringing different people together.  We can see that with that stronger collaboration, I genuinely believe that we can go faster and make that difference.<\/p> <p>  The outcome that I needed from the session today was to hear from the committee members that they will be our champions on gender equality, on the SDGs and on the importance of ODA and Irish Aid's work.<\/p><p>I hope the committee members will go away with some practical takeaways.  We are very open to exploring more and I reiterate the idea concerning the SDGs and the Spotlight report, and there being some more practical and specific things we can work on together.  We are happy to carry on that conversation.  I also refer to the informal session we had with the committee last week.  We ran out of time then, but I hope the members will agree that one of the key things we put on the table and one of the key policy asks of D&oacute;chas members was gender.  There were many more concerns, however, so I hope we will get the chance to work with the committee members in that regard.  <\/p><p> More importantly, I hope today the members got a sense of the important role that Irish NGOs are playing, as well as the important role of the diversity of the D&oacute;chas membership.  My team and I are here and available if the committee members have questions and if there are issues that they want to tackle more and bring such a conversation together.

It is clear from the contributions this morning, our engagement and the international reporting community that the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on women and girls is a matter of deep concern.  It is most worrying, whether those impacts are in the areas of health, education and-or food security and nutrition or in the context of gender-based violence.  The impact of Covid-19, while not yet fully assessed, is most stark, and that is why this committee felt our engagement this morning was so important.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt that this is an issue that the members of this committee will be returning to, and I note the interest of Deputy Clarke and others.

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss in general the topic of banking matters with the representatives.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings a witness physically present would.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms McDonagh to make her opening remarks.

Hopefully, everyone can hear me loud and clear.  I am pleased to be joined today by my colleague, Mr. Gavin Kelly, CEO of our retail Ireland business.  I very much hope we can be of assistance to the committee today.  I am conscious that we bring a particular perspective to today's session being the only majority privately owned Irish retail bank.  We circulated a longer opening statement in advance.  I will, therefore, address the key points in that statement in my opening comments.<\/p> <p>  Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of the introduction of broad restrictions on the Irish economy arising from Covid-19.  As a leading lender to the Irish economy, we felt a strong sense of duty to respond quickly to support our customers and the wider economy.<\/p> <p>  At the outset of the pandemic, we moved at speed to proactively introduce a range of supports for our customers.  For example, Bank of Ireland put in place more than 100,000 payment breaks across the group, and of these, 97% of customers have returned to pre-Covid-19 terms with only a small number requiring further support.<\/p> <p>  Like any business, Covid-19 has presented challenges for Bank of Ireland.  I want to take a moment to outline our 2020 financial results.  We believe this context is very relevant to our discussion today.  Ensuring our business model is appropriately profitable and sustainable is absolutely critical if we are to attract and retain investors, generate capital that can be lent into the Irish economy and reinvest in the business to ensure our long-term competitiveness and viability.<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is unique among Irish banks in being the only institution to have fully repaid the Irish taxpayer, which we did in 2013.  This support from the taxpayer was vitally important during the financial crisis and was gratefully received.  It should never have been needed, however.  That is why Bank of Ireland made it an absolute priority to repay the Irish taxpayer as quickly as possible.  To date, Bank of Ireland has returned &euro;6 billion to the State, delivering a &euro;1.2 billion net cash return to taxpayers.  Over the past three years, &euro;40 million in dividends have also been paid by Bank of Ireland to the State.<\/p> <p>  The State&rsquo;s continued 14% shareholding in the group, which is held at the discretion of the shareholder, as is the case with any investor, will represent an additional return to the Irish taxpayer whenever it is sold.  The same is true for any future dividends paid out to shareholders.  I mention this by way of illustration of the unique nature of our position in the Irish retail banking market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our most recent financial results, 2020 was a challenging year, with Bank of Ireland announcing a &euro;374 million underlying loss before tax.  The bank, however, saw a stronger performance in the second half of the year and a return to profitability.<\/p> <p>  When we presented our annual results on 1 March, we also announced a range of significant changes to our branch network and to the provision of local banking services to our customers.  In addition to the reduction in our branch network, we announced a new partnership with An Post to be launched in the coming months and in advance of any branch closures.  This will enable all our customers to access banking services at more than 900 post office locations across Ireland in addition to our branch network.<\/p> <p>  This is the first significant change to the bank&rsquo;s physical footprint in almost a decade whereas other banks have significantly reduced the size of their branch network in the preceding years.  This change reflects the reality that we have reached an inescapable tipping point in customer preference between online and offline banking.  We are, however, fully aware that changes like this can be of concern to some customers, especially those living or working in rural communities.  Bank of Ireland will, therefore, continue to invest in a strong nationwide presence of 169 branches and, of course, we will also continue to offer mobile and telephone banking for all our customers.<\/p> <p>  Many changes are confronting the banking industry.  As a country, we all need a profitable and sustainable banking sector to support ongoing growth and lending, especially as the economy recovers post Covid.  A once in a lifetime process of change is under way in banking right now, not just in Ireland but across Europe, and indeed, the global banking sector.<\/p> <p>  The decision of NatWest to withdraw from the Irish market reflects the realities of a challenged sector and has thrust the dynamics of Ireland&rsquo;s banking sector further into the spotlight.  Our belief is that the continued attraction of private capital into the sector and the economy is the critical path to ensuring a sustainable, robust and more normalised retail banking sector.<\/p> <p>  In closing, the history of Irish banking, and the role banks had in Ireland's financial crisis of the past, is understood.  The economic impact of the pandemic today on Irish businesses and households is recognised.  We have been proactive in our support for customers during Covid-19.  The focus of my team and me, however, is equally on the future of Ireland's economy, banking sector and the role Bank of Ireland can play over the next decade in Ireland's development.  We are looking at am imminent period of recovery and growth.  To enable the financial well-being of Irish households and businesses, an improved relationship between our sector and the State is overdue.  As a leading lender to the Irish economy, Bank of Ireland wants to play a central role in this discussion about our collective future.  I will be happy to now respond to any of the committee's comments or questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>For the information of members, Deputies Doherty and Barry, Senator Higgins and Deputy Richmond will speak.

It concerns the appalling decision to close down one third of the branch network right across the State.  I want to put on the record again that the Bank of Ireland exists today because of the taxpayers of this State, who bailed it out at a time when it collapsed because of the reckless behaviours of bankers before Ms McDonagh's time.  It exists today because of that sacrifice the Irish people made and now, in the time of a pandemic as we have just discussed, the response from Bank of Ireland is to withdraw those services in the communities.<\/p> <p>  Ms McDonagh will be aware that the Financial Conduct Authority in Britain has asked banks not to close branches during the pandemic for a most important reason, namely, because those who might want to move to digital access may not be in a position to get that support in-branch because they are cocooning.  However, the Bank of Ireland group has decided to ignore that.  It is closing 15 branches in the North and 88 branches in the South.  There are vulnerable people who are cocooning and who will not be able to leave their houses to go to the branch to get help to go online.  My view is that the group used Covid as a dummy run for this process, when during the first wave a similar number of branches were closed under the guise of the pandemic.  In recent weeks, the bank has announced that basically, the same number of branches and most of the same branches will be closed.  Is there anything that the Minister for Finance, as the major shareholder in the Bank, could say to encourage the group to at least delay this until after the pandemic is over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#C01000","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>The way the Deputy has described our decision is not how I would entirely characterise our approach.  I will respond factually.  First, as I said in my opening statement, we were very grateful for the support of the taxpayers, which we have repaid more than in full, over eight years ago.  However, I appreciate and recognise the history of banking.  On our current and future practices, we need to respond to the changes in our customers' preferences.  The Deputy will understand that that is how a well-run business should act.<\/p> <p>  We have announced the closure of 88 branches in the Republic of Ireland and 15 in Northern Ireland.  None will be closed until September.  In parallel with that announcement, we have announced a partnership with An Post.  We already have a partnership with the Post Office in Northern Ireland.  That will provide all of our customers with access to their 900 outlets.  The reason we are doing this is because there has been a seismic shift in customer behaviour to which we must respond.  Yes, it is one third of our branch network but I can assure the Deputy that it is not one third of our footfall.  If anything, those branches have been rarely visited.  Three out of four customers of those branches have not set foot in them within the past year.  Maybe that is partly because of the pandemic but if one looks at the two years preceding the pandemic, one sees the overall footfall in branches across our network reduced by 25%.  At the same time, we have seen a significant take-up in mobile usage.  As the Deputy will be aware, we launched a new mobile app in 2020 with a 50% increase in functionality.  Since we launched it, we have had an increase of over 26% in take-up.  Therefore, there has been a shift in how our customers want to engage in banking.  It has been expedited by the pandemic but it is a process that has been ongoing for probably the last decade.  We have responded to customer preference in our decision to close branches.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister for Finance is obviously a key stakeholder in the bank.  The State owns a 14% minority shareholding.  The Minister has said on public record that it is not his responsibility to influence or impact commercial decisions that are taken by the bank.  We have taken those commercial decisions in reflection of customer behaviour.

Obviously, there is a precedent for this in the public domain in the form of our competitor's acquisition of Goodbody.

Obviously, I am here to talk about Bank of Ireland, but that is in the public domain.  I will keep this quite generic because it is just not appropriate for me to talk about a third party whose process has not started.  If Bank of Ireland were to acquire an entity in which bonuses and variable remuneration are paid in a normalised way, as in the case of every other non-Irish bank and corporate entity in Ireland, and it is only Irish banks that have this restriction, then I would certainly look at opportunities to normalise pay.  Even if there is no acquisition, in our annual report - and I appreciate the Deputy has a response to this - there was a letter from our group chairman that referred to the need to revisit normalisation of remuneration.  We have repaid the taxpayer in full.  Irish banks are severely restricted and treated uncompetitively compared with our normal Irish peers, with whom we compete for talent and customers here in Ireland, and with other banks in Europe and the UK and other Irish entities, with which we compete for digital, finance and customer service skills.  I appreciate, given where the economy is now, that to talk about bankers' bonuses is highly contentious.  If, however, I just step back and think about the future and the recovery of this economy, having Irish-only banks restricted in a way in which other banks in Ireland are not is anti-competitive and makes it very difficult for us to retain and attract key talent, which we need for a profitable and sustainable Irish banking sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I have limited time and I just want to be clear on what is being said.

Very few people in the sector would earn in excess of the &euro;500,000 cap.  It is about the variable pay.  Variable pay is a way of aligning colleagues' performance with shareholder interests.  Those outcomes are related not just to profit but also to whether or not staff are achieving customer satisfaction targets and whether or not they are doing the right thing as far as risk management is concerned.  Varying people's pay based on performance can be a very good thing if applied appropriately.  There are new European Banking Authority regulations that are very clear.  We are one of, I think, very few banks in the European Union that still face restrictions.  The Deputy's summary is right, however.

In Ms McDonagh's responses she talked about the money the Irish public contributed in the bank bailout being repaid.  It is really important to be clear that while the money may have been repaid, the cost of the impact of austerity, the impact on people's lives - young lives - and five or ten years of missed opportunities and lost services has not been repaid.  I will be frank.  I am quite shocked to see there is a push for \"normalisation\", as it is being framed.  It is not normal that we would have such a huge level of pay into the financial sector through the effective removal of the pay cap and the reintroduction of excessive pay incentives.  The message I hear today is that we need to tighten our action and legislation on this in order that we do not see loopholes being exploited because clearly they will be.<\/p> <p>  The issue I really want to focus on, however, is the branch closures that have been announced.  Ms McDonagh has framed this as a response to the digital demand, but we need to be clear.  We know from EU statistics from just last year that 47% of the Irish public lack basic digital skills.  That is the statistic from an EU analysis.  Ireland is not a place where every single person has a smartphone in his or her hand.  That is a bit of a myth.  In that regard I am very concerned about the branch closures.  What consultation will Bank of Ireland have with local communities on the branches?  I think over 100 branches across the island might be closed.  What social impact assessment or environmental impact assessment has been done of the longer distances and the longer wait times to access services?  What engagement is there with local authorities on landmark buildings?  Many Bank of Ireland branches are anchor or landmark buildings in towns across Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As for the post office proposal, is it Ms McDonagh's understanding that there will be a reversal of the planned 200 post office closures in respect of this deal?  When she talks about the 900 post offices, does she anticipate that this partnership will in fact reverse post office closures in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The engagement with trade unions has been very disappointing from their perspective.  What measures are in place to engage with trade unions?  Is it the case that at the moment permanent staff who take voluntary redundancy are being replaced with temporary staff?  Those questions relate to the branch closures.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, has the bank sold ATMs in the past year?  Can Ms McDonagh confirm the bank's plans in respect of its network of ATMs across Ireland?  That is a part of that service also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#D01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>There were a few questions there.

Today, 70% of our entire customer base is digitally active.  We have seen satisfaction in our digital channels increase by 25 points in the past year.

The Senator referred to comments made by the Irish Postmasters' Union on the potential closure of post offices.  The issue has not come up in our engagement with the post office to date.  We believe the contract we are signing with the post office goes to ensuring the viability of post offices into the future by bringing another service to postmasters.  That is where we see the benefit for them.  From our perspective, it makes sure we bridge the digital divide so that customers who want to avail of lodgements and withdrawals can do so in the network of post offices around the country.  We believe the 900 post offices currently operating give ample coverage, particularly in the locations where we are closing.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on properties, the Senator is correct.  We have a number of landmark buildings around the country.  A substantial number of the 88 properties are landmark buildings and many of them are large, for example, some of them have living quarters upstairs where the branch manager used to live.  The Senator will be familiar with that.  There is quite a bit of space in these properties that could be availed of for community use in the future.  We have received a lot of expressions of interest from various community groups, credit unions and local businesses seeking to set up remote working hubs in their towns, right up to Departments and county councils.  We are open to engaging on these buildings.  We have already had extensive discussions and these will continue over the next six months.  We are not closing any of these properties, which will remain as bank branches for the next six months.  Post September, we will make sure the buildings are maintained until we have reached agreement with prospective buyers on the best use of the properties going forward.  In four of the 88 locations we will retain an ATM and maintain the buildings because there is no alternative ATM in the towns in question.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's final question on ATMs, just before Christmas we sold 700 ATMs to a company called Euronet.  These were all ATMs that were based in stores and shops.  Euronet is a professional services ATM company and ATMs are its only business.

This meeting is a welcome opportunity.  I will try to avoid repeating questions that have already been asked.  I will begin by following up on a set of questions Deputy Doherty asked concerning mortgages for people with underlying conditions.  I have a concern because it has been reported and, indeed, denied by the Bank of Ireland and other banks that applicants for mortgages have been either refused a mortgage or have been unable to draw down their mortgages because their employers are participating in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  I appreciate that the claim has been denied by Bank of Ireland and that these matters are correctly dealt with on a case-by-case basis, an approach the Minister for Finance has encouraged.  How many mortgages have been approved by Bank of Ireland in the past 12 months and how many of those have been drawn down?  How do those figures compare with the previous 12 months, taking Covid into consideration?  Given that mortgage brokers have stated this is happening and the banks are denying it, what is the truth of the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E01000","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>We have increased our share of the mortgage market.  We have done that by being competitive in terms of our servicing.  We have not changed our pricing structure.  I know we can have a discussion about mortgage prices in Ireland but we have not reduced or changed our pricing.  We have increased our market share because we have worked with brokers and improved our turnaround times.  We now have over 50% of first-time buyers who get end-to-end approval and drawdown on their mortgage digitally.  Those sorts of service initiatives are central to our business model.<\/p> <p>  In terms of excluding customers for any particular reason, we look at customers on a case-by-case basis.  It is not in the interests of anyone, either the customer, the bank, the State or the economy, to have banks provide mortgages that are not sustainable for individuals who then find themselves in financial distress.  We want to make sure that a mortgage is sustainable for the life term of the mortgage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of total lending, we lent a total of &euro;5.3 billion in retail Ireland in 2020.  That covers mortgages and SME and personal lending.  Of that, &euro;2.1 billion was in Irish mortgages and those are part of our 2020 annual report.

I will move to a wider question which she touched on in her opening remarks and in the notes she presented.  The future of the Irish banking sector has been an underlying theme not just in this engagement but in all our engagements.  We have gone through a tumultuous number of weeks in which a long-standing service provider announced it is to leave the market.  The system of banking is changing rapidly.  The closure of branches, regardless of whether we like or whether it is modernisation or something else, is devastating for many communities.  We have also heard rumours that there are other concerns for other institutions.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the issue I am about to raise is one for the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on it to the Minister and I have tried to ask the Central Bank the same question a number of times.  What is the future of the Irish banking sector?  Why are banks not coming into this market?  What is so unattractive about the Irish market?  How do we provide more options for customers?  I know Ms McDonagh does not necessarily want to hear about competition but people on the street want to know where they can get cheaper mortgages, cheaper lending and perhaps a different type of service.  What is the future of the sector?  What opportunities and challenges does Brexit present to the entire banking and financial services sector?<\/p><p>I appreciate Ms McDonagh has two minutes to answer two big questions, but perhaps she could give a minute or two of insight on where she sees her bank going in those areas in the future and what ordinary people like me and many other committee members who happen to be customers of Bank of Ireland can expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#E01200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I realise I am not going to do that very good question justice, but I certainly would want to be part of an ongoing discussion about the future of Irish banking, as I said in my opening statement.  I will outline what I see as the three challenges facing the European banking sector which are not unique to Ireland and I will outline a couple that are more unique to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  First, there is a need for digital investment across all banks in Europe and the UK because of customer preference.  That requires investment and the cost to digitise and modernise banks and to remain competitive against new entrants into the banking market.  The second is a lower for longer interest rate environment and in the European case negative interest rate environment.  Traditionally, banks have made revenue from holding excess deposits or at least having a cost for holding deposits.  That has now changed and it is an expense for a bank to hold deposits.  Some of those we pass on to larger deposit customers, and we can talk about that, but that is a reality that has significantly reduced revenue streams for all European banks.  The third, and perhaps this is not common across all of Europe but it is for some markets, is muted credit formation.  Part of that is uncertainty about Brexit and part of it is Covid-related.  Some of it will be dissipated, hopefully, by economic recovery and Brexit in the rear view mirror, but there has been muted credit formation, particularly in Ireland.  Banks are losing money on deposits and they are not necessarily growing their lending books.<\/p> <p>  Two features are specific to Irish banking.  One is size.  There are two big banks, although in a relatively small market.  Retail requires scale and economies of scale.  That is why one may see that smaller banks in a small market are not able to achieve minimum profitability hurdles and they may divest.  We have seen that over the years.<\/p> <p>  The last point I wish to make, which is quite topical, is the relatively high-risk ratings attached to Irish lending because of the last global financial crisis.  That means more capital must be held for every euro that is loaned, for example, for an Irish mortgage.  That results in a higher level of pricing in mortgages.  Irish banking may have relatively high mortgage pricing but that does not necessarily mean it is profitable.<\/p> <p>  As a result of all of the above, the Irish banking sector is challenged in achieving the type of returns that shareholders expect over a period of time.  Our response to that is to innovate and digitise, which we are doing, be more cost-efficient, and we have done that, and grow.  Up to the Covid pandemic we were growing our lending book and I very much hope to support the growth and recovery of the Irish market.  There is also diversification of income, such as growing our wealth and insurance business, and increasing the profitability of our UK subsidiary.  Those are the challenges we face.  I would be happy to continue the discussion with the benefit of more time at the Deputy's convenience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh and Mr. Kelly for attending and for their submission to the committee.  I have three questions about bank closures, staff and the relationship with An Post.  In my constituency of Wicklow, Bank of Ireland has decided to close three branches in Carnew, Tinahely and Rathdrum.  They are three vibrant and strong communities in south Wicklow.  Many rural towns and villages have been given a new lease of life with working from home, and many companies are saying that people can work from home permanently.  It brings an added vibrancy to those towns and villages, and brings greater footfall.<\/p> <p>  However, the bank's decision in that area is a blow to that part of Wicklow.  Customers and businesses there have an intergenerational relationship with those bank branches.  Businesses have had a relationship with the bank for three or four generations.  The cluster of banks Bank of Ireland is going to remove from that area will deprive the area of a basic necessity for a community, which is a bank branch in the locality.  It is at a time when those areas need that flexibility, support and the continued relationship they have built up with the bank over generations.  Flexibility and support are needed by many local businesses and communities as we emerge from Covid.  They are under tremendous pressure.<\/p> <p>  I understand the pressures Bank of Ireland is under with online banking.  The bank drove that as well, because it asked people to go online and it provided that facility.  I understand the pressures of that, but Bank of Ireland has removed branches from areas that do not have a very good broadband connection, particularly in rural parts of south Wicklow.  That is a problem.  The bank is expecting people to use online banking, but they are in areas that do not have good broadband at present.<\/p> <p>  Will Bank of Ireland reassess the closure of some rural branches based on the positive impact, if there can be a positive impact, that Covid might have on those rural towns and communities and the Government's policy on towns first and the drive towards the regeneration and revitalisation of rural towns and villages?  It could even be for a reduced number of hours.  Could the bank look at all those rural branches and especially that cluster in Wicklow?  The bank has created a void in Wicklow where people have no bank branch at all.  National broadband is being rolled out over the next two to three years.  Would the bank consider holding back on closing some of those branches until that banking catchment has high-quality access to broadband, to bridge the digital divide that exists whereby people do not have access to broadband?<\/p> <p>  The third issue is the staff.  Does the bank provide an opportunity to staff in those branches to upskill to other areas within the bank, such as the back-office systems, IT operations or other developing areas of banking as the banking model changes?  Is that the first option the bank would offer to those staff?<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to An Post.  We have all received communications from the postmasters.  Bank of Ireland suggests there is an offering in that regard, whereby An Post could provide that offering for transactions.  Will the bank be directly involved in those negotiations with An Post?  Many of the postmasters tell us that the return they get from offering those services is inadequate.  We are seeing bank branches closing down and unless the postmasters get a return for providing that service, we will see rural post offices close down as well.  If An Post is to provide those services, it must be adequately resourced and paid for doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#F00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Deputy's first questions as to whether we would reassess and our views on the challenges of national broadband coverage.  I will ask Mr. Kelly to talk about the specifics of Wicklow, how we are supporting colleagues in the branches that are due to close, whether in Wicklow or more broadly, and the An Post discussion.<\/p> <p>  We will not reassess closures.  I will explain why.  We have not taken this decision lightly.  We have looked at the behaviours and preferences of our customers over a long period of time, even before the Covid pandemic.  I will give the Deputy a perspective on all the customers in the 88 branches that will be closed.  Three out of four of them have not set foot in the branch in the last 12 months.  There has been a seismic reduction in volumes since even before Covid.  We are not in the business of closing busy branches.  We are responding to a shift in customer behaviour.  I know it is disappointing for communities, but it is not a surprise that people are shifting to online consumption, whether that is of entertainment, groceries or how we buy many things, including banking.  Obviously, there is an element in local villages and towns of a re-emergence, with people working from home, and nearly 80% of our colleagues are working from home, of people who will shop local or go local.  However, we are seeing, particularly as the country reopens, that people are keen to get back into pubs, restaurants, cinemas and local gyms, but they are not necessarily looking forward to going back to bank branches.  They have already migrated to a more digital experience.  It is a little like the fact that once one discovers Netflix, one will not necessarily go back to DVDs.  We see that shift as permanent and established.  We have not come to this decision lightly.  We have looked at a great deal of analysis and at footfall trends over a number of years.<\/p><p>That is how we got to this decision, which I appreciate is a difficult one.  We think it is a reflection of customer demand.<\/p><p> On national broadband, I appreciate that there may be challenges.  After the closures, our network will contain 169 branches, 103 of which are located outside the main urban city centres.  It is not the case that branches will only be seen in urban areas and not in rural Ireland.  We will maintain a presence across the country and if an individual has poor broadband, we still have 169 branches, access to 900 An Post outlets and a contact centre that operates 24-7, 365 days a year.  There are alternatives for people who are not able or do not wish to engage with us digitally, but we are seeing that the vast majority of all ages are.  I revert to Mr. Kelly to talk more about Wicklow specifically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>On the branches in Wicklow, I have spent time in all three locations that are affected.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from in terms of the impact on communities.  The deal with An Post is key for us because we have seen usage in all three locations drop over the last number of years.  There are 23 post offices and five remaining Bank of Ireland branches in County Wicklow.  Carnew, Rathdrum and Tinahely are closer to locations in Wexford as well, so we have ensured good coverage so customers have access to a branch and to a post office.  In the three locations in question, the distance between some of the post offices and the three branches is less than 100 yds.  That is an important factor in our decision but we will work with the groups involved.  The other thing that is important is that while the branch might be closing, our support for the community will not change in terms of business advisers and youth advisers doing education in schools, for example.  All those supports will continue in Wicklow and in all others all counties as they are today for the next number of years.<\/p> <p>  I cannot comment on the relationship directly between An Post and the postmasters but I will give a view.  I am involved in the negotiations on the contract with An Post.  As a number of these services are added together, they get a scale effect for the postmasters.  We are contributing to that but the committee would have to talk to the post office about the contract they have directly with postmasters.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious of the impact on staff.  As Ms McDonagh said, there will be no compulsory redundancies for staff.  We have invested significantly in upskilling staff over the last year.  A number of staff have been helping and supporting our contact centres, which can now be supported from working from home, or they can reallocate to other branches.  Staff have that choice and we are working through it with them ahead of the change in September.  Staff will be protected during this change.  If they want voluntary redundancy, we have that available since last year and will support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I will follow up the questions relating to An Post, specifically in respect of the level of engagement and analysis done in terms of post offices.

In my constituency, Galway West, the Oughterard branch is the last one in the village and it is set to close.  I have spoken to a number of businesses that have raised serious concerns.  They feel that the An Post branch is far too small and already far too busy to deal with their custom as well.  Ms McDonagh mentioned that there been a drop in footfall but, in the context of that branch, businesses have told me that it lost some of its services previously and that they were brought back because of the level of demand in the area.<\/p> <p>  On ATMs, Mr. Kelly mentioned that if there is no other ATM in the village, then the existing ATM will stay.  On the Euronet sale that Bank of Ireland completed, I was contacted by a number of constituents who received letters stating that if they had their ATM-only cards, they would only be able to use the ATMs in the branch.

We did that and, as a result, complaints about branch service have gone down by nearly 80% since 2018.  We are dynamic in how we adapt our services.  I cannot talk about the branch in Oughterard, but branch ATM and cheque usage has declined 50% since 2018.  Even since we made those changes, we have seen customer behaviour change.

The services we are looking at in post offices will be cheque lodgement and cash withdrawal, with some access to coin services.

We are contacting any customers who still have those cards and they will be upgraded to debit cards, which will allow full access to facilities at ATMs, as the Deputy referred to, operated by Euronet.  Part of the reason for giving six months' notice is so we can have one-to-one consultations with customers over the course of the next number of months to ensure that everybody's service continues as they wish, notwithstanding the changes we have talked about.

In the UK, we are required to, as are all companies.  In Ireland, we voluntarily provided that information and disclosed it as part of our 1 March results.  The gender pay gap currently stands at 23.8%, which is a slight improvement year on year.  It does not mean men get paid more for doing the same jobs as women but the average male colleague will be paid 23.8% more than the average female colleague because there are fewer senior women.

I am not looking to change our physical footprint on a regular basis.  This is a very big decision.  It is the first major change that we have made to Bank of Ireland's network in a decade but for me to sit here as a retail bank CEO and guarantee no changes forevermore is not possible or realistic.  It would not be authentic of me to make that sort of statement.

I thank Ms McDonagh for the presentation so far.  The line that hops off it for me is the one which states: &quot;We stand alone as the only majority privately owned Irish retail bank.&quot;  That is the elephant in the room here.  It shows the continuing disaster, which is the Irish banking market, that we are so amiss with competition within this particular sector.  Mario Draghi said that the Irish banking market is a quasi-monopoly.  He is not far wrong on that.  That quasi-monopoly status allows Bank of Ireland to operate in the manner that it does because customers have no option in many ways but to do business with Bank of Ireland in the manner they do.<\/p><p>Ms McDonagh mentioned the transition of people from physical banking to online banking but I would posit that Bank of Ireland has actively sought to push people out of bank branches in the past number of years.  Seven or ten years ago there would have been ten spaces for people to work with tellers.  That was very quickly reduced to one and people were left 20 deep in queues trying to get near the teller and so on.  There was an active project to reduce customers coming into banks in the past number of years and that has, in part, led to the transition to online banking.<\/p><p>The cuts in the number of bank branches in the country are savage and they will have a savage effect on Irish society.  It is deeply disappointing given the quasi-monopoly position Bank of Ireland has within the particular sector.  My first question is on the differential in the mortgage interest rate in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>that in other European countries.  Ms McDonagh mentioned capital requirements and the risk effect in part accounting for that differential.  What proportion of differential is accounted for through capital requirements and the risk effect?  Does Bank of Ireland's quasi-monopoly status also add to that differential?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#H01100","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>With respect, I recognise the Deputy's perspective.  He talked about the manner in which we do business.  The manner in which we do business is that we are the largest lender to the Irish economy.  We have been for the past ten years.  We have a 1.7 million customer base.  We are the largest lender, with more than 50% of the market share, to Irish small and medium enterprise, SMEs.  Last year, we had a 30% reduction in complaints about, for example, current accounts, which is the manner in which many customers will engage with us.  We were seeing the highest level on the net promoter score, which is an industry way of measuring satisfaction.  We have also fundamentally changed the culture of our colleagues, going from a very low level to leading global financial services benchmarks in terms of our colleagues' engagement and the cultural embedding.  The manner in which we run our bank is as a competitive entity and we take great pride in how we support our customers, colleagues and communities.<\/p> <p>  In response to the mortgage pricing, we often see comparisons with other banks in Europe that would offer, say, a 1% mortgage.  The Deputy will see that our rates would vary.  They are fixed rates.  In terms of the latest on our pricing, we would see a green mortgage, for example, being approximately 2.6%; Mr. Kelly can confirm that.  I would make a few comparisons here.  One is that many other bank markets like the UK have an application fee which is not included in the interest rate but is an effective charge.  We do not have application fees here.  It would not be unusual to see fees of &pound;999 or &pound;2,000 for a fixed rate long-term mortgage so that comparison does not exist.<\/p><p>Another key element to the Deputy's point is around the capital requirement.  In Ireland, the risk ratings attached to Irish mortgages for 2020 was circa 30%.  That would compare to a market like the UK, which is at 10%, or Portugal and Italy, which are at approximately 17% and 20% respectively.  The more capital that is associated with a loan, the more expensive it is to basically provide that finance.

As the CEO of a bank, would Ms McDonagh perceive, from listening to many of the questions today, that there is a panacea and a pot of gold to be got out of Irish banking?<\/p> <p>  I am curious as to why is Ulster Bank is leaving.  While I know Ms McDonagh will not specifically answer that, why is Ireland not seen as a better place for banks to come and do business  I note that Avant Money has recently come into the Irish market and has rates of 2.35%.  I would like to hear Ms McDonagh's thoughts on why Ireland is not such a great place for banks to do business.  Why are we trying to streamline and make cost savings at all costs?  Bank of Ireland has a big loss this year and Ms McDonagh is telling us the bank is trying make money, which is why it is cutting back on jobs.  That is just a first departure.  Ms McDonagh might keep that in her mind.<\/p> <p>  Second, did Bank of Ireland avail of the TWSS or the EWSS for its staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#J01600","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>The answer to the second question is \"No\".  We did not apply for subsidies or request any Government or State support for colleagues who are full-time employees of Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's first question, again, it is worthy of a broader debate.  I cannot talk about Ulster Bank.  Questions about Ulster Bank should be directed to it or NatWest.  We have, over the years, seen smaller banks enter and then exit the market, although in some cases, they were here for a long time.  It goes back to the point about being a small bank in a relatively small market such as Ireland.  It is difficult with the investment in technology and branch network, fixed costs related to regulatory compliance and the cost of doing business, particularly in a low-interest rate environment with muted credit formation.  It is difficult to meet minimum hurdle rates that shareholders expect.  We would, therefore, see the cost of capital and expectation for investors as being approximately 10%.  Our return on equity target was approximately 10%.  That has been incredibly difficult in a low-interest rate environment and we were loss-making for the first half of last year.  Banks not being able to achieve returns over a sustained period is not a good deployment of shareholder capital.  That is the challenge.<\/p> <p>  Ireland as a place to do business is very attractive.  A significant part of our economy relates to foreign direct investment, FDI.  We bank two out of every three FDIs that come into Ireland.  We will talk about the level of education and, obviously, the language benefit as a native English speaking country following Brexit as a differentiating factor, the relative youth of the population etc.  We see a huge number of FinTech, pharmaceutical and financial services companies coming into Ireland.  Ireland Inc. is, therefore, very compelling.  It is one of the only economies in the world globally last year that actually grew despite the pandemic because of those international companies.<\/p> <p>  On banking specifically, the European banking model is challenged.  That does not mean it is not possible to grow and support the economy, which is what we are endeavouring to do.  We have invested in digital platforms.  We want to grow as the country recovers.  We would have grown our lending book for the last three years until we got into the pandemic.  Brexit is in the rear-view mirror.  There was increasing optimism around Irish businesses and households about recovery.  We have a 15% increase in deposits because some people whose income has not been so impacted have been obliged to save as there is no opportunity to spend money.  Some parts of the economy, therefore, will be looking to have an increase in consumption.  Some people will use that for deposits for houses. <\/p> <p>  There is, therefore, cause to be optimistic but the dynamic is not a pot of gold.  It is a challenging environment and that is reflected in our financials.  The opportunities are also reflected in my cautious optimism about the future, however.  I believe the relationship between the State and the sector needs to be revisited and normalised.  I appreciate the past but our focus is firmly on supporting the future of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I am curious as to why Bank of Ireland did not seek to draw the TWSS when it had a loss of &euro;374 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#J01800","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>To be honest, Irish banks seeking additional State support has not been our focus.

That is the reason, as Ms McDonagh said, we made a move a few years ago to move all our advisers out and about to meet customers and train them up in specific areas of expertise such as agri-advisers or other business or mortgage advisers.  For example, our agri-advisers spend quite a bit of time on farms advising customers.  I can give the Deputy a specific example of the way behaviours are changing and how we can support our customers.  I met a customer at the National Ploughing Championships a few years ago who wanted to make a branch appointment for a loan application.  I was able to put him in touch with our contact centre in Kilkenny where he was able to apply for the loan and by the time he got back home from the National Ploughing Championships in Offaly he had the money in his account.  That is what is happening.  Some 80% of applications are being made over the phone or over the Internet.  We have developed a skills set and expertise in Kilkenny and in Dublin where we have our contact centres.  Our staff in those centres are dealing with multiple applications day in, day out and become deep experts on lending applications for certain sectors.  That is then augmented by support on the ground.  We are out in communities.  We still have business and other advisers who meet customers at their premises.  Most of the meetings that happen face to face, which is the minority of our meetings, take place on business premises.  We have what we believe is the right balance.  The key word as we move forward with these changes is \"balance\".  We have the balance between the local knowledge and the local boots on the ground, to use that phrase, supported by people based in contact centres with deeper expertise and good Internet applications and service.  We seek to get that balance right, although it is not always the case in that we might overdo it in one channel or the other.  We are striving to adapt to customers' needs and behaviours to get that balance between that local approach and the central support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his reply.

To pick up the Deputy's point, there are alternative ATMs in Miltown Malbay in supermarkets.  To give a bit of perspective on what we are seeing happen with cash, so we believe it will be comfortable, customers will have access to an ATM during supermarket hours and they will also have access through post office opening hours.  They can also use their card's cashback facility.  As we know, the cashback facility has become incredibly popular but to take one step back from this, we have seen a 33% drop in cash over the past year.  We could say this is because of Covid but to go back to what Ms McDonagh said earlier, I believe it is a service in which we will see a permanent shift.  Keeping a bit of perspective on this, we have all become familiar with contactless transactions.  In 2017, Bank of Ireland cardholders used contactless cards 70 million times.  In 2020, this number was 170 million.  There were 100 million more card transactions using contactless payments in 2020.  We believe this is a permanent shift.  It is something that will stick.

It is about ensuring the sustainability of a business model, customer loyalty, effective outcomes, regulatory compliance and, ultimately, a long-term sustainable profitable business.

As we move out of Covid there will be a surge or an attempt to revive the economy.  I hope it will be very successful and we expect that it will be.  Reference has already been made in the course of this debate to the fact that expert opinion is important.  Who are the experts in this business?  There will come before the bank a series of people who have been badly bashed by Covid, and the same people were bashed by the downturn in the economy with the financial collapse.  I have had experience of the bank's performance in this area but it is hugely important from here on in that those who assess the viability of a project, particularly when the restrictions are lifted, know what they are at and that it does not always revert back to one person or to one or two people making a decision that impacts on the lives of those who have been in the particular business over a long number of years.  These people have worked extremely hard.  They have worked at building up their businesses.  They have sweated blood and tears to keep them in place .  It has not always happened and it has not been their fault.  It was not necessarily the fault of the bank either.  The fact of the matter is that we have reached the position we are now in.  The bank's customers cannot take a further bashing.  All I ask is that the bank is sympathetic towards them and allows them to make their case on the basis of their judgment and history, and their ability to survive where many others did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#L02400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his positive feedback, which Mr. Kelly and I will share with our colleagues.

Since the start I have joined my colleagues in conversations with SMEs and corporates.  We have spoken to the trade associations that have been most severely impacted, through no fault of their own; they have just not been able to trade.  We have a long track record in SME lending and have sector specialists who are not only bankers but also practitioners in sectors like healthcare, agrifood, retail and many others.  We will seek to support SMEs to come out of this, wherever possible.  Brexit has created a huge amount of uncertainty and underinvestment in Irish SMEs.

What type of analysis has the bank carried out on the benefit that will accrue to post offices arising from their dealings with the Bank of Ireland?  What will each post office gain from the partnership?  It has been suggested to us that the partnership will yield very little in fees to the post offices and will not make a difference in terms of whether the business closes or remains open.  What happens when a post office with which the bank has a contract closes?  Has the bank discussed that scenario with the post offices?  The branches that have been identified to be closed by the Bank of Ireland over time in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny include those in Callan, Graiguenamanagh, Urlingford, Thomastown, Borris and Tullow.  In each of those locations, there is a busy local economy strongly supported by the agriculture sector but at least one of the post offices has already been affected in terms of its viability.  In our discussions with representatives of the post office network at a national level, we referred to post offices that would have struggled at the best of times and which have been challenged.  What analysis has the bank carried out in each of those areas and what is the comparison?<\/p> <p>  The other issue in these areas is the availability of broadband.  Again, in the county towns that are mentioned in Carlow and Kilkenny, the availability of broadband is bad and delivery is not likely to happen for quite some time.  Even then, it may not be the fibre optic broadband used in more densely populated areas.  What is the future for these post offices?  Ms McDonagh has talked it up but at the end of the day, the partnership may be worth &euro;1,000 to some individual post offices in fees but in essence, it will not make much of a difference.  The bank is using this partnership to talk up the future of post offices.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of repossessions.  How many decisions on repossession does the bank have right now?  How many decisions on the repossession of family homes or similar properties are in the pipeline?  Is Bank of Ireland expressing an interest in the Ulster Bank loan book?  I am interested in the Davy issue from the point of view of the salary levels for higher executives that have been mentioned.  On the one hand, we are talking about the difficulties in Irish banks arising from the crash and the interest rates that are being paid but on the other hand, we have enormous salaries being paid to higher executives.  The two issues are not matching; there is room for salary increases but no room for interest rate decreases.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of negotiations with customers who are in difficulty, I have a question that could be posed to every bank and not just Bank of Ireland.  Where the bank is negotiating on the debt of a family, individual or business and there is a death by suicide, how does the bank separate that out and deal with in a more sympathetic and sensitive way?  Has the bank learned lessons in terms of how to deal with people in trouble in the context of getting them over the line with a better arrangement?  What has been the bank's experience in this regard?  <\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the matter of internal investigations.  First, I thank Bank of Ireland for the engagement I have had with senior executives.  While the engagement may not bear fruit, it has been positive in terms of the experience and understanding given to the customer from it.  In one or two of the engagements in which I was involved, an internal investigation was under way.  The external view on the debt was that it was affected by the tracker issue but the internal view was that it was not, very definitely.  The two views were completely at odds with each other and while the financial services ombudsman service exists and issues can be referred on, I was surprised that the bank does not use an outside resource in the context of an examination of issues that arise between the bank and the customer or an understanding of the questions that are being asked of the bank.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#M00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his questions.

In Carlow-Kilkenny, for example, there are 34 post offices between the two counties.  Our negotiations so far have been directly with An Post and we would not be privy to the onward negotiations between An Post and the local postmasters.<\/p> <p>  As we said earlier, scale is important.  We are not the first bank to use the post office but building up the scale and volume of transactions will make a significant difference to customers and to postmasters in terms of viability going forward.<\/p><p>The more services we can put into the post offices, the better.  I believe we are helping and contributing towards that.  Any other questions on that would need to be directed at the post office.<\/p><p> On the specific locations, in the south east we looked at counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford together.  There was a strong affinity between the Graiguenamanagh branch and the sub-office in New Ross in the past.  While there is a lot of rivalry on the hurling pitch between Kilkenny and Wexford, from an economic and banking perspective, we certainly see a lot of work and co-operation from the local economies as they support each other.  That is the way we will run our business to give support to customers, as the Chairman said, in thriving counties.  We believe we have adequate coverage across those four counties to ensure we support our customers as we move forward.<\/p><p> Kilkenny is a very important county to us.  We employ almost 600 people and have a very large contact centre operation in Kilkenny.  Making sure we support colleagues and customers in Kilkenny is very important to us and will be close to our hearts as we go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":628,"content":"<p>There was a question about broadband.  We have made a significant investment in our mobile banking app, with a 50% increase in functionality.  The app can be accessed without broadband through mobile networks, which have a different level of coverage.<\/p> <p>  I will now address the broader question of repossession and dealing with and supporting customers who have experienced loss, including death by suicide.  For the past 12 months, we have paused all repossession orders.  I do not have information to hand on historical or future numbers.  We can revert offline in writing.  We have not executed, implemented or progressed any repossession orders for the last 12 months, given the external environment and the challenges faced by customers during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  On supporting customers in financial distress, we have a long track record as having the lowest level of non-performing exposures, especially of retail customers, within the industry.  I will give the committee a perspective in terms of scale.  For owner-occupier mortgages that are more than 90 days past due, Bank of Ireland has only 1.9% of customers in that situation, while the figure for the industry is above 6%.  The Bank of Ireland figure is a fraction of the industry average.  We are a big part of that industry and the average figure includes us.  For buy-to-let mortgages, we have 4% of customers who are 90 days past due.  The industry average for that sector is 16%.<\/p> <p>  We are in a far stronger position with regard to the quality of our portfolio and in the quality of engagement support we provide our customers.  We engage with the customer and in nine out of ten scenarios we find a solution that is sustainable for and accepted by the customer.  For the customers who are personally impacted and vulnerable, whether it is a circumstantial vulnerability due to bereavement, illness or other challenges, we have established a specialist vulnerable customer unit for all customers, whether they are in financial distress or not.  The unit received 4,500 calls during 2020.  We have a specialist team in our credit loan support, who are among our most experienced and specialist advisers, to support customers who have greater level of vulnerability or who have suffered a loss.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ulster Bank, we take all opportunities to look at portfolios and acquisitions.  Among the Irish banks, Bank of Ireland has done the most portfolio acquisitions in recent history.  We did eight acquisitions of portfolios in the past five years.  We are not being quoted as currently engaged with Ulster Bank.  We focus on opportunities that add strategic and commercial value for our full stakeholder range. I hope this answers the Chairman's question.<\/p> <p>  I believe I answered the question on remuneration and Davy.  While not referring to Davy specifically, if we were to acquire an entity that had normalised pay, we would seek permission, as part of the current requirement under the stakeholder engagement relationship we have with the Department of Finance, for us to maintain the existing remuneration arrangements in an entity if we were to acquire it.  That is a generic response to the Chairman's question.<\/p> <p>  I have presented to this committee many times specifically on tracker mortgages.  I made it a personal commitment to address the issue.  We have a 99.8% contact and remediation rate with customers.  In total, there are only 37 customers who we continue to trace.  There were 800 customers before but we have successfully traced them.  We have put a significant amount of effort and resources into this.  We use an independent panel, which is a requirement of the tracker mortgage examination.  These are senior, independent people who review any customer appeal if customers feel they have not secured an outcome from the bank that they feel is fair.  If a customer makes an appeal, it goes directly to that independent panel.  The customer also has the choice to go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which will review all complaints.  We try to work with all customers and the numbers reflect our commitment to address the tracker issue.  I hope I have addressed all of the Chairman's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021032300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Is it possible to get the analysis around the post offices that I have just mentioned?

We believe this is a competitive fixed rate which applies to customers with the product.  Another thing which is important is that while customers do not make repayments on this product they are also guaranteed to be able to stay in their home for the rest of their life.

Today is an opportunity for us to talk through some of those responses and we would be happy to answer questions on those or related matters.<\/p> <p>  I will start by noting what members will have noted, that being, since our previous engagement with the committee, there have been further notable interventions in the discussion.  In fact, it seems that not a week goes by without another major intervention in this debate.  Members will be aware of last night's \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme on RT&Eacute; and the paper being launched today by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  There will be a shared island unit event this week and Ireland's Future is holding a major report launch on Thursday.  We have also seen further proposals emerge around a timeframe and even a suggested date for when it might happen.  In a sense, all of this underlines what we suggested at the previous meeting, that being, the momentum around this debate is remarkable.  However, it raises the question of where the debate will go next.<\/p> <p>  I will address two of the questions covered in our written response and my colleague, Mr. Bassett, will focus on the other two.  We hope that our written response will be made publicly available so that members of the public can read what we have written.<\/p> <p>  The first question we have addressed is that of how long the Northern Ireland institutions could or should continue after Irish reunification.  The Good Friday Agreement contemplates a transfer of sovereignty from the UK to Ireland, but it does not expressly address the precise form that a united Ireland would take.  The agreement and its values will shape that discussion alongside other existing obligations relating to continuity of protection.  There are clear provisions in the Good Friday Agreement that are forward facing and the committee is well aware of concerning rigorous impartiality and guarantees around identity, culture, citizenship and rights.  There should be no diminution of guarantees and protections as a consequence of a vote for a united Ireland.  There must be an equivalent level of protection in terms of guarantees, protections and rights in the event of a united Ireland.<\/p><p>We recognise the significance of shared institutions in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland as one part of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those Northern Ireland institutions will remain in place unless and until an alternative arrangement is agreed.  We believe this is part of a larger, constitutional conversation that, as committee members know, is ongoing and intensifying at the moment, around the precise form a united Ireland will take with detailed questions around constitutional design.  For example, there are proposals at the moment for a citizens' assembly to focus on some of these and related questions.  That might be a helpful channel for this debate going forward.  Whatever happens in terms of the Northern legislature, executive and judiciary, the approach will need to be consistent with current constitutional arrangements in Ireland or any new constitution that emerges, as well as other relevant legal obligations.  We highlight the sense that this is part of an ongoing, larger conversation about constitutional design.  <\/p><p> Why focus on securing referendums when important work on reconciliation remains outstanding?  We are aware that this question often comes up and we felt it would be helpful to further clarify our response.  In our view, the work on reconciliation is absolutely essential.  The work is ongoing, and it must continue whatever the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  We take that as a basic starting point.  However, our view is that reconciliation, and debates around reconciliation and a shared future, are simply not assisted or advanced by avoiding hard questions about the constitutional future.  In other words, we do not help the cause of reconciliation by avoiding doing the necessary homework in advance of these referendums taking place. <\/p><p> We also do not think the current debate is assisted by making reconciliation a precondition to holding the referendums contemplated in the agreement.  In our view, this is not an either-or conversation.  The work of reconciliation will continue alongside the referendums anticipated in the agreement.  Arguably, in our view, making this an obstacle to progress breaches the express terms of the agreement, as does the recently mooted notion that these referendums can be categorically ruled out for an indefinite or set period of time.  That sort of language runs very close to being out of step with the express terms of the agreement.  <\/p><p> Echoing what we said in our first engagement, and welcoming the chance to follow up today, our strong advice to this committee is against reopening the express terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Instead, our advice today, as in our first engagement, is that the collective focus must be on the good faith implementation of existing commitments and good faith adherence to the textual requirements of the agreement.<\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. Mark Bassett, will address the other questions in our follow-up response.  I thank the committee and look forward to the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to come here again to speak.  One of the questions asked on the last occasion, which I did not get a chance to address in full, was what was meant by external impediment in the Good Friday Agreement.  In our written response, we said that at the core of the Good Friday Agreement and the constitutional arrangements in the UK and Ireland, is that Irish reunification is a question for the people of Ireland.  It requires a vote in support in each jurisdiction but there should be no external or outside impediment.  The report looked at the position of Irish membership of the European Union and came to the clear conclusion that membership of the European Union was not going to be an obstacle, nor was membership of the eurozone.  I always thought that the phrase external impediment typically referred to the Westminster Parliament.  It would not be open to a future British Parliament to disregard referendum votes in both the North and the South.<\/p> <p>  If one thinks back to previous Irish electorates voting for repeal, Home Rule or an Irish republic, it was dependent on winning support in the Westminster Parliament.  We say that is no longer the case.  There is still a very strong, traditional understanding of the sovereignty or supremacy of the Westminster Parliament in that it can legislate as it sees fit.  Any restrictions on that choice are self-imposed.  Examples are sometimes given that Westminster could legislate to prohibit smoking in Paris or to revoke the independence of colonies.  We say that the reference to \"without external impediment\" is a recognition by the UK that it would not be practical or realistic for a future UK Parliament to frustrate those votes.  <\/p> <p>  The other question we addressed in the subsequent written piece was whether or not it has to be a binary question when the referendums are posed in both the North and South.  Does it have to be either Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom or a reunified Ireland?  We say it is pretty clear in the Good Friday Agreement that this is the choice.  It is a binary choice.  Re-partition, independence, the accession of Northern Ireland to another state or indefinite joint authority between Britain and Ireland is not contemplated in the agreement.  If that was proposed, it would require a back to basics approach to the agreement and we think that would be an unwise move.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement has formidable democratic authority.  It was endorsed in referendums both North and South.  It has formidable legal and political backing.  There is bipartisan backing for it in the United States Congress.  It is a feature of the Irish Constitution and the UK's constitutional arrangements.  It is in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement and is a matter of EU law as well as the mechanism for self-determination and reunification.  We say that a referendum will be posed in those terms.  It will be a choice for Northern Ireland whether it wishes to join a united Ireland, which is a member of the European Union, or remain as part of the United Kingdom in the Northern Ireland protocol.  That is how we anticipate the vote will be formed.<\/p> <p>  That is enough from my opening statement, covering what we had written.

I did not get an opportunity to put a question the last day, so I appreciate the opportunity now to speak in this second round.<\/p><p>It is almost 23 years since the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people in both jurisdictions on this island.  That is more than a generation ago and much has changed.  Reference has been made to the impact of Brexit, but the political landscape in the North has also changed significantly over that generation.  Twenty three years is a considerable amount of time for dialogue and discussion.  The Good Friday Agreement gave nationalists and republicans the right to democratically and peacefully pursue their objective of a united Ireland.  That is what one does in a democracy.  It is up to anybody in a democracy to win hearts and minds for their perspective, arguments and propositions.<\/p><p>Senator Currie referred to last night's debate.  One point that occurs to me is that all of the political voices who argued that they are in favour of a united Ireland or argued that they are republicans stated that we need to prepare the ground for a referendum.  We need to do this properly and that is exactly what is stated in this paper.  At the first meeting with Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett their presentation stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn our view the people of this island are likely to be offered a choice about their constitutional future in the decade ahead.  It is essential that when that time comes everyone is clear about the consequences. <\/blockquote> <p>Their paper argues that we should prepare the ground constitutionally.  In last night's debate I did not hear anybody disagree with that politically but what is missing from this debate is what form that preparation takes.  Is it endless talking shops or is there a structure to the preparation?  For example, is it agreed that we have a Citizens' Assembly?  I note with interest the speech given by Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputy Jim O'Callaghan to the University of Sussex in which he put forward some propositions, for example, that one House of Parliament would sit in Belfast and that there would be regional policing arrangements.  He is putting out some ideas about the form a new Ireland would take.  Today, another Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, James O'Connor, argued that the three coalition parties should put in place a Minister of State with responsibility for Irish unity.  There is a growing realisation politically that we need to responsibly prepare the ground for Irish unity.  I accept that involves dialogue and discussion.  I call on both Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett to spell out the structures and processes that take us forward.  Everybody agrees that in due course a referendum is inevitable, whether in five years, ten years or other period.  There is political acceptance that it is inevitable.  Therefore, it is very responsible to prepare properly.  What is the process?  Is it by means of a Citizens' Assembly, a White Paper on Irish unity or an all-Ireland Oireachtas committee on Irish unity?  Could the witnesses spell out in clear terms what they believe are the ways forward?<\/p><p>I accept there are different perspectives in our committee and the witnesses would have seen that at their first meeting.  I invite those who challenged the paper at the previous meeting, who say they are in favour of Irish unity, to comment.  In politics, as with everything in life, whether one is a manager of a football team or running a business, if one says one wants to make something happen one has to have a plan to make it happen.  I ask those who challenge the paper to say what is their plan for moving towards Irish unity.  How do they intend to advance the cause of Irish unity?  Who are they making their case to and in what format?  In what timeline should it take place?  With all due respect, I put that challenge to all those who say they want to see Irish unity.  I would like to hear a dialogue.  This is a great opportunity.  I accept there is a lot more to come.  I hope that the MP, Ian Paisley Jnr., will join us soon to discuss some of his thoughts on all of this.  He certainly indicated recently that he would.  We want to hear more voices, but today is about hearing from Professor Harvey, and Mr. Bassett who is a barrister, as they speak in their professional capacities about their paper and what they think we should do.  I invite other participants to give us their thoughts.  This is a really important dialogue, as was last night's debate.  They are my questions and that is all I have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D00700","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Do we have any other Sinn F&eacute;in speaker before I call on the witnesses to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D00800","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Could I get the answers first as other speakers got their answers following their rounds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D00900","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>That is not a problem.

The Irish Constitution will have to give proper regard to the principle of parity of esteem in its law and we have said that should also extend to EU law.  One of the points is that there will be many residents and citizens of the new united Ireland who will be British citizens.  That status will be based on British nationality legislation but it will continue in perpetuity and it needs to be respected in the new united Ireland.  There are a number of aspects of Irish electoral law in particular, which at the moment are based on Irish citizenship, so a helpful exercise at this point would be to identify what aspects of the Irish Constitution or Irish legislation are potentially in conflict with the duty of parity of esteem with the nation state exercising sovereignty in the North.<\/p><p> Other suggestions are made such as that work could be undertaken within the European institutions.  Consideration will have to be given to rights of participation in the European Parliament for an enlarged state or in the Council also.<\/p><p> Another useful exercise would be identifying how the Northern institutions - the Executive, the Assembly and the Northern legal system - will be accommodated, at least initially, and unless and until something else is agreed under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  A useful audit would be to identify if there is a potential conflict between any of the Constitution's provisions and executive, legislative or judicial power and to get ready to show that it is manageable under the current Constitution subject to amendments, which give effect to unification, and, importantly, give effect to the duties and responsibilities that Ireland will assume in a united Ireland.<\/p><p> The other aspect that could be considered is how the other east-west relationships will be accommodated in a new united Ireland.  We believe for the most part that the provisions are operable in a united Ireland, but it would be helpful at this stage if work was undertaken within Departments in the Republic of Ireland to show exactly how that can be managed.<\/p><p> In terms of a citizens' assembly, it is suggested as being helpful within the report.  It would be hoped that would build on the success of previous constitutional conventions and citizens' assemblies, draw in a membership from across the island, and make suggestions that would be part of any consultation process in advance of the referendums on unity.<\/p><p> The other point which is very important is that the preparatory work on the actual choice that will be presented to the electorate in the North and in the South should begin now.  Some thought should be given to the wording or how reunification can be achieved under the Irish Constitution.  Also, thought should be given to how the wording of the question will be posed in the North.  We do not want a situation where we end up with incompatible results or two legal or constitutional systems which are shouting at each other, so to speak, with contradictory results.  There needs to be co-ordination between the Irish and British Governments on how these concurrent referendums will take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#D01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I want to say first that my opinions in respect of the report are personal.  Coming from a very republican background, I, as much as anyone in this line, want to see unity of our people and our country, but I am also conscious of how where we have got to was achieved.  With all due respect to the two witnesses, how it was achieved has been missed with regard to their report.  For me, it does not give enough recognition to the background work that was done with regard to the coming together of the Good Friday Agreement.  Incidentally, the Good Friday Agreement was never done with a time limit over anybody's head.  It was a culmination of years of work that allowed us, in the end, to enter a room and get an agreement.  If truth be known, it goes back to the 1990s.  If the question of Irish unity was that easily settled, it could have been done with the Good Friday Agreement, so let us not cod ourselves.  This is not something that will be easily achieved, but the one thing the Good Friday Agreement did have was respect for opinion and an assurance that everyone around the table had their say.<\/p> <p>  I was taken aback somewhat by the language used in the report and by the witnesses reporting on it.  I believe they are predetermining the outcome of the poll with the continual talk of a united Ireland.  Last night, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald spoke about not putting the cart before the horse.  We all need to step back a little bit.  This is not an effort to attack anybody at this meeting because that is not useful, but we need to be honest about how we approach this issue.  I asked the witnesses several times on the previous day if they had engaged with unionism in terms of communities or political parties and they failed to answer that question.  They danced around it, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  At the outset the witnesses said they had EU oversight.  What EU oversight do they have?  I do not believe they have any EU oversight.  Their funding was got as a result of a couple of MEPs pulling funds together.<\/p> <p>  I believe their report is of a strong nationalist view.  That is grand but I believe we need to start getting a view from the other side.  I hope they take these comments from the perspective of me being helpful.  For their report to have better grounding and an understanding all round, they will have to start engaging with unionist communities and politicians because its opinion is too much on one side.  It is not grounded on enough academia.  There is too much personal opinion in it.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to knock all of the report.  Some of it is represents a useful start but I do not believe the witnesses' report is complete.  I think they could take it further and I would encourage them to do that and make an effort to start engaging with unionism because we need to come at this from a whole-of-picture perspective.<\/p> <p>  As far as preparing the ground is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not complete in all its entity.  That is the first bit of work we need to do because if we do not do that, we do not have everybody around the table.  This committee we sit on is not complete because everybody is not around the table.  If we have learned one thing over the past decades it is that coerciveness does not work.  We need to be inclusive and bring everybody on board.  People like the witnesses are critical with regard to that.<\/p> <p>  This could be a good report but there is some work still to be done.  That is my point of view.<\/p><p>Some may be critical of it but there will not be an agreement down the road unless we are more inclusive and show the hand of friendship.  Unless we show that we are all willing to share this island together, there will not be a happy conclusion to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#E00500","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I welcome the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme and all contributions to the debate.  I hope it is clear that what we have been stressing today is a need for a wide, deep and inclusive conversation, along with preparation and planning in advance.  Nobody wants a referendum tomorrow or next week.  People want to be ready and that is the spirit of what we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  We have emphasised very much in our work that one must stick to the Good Friday Agreement and its terms.  Again, I urge the committee to revisit the relevant provisions in the agreement around this.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our suggestions, we have talked about a Citizens' Assembly.  We have underlined in our work that we need wide, deep and inclusive citizen engagement.  The idea of an all-island Citizens' Assembly is a great one.  The proposal for a joint Oireachtas committee and a Minister is also welcome.  A White Paper from the Irish Government would be incredibly helpful.  Both Governments setting out the parameters of the process would be very helpful.  I would be anxious about leaving this entirely to the Secretary of State.  Both Governments engaging in advance would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, we are talking about preparing and planning in advance for a proposition.  If a political party claims to be supportive of this constitutional objective, what will its representatives say on people's doorsteps - if we are allowed to do so at some stage - about its proposals?  Ultimately, we are urging the committee to do the preparatory work in order that we have something coherent and credible to say about what the propositions of the Irish State, the Irish Government and those advocating change will actually be when these referendums happen within the next decade.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the feedback on the report and we will take Senator Blaney's comments on board.  I highlighted earlier that our report is one part of a larger body of work that we have been doing.  We have supplied the committee with some of that larger body of work.  We will happily follow up on that.  That report is very much focused on the role of the European Union.  We stressed in that report and in other work the need to plan and prepare in advance.  We are aware this is not easy.  However, I started the presentation with paying close attention to the nature of the current conversation.  The level of engagement that is actually happening is striking.  There is a risk that we fail to notice, for example, the level of civic unionist engagement in the current conversation and the level of engagement among those who find some of the old traditional labels deeply uncomfortable but want to have a sensible discussion about the constitutional future.  There is actually civic unionist engagement, as well as engagement in this conversation by people who want to move beyond the old labels.  We need to pay attention to that.<\/p> <p>  We very much see ourselves as part of that.  In my academic capacity, I felt that what we have been doing is laying the groundwork on some of the more challenging legal questions.  Other work that I have been doing in civil society is very much about engaging with civic unionism and with all elements of society.  For example, a recent event held by Ireland's Future included engagement in the conversation from people from a unionist background.  We should not underestimate or undervalue - it would be almost disrespecting it - the extent to which people are already involved in this process.<\/p> <p>  We use the language in the report and on the cover of planning and preparing for constitutional change.  We have underlined in our work that the responsible and sensible thing to do is to manage and plan all this.  In a sense, we very much agree with the committee that this should be an inclusive, broad and deep conversation.  It benefits no one on the island, however, if we run away, hide from or use a variety of techniques to deflect from doing the hard work now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I apologise as I am in transit to an appointment.

There is a kind of a jam tomorrow conversation generally.  That is not in any way denying or thwarting the conversation that is definitely under way.  It is just a comment on all the stuff that requires to be done, regardless of constitutional outlook, as well as the day-to-day stuff one has to get through as an elected representative.<\/p> <p>  Professor Harvey suggested May 2023 for a referendum.  Does he think that is achievable?  On the comment about the continuity, or otherwise, of the Northern institutions, it has been the position of both the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in that they would continue.  Richard Humphrey's legal opinion is that there is no sunset clause on them.  Does Professor Harvey see merit in them continuing, both in terms of a kind of a forum through which to manage ongoing issues around equality and so on in the North and to facilitate some of the protections currently there for nationalists?  The outcome of a border poll, one way or the other, does not solve all of our problems.<\/p> <p>  Does Professor Harvey see any potential in following other forms of devolution that might be prompted by having a Northern Assembly, whether that is opportunities for the north west and Donegal to participate in that?  Does he see devolution being a regional parliament for Cork?  Does he see basically the presence of a Northern Assembly stimulating conversations about other forms of devolution of power, such as an enhancement of the role of county councils?  I noted he said that they are not set in stone.  What vision does he have for them and what conversations might they promote more widely?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":688,"content":"<p>The continuation of the Northern institutions in the case of a united Ireland is an important aspect of the conversation and the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>The question of unity is a majoritarian one.  At the moment, 50% plus 1 is enough in the North for union with Great Britain.  It is a principle of democracy and equality of democracy that a comparable vote would be enough to ensure Irish unification.  Against that majoritarian principle there are a number of counter majoritarian principles in the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the most important of those is the shared institutions - power sharing in the Executive and assembly.  There is a duty of parity of esteem on the government exercising sovereignty and that has to be taken more seriously by the Irish State.  It probably has been taken seriously by the British State since 1998.<\/p><p> In the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme last night, there were discussions about what should happen to the title of Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and what should happen to the flag and symbols.  The state in the North is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The flag is the Union Jack.  There is no power sharing in London and a hereditary monarch is the head of state.  It is very important that the shared institutions continue but also that there is an audit of those aspects of the Irish State that could be objectionable and can be amended to ensure that power is seen and the equal protection of rights is given effect.<\/p><p> In terms of the idea of regional parliaments within the State, I have not detected an appetite for that in any of the legal or constitutional research that I have done.  I will defer to the members of the panel who would know much more about that than I do.  <\/p><p> Senator Blaney asked about engagement with unionist politicians.  To explain, this report is a legal report.  What we tried to do is identify the relevant applicable legal rules, whether they exist in public international law, EU law, UK law or Irish constitutional law.  We have tried to explain how they are going to apply in the case of a united Ireland.  That is the purpose of the report.  Some of the conclusions are very clear and some of them are contestable but we have tried to set out reasonable suggestions.  This report is one of a series that was commissioned by MEPs, one of which looked at the protection of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in Northern Ireland after Brexit.  Another one looked at the possibility of a special designated status for Northern Ireland in EU law.  This report tried to follow that template in identifying the relevant law and explaining how it might apply in these circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":690,"content":"<p>  I thank members for their questions.  I will follow on from what Mr. Bassett has said.  A few of the questions were directed towards the idea of dates so maybe I should say something about those.  The spirit in which we have conducted this work is that these referendums are likely to happen, maybe sooner than people anticipate.  In 2019, I made a suggestion around a possible date.  The suggestion was born out of a sense of frustration, which I suspect many members of the committee share.  I had been to one too many meetings where people stood up and said there needed to be planning and preparation but then everybody went home and did nothing.  My view is that very little planning, project planning or homework would get done on the island of Ireland if the date was completely open-ended.  My view, therefore, is that a timeframe is helpful to focus minds to get the work done.  Again, I am not sure how much homework would get done on this island if there was no timeframe for the discussion.<\/p> <p>  It is notable that Bertie Ahern has followed my lead in suggesting the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  I had suggested the 25th anniversary.  We notice there is a convergence in the debate around the next decade.  Their seems to be an emerging sense that we are in a crucial decade for the constitutional conversation.  As members know, Brexit has dramatically affected that debate.  To emphasise and echo what Mr. Bassett has said, our contribution is to encourage and make sure people do the relevant planning.<\/p> <p>  On the Northern institutions, we have made clear that the guarantees and assurances continue unless and until alternative arrangements are achieved.  We appreciate, as we acknowledge in our report, that there is discussion on a new constitution and new architecture.  That is why we think there needs to be extensive civic engagement in preparing for that.<\/p> <p>  On the 50% plus 1 argument, to echo something Mr. Bassett said, we are a bit concerned that people are ignoring or neglecting the assurances, guarantees and protections that are already in the Good Friday Agreement around mutual respect, parity of esteem, equality of treatment and equality in rights.  They will map forward on to the arrangements that we are talking, or they should map forward, and that is why we have talked about the sort of audit we described today.  Rather than focus on the 50% plus 1 conversation - in our view it is 50% plus 1 - we need to spend more time thinking about the guarantees, protections and assurances that will reassure people and provide security, and that are there, in relation to carrying forward the values of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The devolution conversation - the conversation around the Northern institutions - is profoundly helpful because, in my view, the Irish State is over-centralised.  One of the great positives about this discussion is that it will encourage a wider discussion in Ireland around regional policy.  Many regions on this island have been fundamentally failed, Donegal, for example, through the excessive over-centralisation of the existing State.  If this conversation encourages a wider, deeper and more inclusive discussion about the over-centralisation of the current Irish State, that would be very welcome for people in the north west, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Stephen Farry, Alliance Party MP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#G00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I will make a few observations to which Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett are happy to respond.  I stress again that I come at this issue as a non-nationalist but someone who is open to debates.  I am engaging in discussions on a speculative basis and without prejudice to whatever view we may or may not take down the line as events and developments unfold.<\/p> <p>  I caution very strongly against setting artificial timeframes for when a border poll may or may not occur.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that this is a condition-led rather than date-led process.  We are not at that stage yet but I fully accept that this is a fluid situation and that this may become apparent over the coming years.  That could happen quickly or it could be further off in the distance.  Again, we need to be open-minded in that respect.<\/p> <p>  There are two parallel discussions.  They are interrelated but perhaps they need to move at slightly different paces.  I respect that Professor Harvey is frustrated that there is not yet sufficient clarity on the precise thresholds for decision-making around invoking a border poll.  I make very clear that I fully accept the rules that were set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  I also recognise that they leave some further questions unanswered so I respect that there is a desire to get fuller clarification in that respect.<\/p><p>At this stage, I would place far more emphasis on discussing what a potential united Ireland would look like.  From my discussions with people in Northern Ireland, that is probably the more relevant and active debate at this stage rather than the mechanics of it.  That is probably where the most focus needs to be placed in the immediate future.<\/p><p> There are three different elements that one would, in theory, walk through in trying to advance that debate.  The first is about what loose or fragmented discussions are currently happening.  I appreciate that some are frustrated they are not moving on to more structured discussions more quickly, but I do not necessarily share that frustration.  This debate is still fairly embryonic, and the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme from last night reinforces that point.<\/p><p> Much more can be done to try to crystalise the arguments and engage with a broader range of voices.  Rather than simply having circular discussions, there is a challenge for civic society organisations, and our universities and colleges in particular, to convene more forums to work through some of those issues and talk about some of the grander details, not just on identity issues but matters of public finances, for example, and what would happen with health policy and provision.<\/p><p> I can also see merit in holding some form of civic forum or citizens' assembly in due course, but I do not think we are at that point just yet.  There is a question as to who would convene and organise any citizens' assembly and how that assembly would be representative.  More work needs to be done before we are at the point of a citizens' assembly being convened.  There is a bigger question because if a question were ever to be put in a referendum, governments would need to be involved in that process.  Those three phases can obviously overlap with one another but they start at different points.  I do not think we are at the second or third points just yet but I acknowledge that, in terms of a logical process, they would be steps in that wider journey.<\/p><p> It is important to take into account the magnitude of what is being discussed here.  A territory changing from one sovereign state to another is pretty much unprecedented in modern times or even in the past century.  The German reunification is not a like-for-like comparison, given the particular context there.  The enormity of this is important to bear in mind and it is something to work through in a stage-by-stage process.<\/p><p> I have made this point previously but I will stress it again.  Notwithstanding the wider constitutional and political debates around this matter, there is still significant space for practical North-South co-operation to be taken forward on a range of economic, social, environmental and infrastructure issues.  That may be a precursor to something else or it might just stand on its own two feet, but that is something I would encourage a lot of focus to be placed on in the near term as well.  I am happy for either Professor Harvey or Mr. Bassett to respond to those reflections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I agree with the broad parameters of what Mr. Farry has said.  First, it is absolutely vital that we clarify the process parameters of the referendum.  Mr. Farry will know I have been writing to the Secretary of State to try to clarify that.  It would be very helpful indeed if we knew a bit more and there was more transparency around this process because, as he has rightly pointed out, core aspects of this are condition led so it would be nice to know more about the conditions.  Other questions are being clarified in Scotland at the moment around its referendum process, and we would like more details on that as well.<\/p> <p>  Second, I agree with the sense that we need to clarify the proposition.  Real work needs to be done on this island about what the proposition is for the new constitutional arrangements.  That is why there has been such a focus on a citizens' assembly as a way to try to move this debate on.  Mr. Farry highlighted the work of universities.  In the majority of universities on this island, somebody or other is doing a project or initiative relating to this question.  There is extensive citizen engagement, which is very noticeable in the North, not just from advocates for constitutional change but civic unionist voices who are beginning to coalesce around what is starting to look like a sort of informal referendum campaign.<\/p> <p>  There are two aspects to this.  One is the co-ordination of all that work.  There is a lot of work going on at the moment.  How is that being co-ordinated?  Does the shared island unit, for example, have a role in doing that?  Second, and I mentioned this earlier, if people are going to enter a referendum campaign, what are they going to say?  I agree that not enough work has been done on the side of those advocating constitutional change as to what precisely the parameters of that change are.  We have heard every suggestion in the discussion in the past while, from what is basically a continuity Good Friday Agreement to very radical constitutional change involving a new Constitution.  The question I would raise with the committee today as regards taking forward its work is, what exactly is the proposition going to be?  When people are campaigning in this referendum, what are they going to say?  If they have not got an answer to that question, they need to start thinking about how they are going to get an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":695,"content":"<p>We agreed a rotation earlier on, so we will go back to Sinn F&eacute;in, then-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I have had my hand up for a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#H00400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I have had Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's name down for some time, but we agreed this rotation at the beginning of the meeting and Sinn F&eacute;in is next.

It is enormously important and I refute some of the comments that have been made about it.  There is real value in it because it raises key questions I have not seen raised anywhere else.  In any papers that are written there are observations and certain editorial stuff, but there is real factual stuff here, for instance, around who has the right to vote and other things.  There are also questions about engagement with others and so on.  I have yet to meet anybody who does not want to prepare or does not recognise the need for preparation.  This question keeps being raised all the time, as if there is a cohort of people who do not see a need to prepare.  We in my party see the need to prepare and understand what needs to be done, whether that be a constitutional assembly, a White Paper, an Oireachtas committee or a combination of all those things.  To move the conversation on, we need to take that question off the table.<\/p> <p>  I hear what the witnesses are saying about the responsibility of this committee regarding how we are going to carry this forward.  I am glad to have the opportunity to hear their input again today.  Arising from the discussion and recommendations the last time we met - the Chairman will confirm this - we agreed to write to the Secretary of State to ask him to bring some clarity to the matrix and the criteria he was going to use, just as Professor Harvey had written to him in December.  My first question relates to the follow-up letter he sent to the Secretary of State on 19 January.  Has he had any response to that letter?<\/p><p>I am interested in point No. 40 in the professor's paper that reunification should be presented as a vindication of the Constitution rather than an unacceptable risk to its stability.  Will Professor Harvey speak further to that?  Nobody has the monopoly on this, which Deputy McDonald made clear last night.Nobody owns the questions or the conversation around the constitutional future.  We will all have input.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the third-level sector, I was very interested some weeks ago to see an article by Fionn&aacute;n Uibh Eochach in the <i>University Times<\/i>on the role that universities and the third-level sector would play in all of this.  Does Professor Harvey have any suggestions around that?<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to other platforms.  There is a new online platform that hosts the debate around the constitutional future debate that was prepared by Professor Peter Shirlow from the University of Liverpool, and a group working with him.  Again, I believe this is really informed.

I also thank the Senator for following up by writing to the Secretary of State.  It is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  Again, the aim was to try to elicit some more clarity.  Following on from the Court of Appeal in the McCourt judgment, I am conscious that the Secretary of State has significant amount of flexibility in triggering this process.  My letters were really an attempt to try to get a bit more transparency and a bit more detail as to what precisely the Secretary of State does in this regard, for example, what evidence he relies on in reaching his judgment.  I had basic questions on how often the Secretary of State reviews the relevant evidence.  I believe this would be helpful for everyone on this island because, of course, the right to self-determination belongs to the people of this island.  Clarity would be helpful.  I have had two responses so far.  I have shared correspondence with the committee members and a bit more widely.  The committee members can reach their own conclusions from the responses.  My view is clear.  The response was from a group within the Northern Ireland Office.  The Secretary of State has fundamentally failed to answer the detailed questions raised in my letter.  To my mind this shows a profound lack of respect for the people of this island.  My questions remain unanswered.  I very much wish this committee all the best in having more luck than I had in getting detailed responses from the Secretary of State.  It is very important.  While it is not the only task at the moment, it is one part of the jigsaw.  It is a piece in the jigsaw of moving towards these referendums taking place.  The Secretary of State needs to provide detailed answers.<\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Bassett I will address briefly the Senator's second question.  Universities have a fundamentally important role in this regard.  A remarkable amount of work is currently ongoing such as the work of the ARINS project with the University of Notre Dame.  Reference was also made to the work at the University of Liverpool.  There is work going on at Queen's University Belfast, Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  In some senses the preparatory work has started and other people are, essentially, catching up.  This is all very valuable in fleshing out some of the rather technical and boring detailed questions that need to be answered in advance.  I would encourage that this work is continued.  I would also encourage the committee and others to support that work.  There is work to be done, for example, in establishing research programmes to facilitate that.  There is an opportunity to support research, for example, by the shared island unit.  I know it can be a bit nervous about going near the subject but I do not think it needs to be.  The shared island unit can talk about how we share the island now and how we might share it in the future.  Perhaps that unit could support and fund some of the work.  Organisations such as Universities Ireland, which provides a co-ordinating role for universities across the island, could support the work so we are talking to each other and analysing the sort of detailed questions that arise.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, I hope the committee is clear today, and from our last engagement, that our work is all about making sure we challenge myths, that we have an informed and evidence-based approach, and that we do the work in advance.  This is bearing in mind what Dr. Farry said about this being a condition-led process and that we are not bounced into a border poll, so that when the time comes the people North and South will know precisely what they are voting for, that nobody is painting false promises on the backs of buses, and that it is a verifiable, credible and evidence-based conversation, whatever the outcome may then be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>On the point about the Constitution, there is a lot to admire about the Irish Constitution.  It takes in fundamental rights and judicial review from the American tradition.  It has features of parliamentary democracy, which we can see have been taken from England.  A central feature of the Constitution is that it was drafted, adopted and amended with unity in mind.  Some of the most important features of the document are now Articles 2 and 3.  They can accommodate a united Ireland, subject to some specific amendments.  A vote in the North for reunification should be seen as a compliment.  For the most part and in the main, the State has been a success.  There are some aspects of the Irish Constitution that are very much admired in the North.  Participation in the referendums on the repeal of the eighth amendment and on same-sex marriage, and going further back the contribution of the electorate to approving or rejecting European treaties, was not something that was available in the UK with its different constitutional set up.<br\/><br\/>We must keep in mind that with the UK vision for Northern Ireland we can see the priorities of Britain are very different to the priorities in the North.  The vote for Brexit was not replicated in the North.  The form of Brexit that was chosen primarily by English MPs and the current UK Government could not be replicated on the island of Ireland.  The mitigation of that is the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is nobody's first choice.  Nobody would design this from first principles as the best way.  Northern Ireland is outside the European Union.  There is a lot of unionist unhappiness with the practical outworkings of the protocol.  Next year there will be an assembly election and two years after that there will be a vote on certain limited aspects of the protocol, particularly its rules on the free movement of goods, internal taxation, state aid and so on.  If there is an assembly that votes to reject those aspects of the protocol, we are still left with the conundrum that it is an EU and Irish priority that there is no hard border on the island.  It is a UK priority also.  Articles 5 to 10 that are in the protocol now will have to be amended, but something similar is going to have to come back and it is going to have to get the same sort of outcome.  There were opportunities for less divergence in Britain but there is no political support for that.  The future for Northern Ireland, the vote for union is a vote for being outside the European Union but in a protocol.  As Professor Harvey has said, the task is for those of us who do believe in Irish reunification to come up with something more attractive than what is on offer from the current <i>status quo<\/i>for the medium-term future for Northern Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

The word \"Aont&uacute;\" means \"unity\".  It is our primary goal as a political movement.<\/p> <p>  One of the interesting issues that came from the debate last night on RT&Eacute; was the fact that most people now accept there will be a referendum.  Even Gregory Campbell accepts that there will be a referendum.  One of the fascinating elements of last night's debate was the fact that the penny has not dropped with the southern Government.  A referendum will be called independently of what the southern Government thinks and the southern Government has no actual role in whether a referendum is called.  It will be called on the basis of whether there is likely to be a majority in favour of unity.<\/p> <p>  We see a reluctance of preparation among some of the southern political establishment.  We could see a referendum being called for five years' time.  Yet, the southern Government has actually carried out no practical work in preparation whatsoever for that referendum.  That would create a political crisis if it were the case.  It would be similar to the British finding themselves having a Brexit referendum with absolutely no political preparation in advance.<\/p> <p>  The type of preparation we should be looking at is convergence.  I always look at the Border as a wall with 100 bricks.  Each brick is a point of economic or social divergence.  Each brick is a significant economic or social cost to the people.  It is a difference in cancer treatment or income taxes.  It is a difference in ambulance services or policing.  It is a difference in drug treatment, third level education or road and rail infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Some years ago I carried out a report for the then Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the all-Ireland economy.  Believe it or not, it was the first report carried out in the Oireachtas on the all-Ireland economy since the foundation of the State.  I interviewed approximately 100 people from all different backgrounds in the North, including unionists, nationalists and those in between.  Everyone agreed to the logic that if we plan, fund and deliver services together, they would be, by definition, better services and more efficient.  Regardless of whether we look at it through the unity prism, it will make a major difference in the lives of people.  This type of convergence means that on the sunny day when there is unity, there will not be a shock transition since there would have been a gradual convergence on both sides of the island in terms of the economy and society.<\/p> <p>  Senator Blaney spoke about how we should not coerce people from a unionist background into a united Ireland, and I agree.  We need to attract, convince and persuade people about the benefits of unity.  The Senator's view was echoed by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste last night.  However, they are forgetting that a minority veto is a form of coercion.  If a minority of unionists decide nationalists cannot be part of a united Ireland, that is a form of coercion.  The mechanism we have in a democracy to prevent that type of coercion is one whereby citizens sign up to the democratic will and signing up to the democratic will is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am amazed that some within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael seem to be rowing back on that democratic principle.  There is a danger in this, because it suggests there is one rule for the democratic will of nationalists and a separate rule for the democratic will of unionists.  It changes the goalposts mid-flow and guts the majoritarian cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement.  I would caution the establishment parties against going down that road.  We all need to agree to sign up to the democratic will of the people, North and South.  There should be no ifs, buts or other caveats in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for our two esteemed guests regarding the issue of a civic forum or new Ireland forum.  My instinct on this is that those of us in Aont&uacute; would like to see a new Ireland forum.  We would like to see a situation whereby all in civic and political society across Ireland are invited to participate in a forum.  The purpose of the forum would be to look at possible areas of convergence that are beneficial mutually to both sides of the community, North and South, and to the rest of the island.  We could then work out what such an all-Ireland would look like.  My concern is that in a citizens' forum many of the stakeholders who exist, especially those on the unionist side in the North of Ireland, would not believe they have a say in exactly the direction we are going.  That is my question.  Should we not look for a new Ireland forum based on the model used by Garret FitzGerald around the Anglo-Irish Agreement?  Under that framework, all those from political and civic society across the island could be invited to discuss how we deal with the worst aspects of Brexit, how we converge, how we create unity of purpose and how we build towards Irish unity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#K00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak again to our two esteemed witnesses.  This is an important report.  It is important to highlight that it is an academic research tool to assist the discussion on the importance of planning and preparing for constitutional change.  There is no doubt that many people have said we need to do more work on this.  That is important to say.<\/p><p>I believe those in civic society are doing great work on this.  Ireland's Future is an organisation committed to planning and preparing for constitutional change.  It is a rights-based organisation created to protect the civil and religious liberties of all traditions and identities in Ireland in a spirit of mutual respect.  That is the basis of the organisation.  I believe that more work is required from the Government and people within political and elected leadership.  That is important.<\/p><p>I am keen to get the thoughts of our two witnesses.  We know there is a desire for a border poll following <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>survey recently in February.  It reported that 51% of the people in the North supported a border poll being held within five years.  My concern is that this does not reflect the State's readiness or willingness to openly discuss the possibility of a referendum.  What more could parliamentarians do to promote productive discussion and conversations on facilitating a border poll and referendum?  Those in civic society, including Ireland's Future, are having these discussions.  Plenty of events have taken place and another is due to take place this Thursday on the economy.  That is the reality.  People want to know.  My family live in north Antrim.  These are the questions they want answered.  They want to know about the impact on health, housing and education and what a new Ireland would look like.<\/p><p>These conversations are already happening.  They are happening around the kitchen table all of the time.  I welcomed last night's discussion.  It was a very vibrant and healthy discussion.<\/p><p> The question I want to ask is how we, as parliamentarians, can promote productive discussions and conversations around facilitating a referendum?  I have to say I am concerned, and in saying so I have to highlight the importance of planning and preparing, that at any time, the Secretary of State could call a border poll and we would not be ready.  That is my biggest concern.  That is why it is important for this committee to write to the Secretary of State also.  I hope that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#K00300","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I have one quick question.  I know the witnesses have been bombarded with many questions.  It is about the idea of a citizens' assembly.

Would it have to happen in both areas, including Northern Ireland?  Do the witnesses foresee this as a model that could work?  We talked about other models, about Garret FitzGerald and different ways of doing things.  Being a person who participated in one of the citizens' assemblies as a presenter, that kind of deliberative democracy provided a great opportunity for teasing things out and pulling things along.  Will the witnesses elaborate on how this deliberative piece could work, including some of the frameworks we have that have been used in the past successfully?

I had difficulty joining.  I endorse the comments made by my colleague, Senator Niall Blaney, that the debate has to be inclusive.  There is a danger we will not have everyone participating, including people from different political viewpoints.  I want to see a united Ireland, but if we have a minimalist approach, then we will do damage and will put back the day when we will achieve a united Ireland.  We would be denying a large cohort of the Irish people the ambition they want to achieve in the proper circumstances.  Going back to Albert Reynolds's comments in December 1993, when the Downing Street Declaration was signed with John Major on 15 December, on that day, both the former Taoiseach, the late Albert Reynolds, and Mr. Major spoke about the need not to have a minimalist approach.  They spoke generosity being needed on all sides.  It is very important in that respect that we approach this with an inclusive agenda.<\/p><p>Mr. Harvey spoke about long-term planning, and I totally agree with that.  There has to be an understanding of the other side's position.  The Chairman and I are probably the only two committee members who were Members of the Oireachtas at the time of the Downing Street Declaration and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  At that time, we clearly understood the political message that was given to us by our parties, which was the need to understand the other side's position and the difficulties they encountered in reaching an agreement.  Having talked to Bertie Ahern, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Blair and the late John Hume, and others who contributed so much to achieving the Good Friday Agreement, they were always generous, patient and understanding of the other side's position.<\/p><p>People speak about citizens' assemblies.  We have elected forums and it is these which have to do the preparatory work on what we all want to achieve in a proper way.  Mr. Harvey mentioned that the Good Friday Agreement provides the mechanism, quite rightly, to achieve a united Ireland.  That is in an international agreement endorsed by the people, North and South, on 22 May 1998.  If we were to have spoken to people in March of 1998 and said in a <i>vox pop<\/i>on any street in any county in any part of our island that, within a number of weeks, we would have a mechanism to achieve a united Ireland, I do not think the public at large at that time would have thought we would make that progress.  We have the mechanism, thankfully, but we did not have it prior to May 1998.<\/p><p>Mr. Harvey spoke the previous day about commitments already made.  Did Mr. Harvey or Mr. Bassett, in the course of their work, do an inventory of what has not been done pertaining to the commitments laid out in the Good Friday Agreement and in its successor agreements?  If we are to move successfully to achieving a united Ireland, then we must implement and maximise the potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the successor agreements.  We have seen what a lack of preparation did in regard to Brexit.  Surely, we want a referendum where the homework will have been done and there will not be a mentality on either side that they are being forced into something.<\/p><p>Mr. Harvey also spoke about the shared island unit and others have a massive role in ensuring the practical co-operation on this island is stepped up.  Institutions on this island do not engage or talk to each other anywhere near enough.  We should focus at the moment on maximising the agreements we have in place, maximising co-operation, and ensuring the &euro;500 million already committed to the shared island initiatives is drawn down and that practical co-operation for the benefit of all the people of this island is advanced.  Momentum is needed to ensure we deliver on what is achievable through those agreements, particularly the Good Friday Agreement, which is an international agreement.  That is an incremental and necessary approach for us to have in place the necessary framework to achieve a united Ireland in due time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#L00500","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I echo my colleague, Deputy Smith, in all of what he said.  I very much welcome this debate.  I would speak about the concept of a united Ireland until the cows come home.  It is something I grew up with and is something which is innate within me.  We need to have this discussion and we need dialogue between all parties.<\/p> <p>  A majority of members on this committee are very much in favour of a united Ireland.  The elephant in the room is the fact we do not have enough of the divergent voices at this committee meeting.  Referring to what Deputy Smith said, have we fulfilled the Good Friday Agreement?  Last night, Naomi Long made a very valid comment.  To paraphrase her, she said that if there is a divided Northern Ireland, there will not be a united Ireland.  Northern Ireland is divided in terms of flags.  How are we going to bring along people?  We need to bring them along.  We need clear actions and a path forward.  I will jump on that path but we need a correct path.  It needs clear actions.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, that it is about convergence.  How do we work east-west and North-South on converging our island to make it a single island and to make it stick?  A hundred years on, where are we in regard to partition?  We do not want to be 200 years on or 100 years on from a border poll and still be at the top of that hill, and still be divided.  Unionists are still very much a part of this island.  We need to start celebrating a shared history and our shared past.  Going back to my own personal story, the McGreehans landed in Castletowncooley straight after the Battle of the Boyne, when William cleared out north County Louth.<\/p><p>We came afterwards and plenty of unionists came along with that wave.  We could say that I came with the unionists and with that story.  It is part of my story and we are still living and farming in Castletowncooley to this day.  It is a similar path to that of many people on this island who are very proud of it and we need to embrace it.  We need to look at how we can jump on a path together.  It really does need to be part of a convergence and part of an inclusive story.<\/p><p> To go back to another Louth person, D'Arcy McGee went to Canada and helped to created much of the democracy there and brought together people in Canada united in diversity.  If this committee were to bring about anything it should be to be very clear that we need to be united in all our diversity.  I welcome the conversation and the debate last night but we need to be very careful that we do not march ourselves up to the top of the hill and say we will go for a border poll but leave many people behind.

There are three phases to this, namely, prior to the vote, the vote itself and after the vote.  All of these are fraught with challenges, opportunities and potential difficulties.  The way I see the preparation time and the convergence is that, as members have acknowledged, the excellent academic work is being done.  The part that is missing is political liaison and it is missing big time.  With all our articulation here today, nobody from the unionist community is giving us their views.  This is a huge gap.<\/p> <p>  The vote is one thing.  The report itemises the difficulties of exercising the franchise in the North compared with England and Scotland.  This is a major issue.  If there is a referendum and it is lost, many people will be in an extremely difficult situation.  If it is passed, there will be the alternative situation and it will also be difficult situation.  How do we jump these fences in the timeline and preparation?  The report has certainly brought about great discussion here today and it has been very welcome.  I know the witnesses cannot address all of these issues.<\/p> <p>  No report is perfect, not even one with such excellent authors as our guests.  I acknowledge the importance of the report.  The key issue is that we have to bring everybody with us, or as many people as we can.  The idea of 50% plus one will not work for a huge number of people and, therefore, we would be going backwards and not forwards.  We have to get it absolutely right.  I thank the witnesses and ask them to summarise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021032300002#M00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Obviously, I cannot address all of the detailed questions raised by committee members but I very much appreciate the comments, reflections and feedback.  We will take them on board in our work.  We are happy to engage further with the committee.  I will start by saying we have underlined in our work that we need to stick to the Good Friday Agreement parameters and framework.  Nobody here wants to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement, and this is our starting point.  The rules are reasonably clear already.<\/p> <p>  When we speak about sharing the island now and in the future, the Irish State and civil society have the capacity to do two things at once.  In other words, we must think about how we share this island better in the here and now.  Nothing we are saying is contrary to this.  In fact, we think this work needs to be stepped up and the work of the shared island unit on this is very welcome and is to be encouraged and supported.  We also need to think about how we plan and prepare for how we will share the island in future.  This is in the Good Friday Agreement.  We are speaking about the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement today.  What we are speaking about is a normal everyday part of the constitutional framework in the agreement about how we might share the island in future.  We need to address it in this framework and tone and we need to do the preparatory work on this.  The worry, and what inspires a lot of our work, is that there is a bit too much complacency.  There is a bit too much that sounds like prevarication on not wanting to do the difficult homework.  There is a sense of doing it tomorrow or putting it off until next week.  Some of the motivation for the timeframe is slight frustration that while many people do not want to face difficult homework nobody is doing anybody any favours, on the committee or elsewhere, by avoiding the hard work on preparing and planning.<\/p> <p>  There is another point on civic engagement.  At the centre of many proposals at present is the idea of an all-island citizens' assembly on Ireland's future.  Although a variety of other models have been pointed out, including involving politicians, we are particularly aware that citizens and civic engagement North and South have to be central to shaping this discussion.  It cannot be an elite-led discussion in which, in a sense, professors such as me in a university dictate the models for the future.  I would much rather that these proposals and options are discussed and debated among people and they emerge from the conversation, shaped by the evidence, expertise and comparative experience.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas, as the Legislature, has a vital role.  Nothing is either-or.  We can have a citizens' assembly and we can also have Oireachtas committees working away and doing vital work.  Too many of these discussions are dominated by governments.  We need legislatures to step up here and elsewhere to help in the preparatory task.  The work cannot be taken on alone even by a citizens' assembly.  It has to be done by others.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith made a comment on the agreement.  What we are speaking about is central to the agreement.  This is about the implementation of the agreement.  Although we are focusing on the referendums we also need to underline, and I agree, that other parts of the agreement have not been implemented.  I have spent many years of my life working on equality and human rights.  For example, Northern Ireland, the North, this region needs a bill of rights.  This is still not implemented.  It is not either-or.  We can do more than one thing at once.  This is about implementing the agreement in the longer term.  Ultimately, for those on the side of constitutional change it is about ensuring the constitutional arrangements that emerge are successful and work and that everybody is better off at the far end of all of this.

This is the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic in which, of the more than 120 million cases worldwide, more than 230,000 have been in Ireland.  Sadly, more than 2.6 million people have lost their lives, including 4,587 in Ireland, of whom 2,009 have been in nursing homes.  The continuing levels of high daily case numbers remain of ongoing concern.<\/p> <p>  Nationally and internationally, older people and particularly those in nursing homes have been especially impacted.  Nursing homes are where more than 30,000 of our citizens call home and residents of nursing homes are vulnerable to Covid-19 for a variety of reasons.  Consistent with the learning arising from the pandemic to date, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the expert panel and HIQA highlight that the probability of Covid-19 introduction into these settings depends on the level of Covid-19 circulation in the community.  Ireland has put in place a comprehensive set of public health measures, actions and responses that align with each of the ECDC-advised options to help manage and mitigate this risk to residents of long-term residential care.<\/p> <p>  Sustained communication and interagency co-operation remain central to the response to Covid-19.  Guidance, personal protective equipment, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private.  In addition, multidisciplinary clinical supports are in place at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level through 23 Covid-19 response teams.  Fundamental to this is the continued and determined professional care provided by healthcare workers in nursing homes 24 hours a day.  Throughout the pandemic to date, about one third of nursing homes have remained Covid-outbreak free, while many nursing homes that did experience an outbreak managed very well.<\/p> <p>  While there is much to be hopeful about following the Government prioritisation of vaccination of older people and healthcare workers, the challenges associated with the pandemic will continue for the foreseeable future.  A vaccination effect is being seen, however, and the number of open outbreaks in nursing homes now stands at 68, down from 178 on 21 February.  In addition, this week sees a significant step in restoring meaningful contact through enhanced visiting guidance for nursing homes, whereby each resident can now have two face-to-face visits a week in light of a high rate of vaccination in the nursing home.<\/p> <p>  Following the recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in May 2020, a Covid-19 expert panel on nursing homes was established to provide immediate, real-time learnings to the Minister for Health.  This panel made a substantial package of 86 recommendations in 15 thematic areas and was published on 19 August.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people committed to progressing these recommendations and established an implementation framework with a priority focus on key short-term public health and protective measures.  This framework includes an interagency implementation oversight team and a stakeholder reference group.  Early progress on implementation of recommendations is evident and a second progress report has been published.  In summary, the areas worth highlighting include assurance of the ongoing HIQA and HSE public health supports and in particular the role of serial testing and Covid response teams, the governance systems put in place by the HSE and HIQA, additional funding for the provision of integrated infection prevention and control measures, the delivery of sustained and intensive education and information campaigns and the establishment and preliminary work of the task force on safe staffing.<\/p> <p>  A paper reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s actions in light of the key national options in respect of mitigating and managing Covid-19 in long-term care has aligned well to the November ECDC risk assessment, and this paper was published and discussed by NPHET.  In regard to regulation, the Department is in broad agreement with the recommendations of the expert panel and HIQA with regard to the need to enhance the current regulatory frameworks for older people and the need to reform the regulatory model.  Over recent months, the Department has sanctioned additional inspectorate staff for HIQA to support a sustained increase in the frequency of inspections.  The Minister for Health has approved the development of interim enhancements to the current regulatory framework for nursing homes this year, with a view to commencing a longer-term review of nursing home regulation in 2022, and recently requested that HIQA undertake an up-to-date international evidence review of nursing home regulatory models to support and inform this wider review.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the Department is focused on interim enhancements to the legislation through a bilateral project group supported by HIQA.  Detailed work is advancing on legislative proposals that, subject to Government approval, will aim to enhance the enforcement and oversight powers of the chief inspector, including through additional enforcement tools such as compliance notices, obligations for all nursing homes to report key operational data to HIQA and make the data public, exploration of measures to enhance transparency, and increased legal underpinning of infection prevention and control obligations, along with other improvements.<\/p> <p>  Home care is essential to support older people to live in their homes for as long as possible.  Investment in home support services has increased by 66% since 2017 and more than &euro;666 million has been allocated in 2021 to provide 24 million home support hours to 56,000 people.  This includes 360,000 hours for intensive home care packages.  In addition, the HSE national service plan commits &euro;10 million to the roll-out of the interRAI standard assessment tool and to establish a national home support office.  A programme of work to advance the statutory home support scheme is well under way.  The Government will soon be asked to approve the principle of moving to introduce a licensing framework for professional home support providers, underpinned by legislation, in line with the programme for Government commitment.  Throughout 2021, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is conducting research on behalf of the Department on the projected demand for, and cost of, home support provision across a range of models for the financing of the statutory home support scheme.<\/p><p>This work will build on projections for the future demand for home support as set out in various reports, including the Department of Health's Health Service Capacity Review 2018, which forecast that a 120% increase in home support services will be required by 2031 if the health system is fully reformed.<\/p><p> In summary, Covid-19 has highlighted the important need to move to new models of care for older people.  This will involve short and long-term reform across government in order to provide new housing models, new home first care models and where long-term care is needed, that it is provided with innovative designs that can meet infection prevention and control requirements and provide a home for those who need this type of care.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan also fully recognises pandemic learning and the reform requirements, including commitments to commence planning towards a longer term rebalancing of the public-private nursing home mix.  Sl&aacute;intecare provides the overall framework of right care, right place, right time in order to support older people to continue to live in the community in their own homes for as long as possible, thereby participating to their full potential in economic and social life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Quinn to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank members for the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting.  We welcome the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Health.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Mary Dunnion, chief inspector of social services and director of regulation; Ms Susan Cliffe, deputy chief inspector of social services for older persons; and Mr. Finbarr Colfer, deputy chief inspector of social services for disability services.<\/p> <p>  As some members will recall, in September 2020, HIQA appeared before a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response at which our report on the impact of the pandemic on nursing homes in Ireland was discussed.  We are happy to take any questions regarding this and our experience of the regulation of residential services subsequent to its publication.<\/p> <p>  In respect of my opening statement, I wish to focus on the background and recommendations of HIQA&rsquo;s report on the need for regulatory reform of the social care sector, published in February of this year.  The report, titled The Need for Regulatory Reform, reinforces the insights we have gained while contending with the arrival and impact of the highly infectious coronavirus, Covid-19.  In particular, the report highlights the impact on citizens living in residential services and has raised a number of questions as to how we care for vulnerable people.  In essence, the practices and models underpinning service provision that were previously acceptable are no longer so.  It is important to note that Covid-19 has not in itself signalled the need for regulatory reform; rather, it has shone a spotlight on an issue that was already in need of urgent consideration.<\/p> <p>  As a consequence of our experience as a regulator in the sector, HIQA has submitted its views to the Government on how regulations and enforcement in the interim of wider regulatory reform could be enhanced with a view to strengthening key areas related to the pandemic, for example, infection prevention and control, staffing, governance and clinical oversight.  Therefore, our report on regulatory reform should be seen as contributing to the development of a wider social care strategy and national policy, separate and distinct from any immediate or interim requirements related to Covid-19. <\/p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s report on the need for regulatory reform recognises that social care in Ireland is changing.  The institutional and residential approaches towards the provision of care for older people and people with a disability are being challenged.  Although Covid-19 has highlighted deficiencies in the legislation which regulates social care services, many weaknesses have persisted in recent years, due in large part to the evolving nature of service provision.  <\/p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s experience of inspecting centres and assessing compliance with regulations and standards has produced a wealth of knowledge on the quality and safety of services.  It has also allowed us to develop insights into how the regulatory framework is serving the interests of people who use and provide services.  This report outlines some key regulatory areas which require a dynamic, all-encompassing national health and social care strategy and policy development.  These include the reform of the Health Act 2007 to take account of the changing landscape in health and social care services; a comprehensive review of the current regulations pertaining to health and social care services in Ireland, and the establishment of a regular review process; the introduction of regulation into other forms of care that are currently unregulated and whose service users may be vulnerable; consideration of the development of a comprehensive, integrated social care policy that considers social care in its totality; and a framework that makes a clear distinction between the purchaser and provider of services along with clear governance and accountability arrangements.<\/p> <p>  While there has been a justified focus on how we care for older citizens, it is imperative that there are equitable protections for people with a disability in need of social care and support.  Disability service providers continue to explore and develop ways to move citizens currently living in congregated settings into services in the community, in line with national policy.  In September of last year, HIQA published its annual overview report on the inspection and regulation of residential services for people with a disability.  One key finding was that residents living in congregated settings experience a poorer quality of life compared with those who live and receive care and support in community settings.  In developing new residential services, providers have said they want to keep residents within the protection of regulation.  However, the current regulations can be overly restrictive when it comes to the development of innovative new models such as partnerships between other service providers and families to develop individual responses to the care and support of those with complex needs.<\/p> <p>  HIQA welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to make home care available on a statutory basis.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme has outlined the roadmap to transform health and social care provision.  Regulatory reform is necessary to ensure that the services provided have the capacity and capability to deliver care and support that meet people&rsquo;s needs in a manner that offers quality, safety and the protection of people&rsquo;s rights.  There is also a strong argument for the development of an overarching social care policy that sets out core objectives, governance and legislative frameworks across the sector at large.  The development and implementation of such a policy would help integrate diverse forms of social care and serve to complement Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.<\/p> <p>  HIQA very much welcomes the recommendations contained in the final report of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel of 2020.  It frames clearly the steps which must be taken in order to optimise the response to Covid-19 in care facilities for the elderly.  HIQA will continue to share its knowledge and insights of the sector into the implementation oversight team that was created as a result of the panel&rsquo;s report.<\/p> <p>  It is HIQA&rsquo;s view that the provision of health and social services should be subject to a regulatory framework which is fit for purpose, adaptable to changing needs and preferences and responsive to risk and concerns for people&rsquo;s welfare.  This may, in part, be achieved by developing a policy that considers social care in its entirety, given that the principal issues are consistent across all populations who use social care services.  HIQA hopes that The Need for Regulatory Reform report forms an integral part of the debate on how we can better care for our citizens into the future.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their attention this morning.

It concerned HIQA and the upskilling of staff.  I asked specifically for information on what occurred between January 2020 and March 2020.  There was an undertaking that I would be given information on preparing staff for dealing with the new challenges.  I never got it.  The last time I saw such information was when I saw it published in the <i>Irish Mirror<\/i>.  It got the information on foot of a freedom of information request.  My question is on training and upskilling regarding infection control.  A new challenge arose in December last year.  There seems to have been a huge outbreak of Covid in many nursing homes that had not had any outbreak whatsoever in the preceding ten months.  What advices were given to nursing homes once it was identified that there was a new variant of Covid?

I reassure the committee that all staff employed as inspectors of social services have qualifications in nursing, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy or social care services.  These are the competency requirements at the point of interview.  Thereafter, there is a 12-week induction programme for all newly appointed inspectors that covers all the relevant areas, including the legislative framework, the inspection process and the methodologies.  As Mr. Quinn said, we will certainly ensure the Deputy gets that information requested if he has not received it already.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, the specific training for our inspection staff that has been very targeted relates to the national guidelines from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in the context of Covid-19 infection prevention and control.  All our staff are trained in that area, and there is ongoing didactic learning and online learning.  There is guidance and there is an assessment framework.  In addition, we have run many webinars for nursing home providers and disability service providers and their staff.  Those webinars covered all aspects of our infection methodology for infection prevention and control.  As Dr. MacLellan said, there has been an increase in our number of inspectors.  We have increased the number by a total of 12 in respect of the nursing home expert panel, and we are currently at the point of induction for many of those positions.  That will increase our inspection activity, with focus on infection control in particular.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we have an internal infection-control training programme.  It is particularly pertinent to the HPSC guidance.

Within our paper on regulatory reform, we have sought an amendment to the enforcement powers of HIQA to try to bring about some form of graduated approach to improvement within registered providers, for example, that we would be enabled to serve on a non-compliant provider an improvement notice or a non-compliance notice that would provide a staged approach to the enforcement powers that we currently have.

I read the opening statements and submissions and there is mention by both of legislation for the regulation of home care providers and research by the ESRI on how we would finance an increase in the provision of home care in the long term.  I have met a number of advocates for increasing home care services and one of the immediate barriers raised with me is the timely transfer of information and the assessment issues from the service provider, such as the medical facility, nursing homes or the care settings the people are in, to the home care setting.  I presume that requires a review of the home and an assessment of supports.  That would be particularly relevant for people with disabilities, and I have a particular interest in that.  I presume it would need a multidisciplinary team and requires a level of capacity in those settings to carry out that handover moment.  While we have heard a little about the required legislation and the possible funding of it, what actions is the HSE taking now to put structures in place?  What is the capacity among care providers to facilitate the transfer of service users from one setting to another?

I have a number of questions related to what happened in the nursing homes last year.  It makes for sombre reading that 45% of all those who have died in this State of Covid had been in the nursing home setting.  My first question relates to Dr. MacLellan's concluding remark in her opening statement that the HSE national service plan fully recognises pandemic learning and reform requirements, including commitments to commence planning towards a longer term rebalancing of public and private nursing home mix.  There is a disparate mix in nursing home ownership in that 80% is private and only 20% is public.

The HSE is looking at a reform framework for long-term residential care, including opportunities for increasing direct public provision in relation to long-term residential care which will decrease some reliance on the private sector, but also looking at the types of long-term residential care that are being provided.  One of the big learnings we would all take on board is that if we can reduce the number of congregated settings for people to live in that would be helpful in terms of protecting them around infection prevention and control.  The HSE is looking at ideas such as support villages, own-door services and different types of configurations of long-term residential care.  It has committed to that and there has been significant funding put in place to look at new types of intermediate care, rehabilitation beds within the community and expanding home care as well.  <\/p> <p>  Part of the planning around the statutory home care scheme requires that we would look at care of the older person as a new model such that there will be a continuum of care and it is not the case that automatically the decision is made that a person would go to long-term care or receive home care.  As described by Ms O'Neill, the decision-making will start with the standard assessment tool, which will look at the needs of older people and, in deciding those needs, look to what supports can be provided within the community, moving towards long-term residential care, as needed.  The new home first model is already being tested by the HSE.  The goal will be to reduce the number of people within long-term residential care and the length of time that they would spend there such that the admissions would be appropriate and then to look to the broader provision of both by the HSE in terms of publicly provided long-term care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. MacLellan.

Something we should mention also, in regard to previous discussions here, is that people should have the choice.  People will make choices about going into nursing homes.  When they do, the law is that the contract is between the resident and the nursing home.  How the HSE makes services available and how ourselves and HIQA have oversight is dependent on that law being that the relationship being between the nursing home and the resident.  When a person chooses what it is they would like for their next phase of care, what we want to do, as my colleague, Dr. MacLellan, outlined, is provide a level of choice.

Clearly, our report is centred on all these things.  The first point to make is that the incidence in the community is a very important driver to risk.  That was true, unfortunately, at the outset of this, when we were dealing with it last spring, and now it has again become very clear that as we have been going through this period, in January and February, community incidence and incidence generally is an important driver.  That is one important factor.  Dr. MacLellan referred earlier to the fact that a report will be published shortly, we hope, which was undertaken jointly between HIQA and the HSE's HPSE and which will look at protective factors and risk factors based on the data that were available.  The international evidence all points us to the fact that this is a very serious, highly contagious infectious disease whose natural history and management were, in the early stages, very important features; that congregated settings are risky environments for a whole variety of reasons related to transmission of risk; and that in the nursing home setting older people and those who have underlying conditions were particularly susceptible.  Of course, there is also the big question of preparedness that was so important then and remains so now.  There are, therefore, a constellation of factors at play here that are very important.  In the first six months of our reviewing preparedness, all the things that required stepping up have been stepped up.  It remains the case, more so than ever, that they should be sustained and that we should have long-term supports in place that would maintain that level of preparedness going into the future.  It was therefore a mixture of factors: the incidence in the wider, general population, the management of the condition, the degree of preparedness in the setting and the fact that congregated settings are inherently risky environments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Cecily Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>Regarding knowledge of the sector at the start of the pandemic, would Professor Kelleher say the expert panel is now satisfied with its knowledge of the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":884,"content":"<p>It is a key piece that has been brought out across the discussions this morning and of which the expert panel was aware.

We will all watch across the system for the impact of what has been termed long Covid.  Certainly, there is both the psychosocial response to which Professor Kelleher referred and occupational health's wider response in terms of continued symptoms and the health sector overall through the chief clinical office.  It is a matter of reviewing what we would envisage is in the response that will be required to that expected long Covid experience.  The other thing about staffing levels, to which the Chairman referred, is that one of the other recommendations arising from the expert panel concerns the workforce planning component for the continued models of care.  That will be a key part of the ongoing work across all the providers.  I just wanted to come back on those two points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":890,"content":"<p>Regarding that report, my colleague is trying to get back in.

I join others in welcoming them today.<\/p> <p>  A big feature of the first wave of Covid was that GPs were not going into private nursing homes.  It was simply, in their view, too risky to be going into them, offering a level of GP care and then risking transmitting the virus within the broader community.  Of course, there has been a significant ramping up of vaccinations since early January.  I wish to ask our witnesses whether that has improved.  Are the medical needs of people in private nursing homes now being fully met when a GP locally is required to be on site?  Are GPs coming in?  Can they come in?  Is all that being facilitated on site and off site?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L01500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I might start, if that would be helpful.  Obviously, the GP's direct relationship is with the private nursing home, and there is guidance in place on visits of healthcare professionals to nursing homes and their duties.  One of the real things we saw during Covid was the additional expert support that was needed for nursing homes to support residents, be that geriatrician support, palliative care support or GP clinical support.<\/p><p>The standing up of the 23 Covid response teams across the CHOs has been a significant game changer in the level of clinical support that has been and continues to be available to nursing homes.  One of the recommendations of the expert panel is that we move to put those teams on a permanent footing within the communities as community support teams and we are at a preliminary stage of considering how we can start that transition phase.  It will provide that there can be a lot more clinical expertise available on an ongoing basis.  That will fit well with the development of the community networks within the community as well.  It will become a much more integrated system across the public and private sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>There is a huge amount of dialogue about quarantine, particularly with regard to international travel.  Is there any quarantining happening in nursing homes?  I will be more specific in what I am asking.  I know of a number of cases where an individual may have been discharged from hospital in recent weeks but had not yet been vaccinated for Covid.  Rather than going home, it was deemed necessary that this person would go to a step-down facility, that is, a private nursing home close to the person's residence.  However, the nursing home residents had all been vaccinated.  Therefore, an unvaccinated older person went into a nursing home environment without having been vaccinated.  How is that being catered for within the sector?  That will improve week-on-week as vaccines roll out but are there mechanisms in place to cater for that?  This has caused alarm in cases and people are not aware if there are quarantining or other guidelines in place to mitigate that happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021032300002#M00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I can outline the guidance that is in place and that we would expect to be followed.

I have heard Dr. McLellan outlining earlier in the meeting that somewhere in the region of 1,300 people in that age bracket are accommodated in nursing homes.  It was broken down in discourse that some were appropriately accommodated and others were inappropriately accommodated.  It is inappropriate for anyone below 65 to be in a nursing home environment and it is injurious to their ongoing mental health needs.<\/p> <p>  I mention one case in particular which is quite public and has been well flagged in the media and this lady consents to her story being told.  The case in question is that of Jennifer Hynes in County Clare.  She is only about 18 months older than me and she finds herself in Mowlam Healthcare's Ennis Nursing Home.  Ennis Nursing Home is a fine nursing home but it is not fine for her needs.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, has been engaging and helpful in dealing with Jennifer's advocate and in dealing specifically with this case because it is almost a test case in the country.<\/p> <p>  The problem as I see it in removing someone from a nursing home environment and putting him or her into a more appropriate setting is that the process seems to be HSE-led rather than building around the needs of the individual.  What other barriers does the Department see to unlocking all of this?  The fit for each of these 1,300 people has to be bespoke.  Their needs are separate, apart and specific.  Problems are already showing up in this test case, despite the best efforts of the Minister of State and the staff around her and within the HSE.  There has been a huge effort that we appreciate but the process is about what can be provided rather than being centred around Jennifer's needs.

As we look at the programme of displacement of those with disabilities from congregated settings into the community, it takes a period of time to examine the types of housing and supports that can be put in place that are appropriate and that will meet the needs of individuals as well.  Any type of fast fix for individuals will probably not meet their needs.

Not everyone in these nursing homes is physically incapacitated.  Many of them need to walk to the village or local shop to buy a newspaper and they cannot do so.  Therefore, they rely on relatives to bring those goods to them and slowly but surely they unintentionally become more institutionalised to that nursing home and they cannot leave its environment because there is no infrastructure to take them to the village.  That is being addressed this week for schoolgoing children.  There is a plan to have schools that are accessible right to the front door and there needs to be something similar put in place for nursing homes.

I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in the context of the identification of a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses today are attending from outside the precincts of the Leinster House campus, they should please note that there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.<\/p> <p>  I remind members again of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in this public meeting.

The LVA is the representative of body for the publicans of Dublin and, pre Covid, employed 12,000 people and accounted for 30% of the national on-trade market.  We appreciate the opportunity to appear in front of the joint committee today and welcome the fact the joint committee recognises the enormous impact of Covid-19 on our sector.  We look forward to answering questions later in the session.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that hospitality and tourism have been hit extraordinarily hard by the pandemic, with the Dublin trade in particular experiencing the longest and most severe lockdown in Europe, as evidenced by the following statistics.  Traditional wet bars, late bars and nightclubs closed on 15 March 2020 and have not traded for a single day since.  As of today, these businesses have been closed for 372 days and, assuming a June or summer reopening, these businesses will have been kept closed for a minimum of 15 months.  Pubs that serve food are currently in their third lockdown and in the 372 days since 15 March last, have only traded for 105 days, or 28%, of that time.<\/p> <p>  We want to talk to the committee about our views on reopening.  We understand specific reopening dates cannot be provided at this time.  However, we are calling on the Government to publicly communicate the circumstances that must apply to allow the full reopening of the hospitality sector.  To our minds, there are four questions, as follows.  What percentage of the adult population will need to be vaccinated?  What level of community transmission will need to apply?  Will it be the case that pubs and hospitality will only be able to reopen for vaccinated customers?  Will the Government confirm that, post vaccination, the previous artificial distinction between traditional wet pubs and pubs that serve food will be eliminated, and that all pubs and other hospitality businesses will be able to open together?  There can be no justification post vaccination, in our view, for keeping wet pubs closed while allowing food pubs and restaurants to reopen.<\/p> <p>  We believe there is a strong case for the extension of financial supports for our sector.  We acknowledge the level of Government support our sector has received to date.  They have provided a real lifeline, with the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, payment in particular being essential in supporting these businesses.  However, we believe a core underlying principle for Government must be recognition of the fact that the hospitality sector will require ongoing Government financial supports post reopening in light of the extended lockdown.<\/p> <p>  We believe these supports should fall under the following headings.  First, there should be an immediate reopening support and restart grant, taking account of the extended closures the sector has endured.  We call for these payments to be set at a level double to the restart plus grant payment that businesses received last summer.  We believe short-term recovery supports are required for the immediate six to nine months after reopening.  There are three priorities in this regard: the extension of the  employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to 31 March 2022 to allow businesses return to viability and retain and grow jobs; the ongoing payment of CRSS to those businesses which cannot generate more than 25% of their average 2019 turnover because of any ongoing public health restrictions; and the third area for Government support should be a waiver of commercial rates for all licensed premises through to 31 March 2022.  Combined, these three measures are crucial to support the industry&rsquo;s ability to retain staff and, over time, to rebuild employment levels in our sector.  It must be a strategic priority for the Government to reduce youth unemployment across the country and our sector is well placed to do that.  Longer term, we seek supports to improve viability.  In that regard, we seek the retention of the 9% VAT rate right through to the end of 2025.<\/p> <p>  We would appreciate the joint committee&rsquo;s support in recommending the following to Government: first, the extension of those financial supports I have outlined; second, the clarification on reopening scenarios for our members and what, if any, public health restrictions might apply post vaccination; and, third, confirmation that there can be no justification for keeping wet pubs closed while allowing other parts of the hospitality sector to trade in summer 2021.

First, we express our deepest sympathy and condolences to those who have lost loved ones to the pandemic over the past year.  From the outset, we have urged all our members to support and adhere to the public health measures in place at any given time, and we continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  We represent 4,000 family-owned and family-run small businesses in every parish, town and city outside County Dublin.  The majority of those businesses, as Mr. O'Keeffe outlined, have been closed for over a year, except for a two-week trading period in September and for those that have a food operation.  It is not just those families who are suffering, it is also their staff, the musicians who play on the premises, the comedians who perform at the venues, the large and small suppliers, local and national, of both food and drink, and the service people who ensure refrigeration and other services are running to required standards.  The list is endless.  Members and those dependent on them for their livelihood are suffering both financially and mentally.<\/p> <p>  No business can be financially healthy if closed for a full year.  Yes, the Government's supports have been welcome and helpful, but they are a long way short of meeting the ongoing outflows of cash.  That is before we look at financing and banking activity.  Some of the banks, despite their soft public words, are certainly not being supportive to the level required.  What is required from a financial point of view?  Currently, there is a need for a doubling of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, to help businesses to be in place when reopening happens.  A substantial restart grant will have to be put in place prior to reopening.  By \"substantial\" I mean double the restart grant plus of 2020.  On reopening, there must be an extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, until the end of March next year, an extension of the CRSS for those businesses categorised as able to open but trading at less than 25%, an extension of the waiver on commercial rates until March 2022, an extension of the 9% VAT rate to 2025 and, in particular, a system of making finance available to those who want it at very low interest rates over a ten-year period but outside the main banking structures.<\/p> <p>  The past year has been very challenging mentally.  Publicans, by their nature, are used to dealing and mixing with people.  When one combines this with the financial losses and concerns and worries, it is not a good recipe.  The pressures have been exacerbated by a lack of clear messaging over the past year from the Government.  On a number of occasions publicans were ready to open, with stock in place at serious cost and staff ready, only for the rug to be pulled at the last minute.  At a time when the Government was advising members of the public to mind their mental health, it was the cause of adverse mental health effects in this sector.  The artificial divide between food and non-food pubs also created unnecessary divisions and pressures.<\/p> <p>  The sector now needs a clear roadmap outlining the conditions that must be in place for reopening, including the levels of vaccination, community transmission, hospitalisation and so forth.  It is a roadmap, not dates.  Hope is necessary, and there is none at present.  Such a roadmap would provide hope and would help to reduce stress levels.  In addition, we must have a clear statement from the Government that all hospitality outlets will be allowed to open at the same time, under the same conditions and subject to the same sanctions.  There must be no more divide between food and non-food outlets.<\/p> <p>  The challenges have been, and are, great.  The sector has been impacted more than most.  However, with the proper supports, as I have outlined, and a clear roadmap we will emerge at the other side ready and willing to be the hub in the community again, to be an employer again, particularly of young people, to be the provider of opportunities to musicians and entertainers again and to playing an integral part in a recovering tourism offering.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee for the opportunity to outline our position.  We hope the committee will impress upon the Government the need for both the financial supports I outlined and the roadmap.

Public health is always the first priority for hotels and guest houses, and we reiterate our full support for the Government in the task of suppressing Covid-19.  We thank the Government for the supports that have been put in place to help our industry.  They are making an enormous difference to our prospects for survival and recovery, as well as to the 270,000 people whose livelihoods we are trying to protect and restore.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has had a catastrophic impact on our industry, manifesting itself in substantial job lay-offs, revenue losses and a significant reduction in the financial reserves.  We estimate that revenue across the hotel sector fell by more than &euro;2.5 billion last year, an unprecedented drop of 60%, and the immediate outlook remains exceptionally challenging this year, with record low business levels on our books due to the high level of uncertainty about reopening.  Key to restoring the livelihoods of 270,000 people who worked in our industry before the pandemic is the survival of the businesses that can drive recovery, but additional financial supports and measures are required to achieve this.  The investment from the Government is small relative to the malaise of enduring unemployment and can be offset quickly by a reduction in unemployment supports.<\/p> <p>  The key Government supports required are: extending the EWSS and the local authority rates waiver until the end of March 2022; a doubling of the CRSS payments irrespective of the level of Covid restrictions, as well as removing the current &euro;5,000 weekly cap; a new restart grant that is double last year's payment; extending tax warehousing and deferring payback by one year; a clear commitment to retain the 9% VAT rate until at least 2025; a 70% refund of energy and pass-through charges.  Key banking and finance measures are also required.  The Government must ask the regulator and banks to take a longer-term view in their approach to our sector by providing bank loan moratoria and employee mortgage deferments.  The future growth loan scheme should also be reactivated.  Some businesses will require recapitalisation when the pandemic is over.  Consideration should be given to providing equity and debt finance incentives to see our industry into full recovery.<\/p> <p>  Prior to the Covid pandemic, our industry supported one in ten of all Irish jobs, with 70% of those jobs outside Dublin.  In some cases, entire communities are dependent on tourism.  In the aftermath of the last financial crisis, tourism was the number one creator of jobs.  We want to play our part in Ireland's recovery but can only do so with the Government's continued supports.  We will be happy to answer any questions the members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":915,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by the president of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Mr. Mark McGowan.<\/p> <p>  As we are all aware, Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on lives, livelihoods and society in general.  Some 4,588 people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 and the association's sympathies go to their families and loved ones.  We also think about the 280,000 people who work in hospitality and tourism and who have had their lives turned upside down.<\/p><p>Half of those employed in hospitality work in restaurants, caf&eacute;s and pubs that serve food.  We are here today to offer insight on how Covid-19 has impacted upon the restaurant and food service sector and to propose supports for the survival of a sector which has had restricted trading for more than a year now.  Let us be very clear that we trust the medical advisers.  We do not want to open before it is safe to do so.  We are looking for the metrics on how we can reopen our businesses safely and the plan that will allow us to see light at the end of the tunnel.  <\/p><p> Hospitality businesses are on the brink of collapse.  Some 50% of restaurants face permanent closure.  Reopening our businesses viably with indoor dining is our first priority.  The narrative of a summer outdoors does not work for restaurants.  We need a plan to re-employ staff and, above all, our industry needs hope.  Current business supports do not go far enough for our industry.  Continuation of the EWSS at the current rate is crucial.  The Covid recovery support scheme must be extended to include level 3 restrictions and the current rate doubled to cover fixed costs.  Businesses previously excluded due to a lack of fixed premises, such as contract and event caterers, must be included in financial supports going forward.  A restart grant equivalent to eight weeks of CRSS is needed for reopening costs.  The commercial rates waiver must be extended until the end of 2021 and the current VAT rate of 9% must remain in place until 2025.  <\/p><p> As we start on the road to recovery, we have a number of challenges.  There is little to no payment on business interruption from insurance claims.  Commercial landlords are seeking full rents for the period of closure with some charging interest on arrears, to add to the misery restaurant owners are going through at present.  Utility providers are disconnecting services to restaurants and hospitality businesses.  The banking sector is blacklisting hospitality businesses and workers by way of declining mortgages and loan applications.  Local authorities are issuing commercial rates bills while businesses are in lockdown, having traded for a maximum of 64 days since last March.  With only 20% of restaurants able to avail of outdoor dining, the current regime is wrapped in red tape, major associated costs and extreme restrictions.  There is no restaurant or gastropub representation on the boards of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland or the tourism recovery oversight group.  The chef apprenticeship scheme is cost-prohibitive with very little output of qualified apprentices based on the size and scale of the industry.  Finally, there is a lack of a joined-up approach by State bodies with responsibility for tourism and hospitality.  <\/p><p> Urgent action is needed to ensure the restaurant and hospitality sector survives.  I thank the committee for taking the time to hear our concerns and reading our proposal for supports.  We are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cummins and all our guests for presenting today and sticking so tightly to the time.

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  I fully support them and all their members.  Since I am from Cork South-West, a constituency that relies very heavily on tourism, I am well aware of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their sectors.  This year's St. Patrick's Day really rammed home how devastating an impact it had.  For the second St. Patrick's Day in a row, and for the second week in two consecutive years, pubs, restaurants and pubs that serve food were closed.  The enormous impact the pandemic has had on the sector really hit home.  It left me with a real sense of melancholy.  It also reaffirmed that we really need to step in, as a Government, to save incredible businesses that were and are viable.<\/p> <p>  It is really encouraging that despite the fact the witnesses represent slightly different sectors, the requests are clear and consistent.  These include the continuation of the EWSS and the increase to, and continuation and extension of, the CRSS to include more businesses.  We have to get behind and support the need for another restart grant, which is coming across quite clearly, the extension of the 9% VAT rate until 2025 and the rates waiver extension, until the end of the year at the very least. <\/p> <p>  A couple of the witnesses have clearly pointed to the idea of a roadmap.  In meetings with several sectors, most recently with the Cork south-west hotels groups, one statement that really hit home is that businesses crave certainty.  At the moment, they do not have that.  We need to step up to the mark, provide that certainty and roadmap and get rid of the mixed messaging which has done no one any favours.  <\/p> <p>  The representatives touched on banking and finance and to make it easier to decide who will answer, I will go to the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, on this one.  Would a standard banking approach be welcome?  My understanding, after speaking to hotels, is that there is a complete variance in approach from different banks on the terms they discuss with businesses.  We had a scenario where there was a blanket moratorium on repayments for a period, which was really helpful, but after that businesses were left to fend for themselves.  Do we need to grab the banks by the scruff of the neck, for want of a better term, and lay down a standard approach for dealing with businesses in providing finance?  We need to get rid of the idea these businesses are not viable because they have been viable and will be again.  We need to look again at a moratorium on payments and how to deal with payments.  That is a question for the Irish Hotels Federation.<\/p> <p>  On the voucher scheme, I will put an idea to the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  I spoke previously about the idea of a voucher scheme.  I suggested a voucher scheme for those who were over 65 and had received the vaccine.  I must say it received a mixed response but the response from the hospitality sector was quite positive.  I am quite confident that July and August will be very strong for the hospitality sector but after that, in September, October and November, there are fears of a bleak cliff edge.  A voucher scheme does not have to be for the over-65s.  It can be broadened to include much more but it is clear that the stay and spend scheme did not work.  There was only a 0.2% uptake because it was only a tax relief.  People were not willing to take it up because of the way it was structured but putting a &euro;100 or &euro;150 voucher in people's hands would really make a difference.  I would love to hear the witnesses' opinion on whether something like that would work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#C00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy he only has a minute and a half left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#C00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":921,"content":"<p>My last question is on insurance.

What this has meant is that unnecessary, restrictive credit policy is hiding behind this case-by-case method.  We ask the Government to engage with the banks and the Central Bank to review this approach because it is our understanding that about 80% of our members would apply for a moratorium if it was available.

The State agency with responsibility for tourism development is F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but it does not have responsibility for hospitality.  This is where there is a blurring of vision and we must review how all our State agencies work on behalf of the State and whether they are fit for purpose.  The last time we did this was in 2003, when we merged Bord F&aacute;ilte and CERT.  In this crisis we must do a review and ensure we have a fit-for-purpose State apparatus to support both tourism and hospitality.  It is where I see this moving.

Talking about outdoor dining in an Irish context is, by and large, a red herring.  Businesses will not be viable with just outdoor dining.  The Deputy represents a constituency where there is a big dependency on tourism.  Last year, that constituency would have lost quite a lot and there would be a cumulative effect in losing business this year.  Many of those businesses will not recover if they lose two seasons.

The previous speaker mentioned that this is Ireland and one cannot necessarily sit out even in the summer months and be guaranteed good weather.  Has there been any confirmation from the Minister or the Government on direct grants for outdoor dining?<\/p> <p>  Is there a restaurant or pub representative on the tourism recovery oversight group?

In his opening statement, Mr. O'Keeffe posed questions about data and the circumstances that would govern pubs reopening, particularly in the context of the percentage of the population vaccinated, etc.  That would be useful information and it would allow the groups to plan for when the time comes.<\/p><p>I suggest that as a committee we write to the relevant Ministers, asking them to furnish us with that sort of information, which clearly every single sector represented here today is crying out for.  <\/p><p> I have a question on the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  How long into 2021 will the scheme be available?  As far as I am aware, the restart grant scheme closed for applications at the end of October 2020.  Has there been an indication that it will be available to businesses reopening this summer?  I will leave it at that.  I have one final question.  As was mentioned, we proposed a voucher scheme to the Government last year, but instead it chose to go with a scheme that turned out to be a flop.  I ask each representative to answer on a \"yes\" or \"no\" basis whether they would be in favour of a voucher scheme for this summer to encourage tourism and people to eat out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#D01000","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":936,"content":"<p>There is a little over two minutes remaining.

There are two issues that the committee should bear in mind.  The first is that the artificial limit of 15 has no commercial relevance; it is not viable for us.  We firmly believe that the limit should be related to the outdoor space available, socially distanced.  If a premises has a lot of outdoor space, it should be able to take a large amount of customers.  If it has limited space, then unfortunately it should only be able to take a limited number of customers.  It is not commercially viable to open for food business for 15 customers when a chef, waiting staff and potentially bar staff have to be brought on board.  The limit should be related to the space available.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that outdoor dining applies to less than 10% of the pub trade in Dublin.  It is essentially closure by another name.  While we welcome the opportunity to trade outdoors, it must be noted that the vast majority of pubs in our capital city will not have an opportunity to trade in that scenario.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":939,"content":"<p>In respect of the CRSS, it is promised to run until the end of June.  In our own hotel, we are able to apply for the full value of the scheme, which is &euro;5,000.  To give the Deputy a sense of where that money goes, it is used to pay insurance and does not even cover light and heating costs.  There are also other expenses in respect of maintenance, contracts, etc..  Our light and heating costs are around &euro;3,000 per week, but of that, 53% is made up of pass through charges, which are Government levies, and is a huge proportion.  While we might be getting an inflow of &euro;5,000, equally &euro;1,500 is going out, so the net gain is essentially &euro;3,500 per week.<\/p> <p>  The cash burn is immense.  To give the Deputy a sense of it, when we talk about reopening grants, we were not even closed for the six-week period.  Our own hotel in Adare was open for essential workers.  Even though we were open for those six weeks, it will still cost us &euro;120,000 to actually reopen in earnest.  I fully appreciate all the reasons we, like the rest of the country, had to close in the week after Christmas, but there was an additional loss of &euro;20,000 in terms of stock, etc.  That will give the Deputy a sense of it.<\/p> <p>  The other question that she asked concerns the voucher scheme.  We absolutely support any system that stimulates demand.  However, there are lessons to be learned from the UK in its approach.  It included everyone, happened at source and also applied to off-peak times.  That is something of which we should be mindful.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the months of July and August.  In the context of hotels, only 21% of bedrooms are booked at this point in time.  We have had no net gains in the last three weeks, as anything that has been gained has been offset by cancellations.  Therefore we are not looking at a buoyant summer ahead.  In fact, it is fair to say that there is an acute lack of hope.  For some, it is the hope of a staycation, and for others it is the hope of bridal couples who want to get married after setting the date for the fifth time.  However, for the 270,000 people in tourism and hospitality, their livelihoods are very much on hold as part of this pandemic.  We should never lose sight of our goal.

I know there has been a discussion on this issue.  Many of those in the tourism sector previously predicted problems with the scheme and, as we have seen, some of them have become a reality.  It was budgeted to cost the Exchequer &euro;27 million.  My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, submitted a parliamentary question on this issue and the figures were very low.  I believe the related expenditure was around &euro;9,200,000.  It was far less than had been budgeted.  Obviously, we have been in lockdown.  I have spoke to people in the industry and some of them said that the scheme was very cumbersome and bothersome.  Do the witnesses see the value in the scheme for the sector?  Is it something which they see as being a benefit to them in the sector?  I know that the scheme does not cover alcohol, so perhaps I am not directing my request for comments to the vintners in attendance today.  As it is currently envisioned and laid out, is this scheme working for the sector or do we need to look at a scheme like that in operation in the UK, where the emphasis is put back on Government to pay part of the bill from an invoice from the tourism or restaurant provider?  Is the scheme working?  Is it going to actually benefit those it is supposed to benefit?

It was an eye-opener.  The one thing we all have in common in this committee is that we want to show our support to the tourism industry and to see it up and running as soon as possible.  I heard Mr. McGowan this morning on my local radio station, LMFM.  He gave me warning signs when he said 80% of restaurants are tenants as such.  In other words, landlords are running the restaurants.  That put a bit of fear in me.  Mr. Cummins mentioned utility companies imposing high bills and commercial landlords seeking full payments.  These all seem like warning signs.  It is important going forward that the Government gives full supports, not only financially, in getting tourism up and running.  I come from Dundalk and I think we now appreciate what hotels, pubs and restaurants do considering the amount the queues I see outside takeaways in the lashing rain or outside pubs taking away drinks and everything else.  It is something we took for granted.  Many people in Ireland go on foreign holidays but they appreciate what the witnesses' organisations are doing at the moment in trying to get some normality back.<\/p> <p>  Are there many businesses in this country being run by landlords?  Are there many people who own pubs, hotels and restaurants who are tenants?  Coming from a business background, I know if one is a tenant paying a landlord, most of the money paid is going back in taxes.  In turn, the Government should be giving it back to the likes of the witnesses' organisations to get businesses going.  That is a real concern of mine.

The most exposed category across the hospitality sector consists of businesses that are leased.  They are essentially at the mercy of the landlord and the level of landlord support for their business will be the crucial determinant of whether they survive this or not.  The RAI has said and we have it in our submission that there needs to be an immediate doubling of the CRSS payment to help businesses deal with fixed costs.  Irrespective of whether a business is leased or mortgaged, the biggest fixed cost will relate to the property.  In round figures, in the Dublin pub trade fixed costs are somewhere between 20% and 25% of normalised turnover.

Regulation of the banks is most important.  A moratorium has to come in and there should also be a moratorium on rents.

They made very compelling presentations outlining how difficult this period has been for the sector.  I assure them that there is a very deep awareness in Fine Gael of the challenges the sector has faced in the recent past and is likely to face in the coming months.  This subject is discussed at length at our parliamentary party meetings.  We will be having another such meeting this evening at 5.30 p.m. and I expect it will be discussed yet again.  We have a group of Deputies and Senators who are acutely aware of the challenges the sector faces and who represent both urban and rural Ireland.  I assure the witnesses that I will be advocating that any of the supports that are critical to the survival of the sector remain in place until such time as they are no longer required and there would be significant support for that within my party.  If one looks at the response of the Government to date, one could argue that it has done an excellent job in extending supports that are unique to the sector represented by the witnesses.  I have received many representations from other sectors seeking access to similar supports but that is simply not possible at this time in the context of the resources available to us.  It has been acknowledged by the Government that the sector is the worst impacted of all and the supports that have been extended to it reflect that.<\/p> <p>  I support the call for this committee to advocate for the sector to have immediate representation on the tourism recovery oversight group.  The sector is, by definition, an integral part of our tourism offering and always has been.  I know from work done by the Vintners Federation of Ireland and others how important our pubs, restaurants and hotels are in attracting tourists from around the world.  It is almost a no-brainer and would could ask why anyone would need to do research on that question.  I assure the witnesses that they will have my support in their efforts to gain immediate representation on the tourism recovery group.  Furthermore, they will have my support for Mr. Cummin's suggestion that they would have seats on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in the longer term.  If an entity is established to determine how we recover and support our tourism sector and the hospitality sector is not represented on it, that must be resolved quickly.<\/p> <p>  If not today, perhaps Mr. Cummins and I could have a conversation in the near future on the chef apprenticeship scheme, which he described as being cost prohibitive.  I know from speaking to the current Minister for Education and to previous Ministers in that role that there is very significant ambition in the Department to enhance our apprenticeship opportunities.  If Mr. Cummins is arguing that the apprenticeship process as it applies to his industry is cost prohibitive, I would like to learn more and I thank Mr. Cummins for making that information available to us.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the voucher scheme that was established last year has not succeeded in doing what was intended.  Mr. McGann made the point earlier that we should find a way to use technology to allow for the seamless transfer of the voucher to the intended recipients in the sector.  That is something we should explore in the short rather than the long term.  The supports that are already in place are financial, in the main, including the wage subsidy schemes, rates waivers, the CRSS and the restart grant.  Are there any other supports, apart from financial, that we could provide to the sector, perhaps in the regulatory space, that would help it to return to business and a successful trading model as quickly as possible?  Is there anything that can be done within the regulatory environment that would make that process more straight forward?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I assure the witnesses that they have my absolute support and that of the Fine Gael Party in negotiating what are uncharted waters for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#J00800","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":991,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cannon.

An apprenticeship scheme is very prohibitive from a cost basis because when an apprentice goes to college, the employer has to pay the apprentice while he or she is there.  In other apprenticeship schemes, the State covers that cost.  The cost can be between &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000, depending on the number of days the apprentice is in college.  It is very cost inefficient for us and is not fit for purpose.  We need to look at it from an efficiency point of view.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the regulatory environment, there are 22 different licences that we must deal with in the restaurant industry.  One example is the outdoor seating licence.  Applications for that licence should be moved online, the process should be uniform across the country and the fees for same should be waived during this crisis.  We can determine how to reintroduce those fees in the future.  Business improvement districts levies should be waived.  Indeed, all such levies should be abolished while we are in this crisis.

An 80-bedroom hotel could be paying &euro;2,500 per week in pass-through charges for water and electricity.  That amounts to basically recycling the CRSS money.

One is specific to the Central Bank, as financial regulator.  We met representatives from the bank in January and suggested that while our sector remains in level 5 lockdown or, heaven forbid, enters level 5 lockdown in the future, an automatic mortgage payment break should be put in place.  The financial response last April was very good because a sector-wide and industry-wide mortgage payment break system was put in place for six months while we were closed.  It is now considered on a case-by-case basis.  The entire industry, spanning pubs, restaurants and hotels, is in level 5 lockdown.  A regulatory solution to provide for that would be that, during a level 5 lockdown, any business should automatically qualify for a mortgage payment break for as long as it endures.<\/p> <p>  My second point in response to Deputy Cannon's question on the regulatory framework for recovery is that, clearly, the wet bars have been the worst affected, but the late bars and nightclubs have been almost as badly affected and are facing potentially a slower reopening.  The special exemption order costs are enormous.  The regulatory framework around late trading is prohibitive, bureaucratic and expensive.  We know the Government is about to embark on a process to re-examine late trading conditions.  We certainly believe there is an extraordinary strong case to be made for making that far more business friendly and allowing the late bar and nightclub sector an opportunity to recover from the ferocious closure that they have endured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":997,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Fenn wish to come in on that point?

Also, I thank those who contacted us in the past day or two ahead of the meeting.  We had the opportunity yesterday to raise some of these points, as I did, with the Minister with responsibility for tourism who was in the Seanad yesterday for a two-hour debate on issues relating to the hospitality and tourism measures.  We were able to bring to her attention the demands that have been laid out in respect of the CRSS payments, the commitment to the 9% VAT rate, rates waivers and so forth.  I brought those directly to her attention yesterday.  Also, and this is the crucial part, in terms of the roadmap, Mr. Anderson and others have spoken about the fact that tensions are undoubtedly rising with people wanting to get back trading.  It is not about just the financial supports any more.  People want to start trading as well.  I would ask the three representative bodies about that.  Starting with the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the points made by Mr. O'Keeffe and Mr. Cribben, during the previous lockdowns we saw a divergence between the way Dublin was handled and they way the rest of the country was handled.  There are a few reasons for this.  One related to the different rates of the growth of the virus in Dublin versus other areas.  Mr. Anderson alluded to the crazy situation of pubs that serve food being treated differently from those that do not serve food, which only led to ludicrous scenarios, especially down the country, with pubs suddenly operating pop-up pizza parlours and so forth.  That is nonsense and needs to be hit on the head straight away.<\/p> <p>  Is there a joint approach on the part of the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association towards addressing this?  The last thing I want is a divergence between the way Dublin is handled and the way the rest of the country is dealt with in the context of that roadmap.  Undoubtedly, there is a difference between them even in the layout of pubs.  Mr. O'Keeffe alluded to this point and said it should be done on the basis of space.  For example, Mr. Anderson's pub, Lemon &amp;amp; Duke, which is located down the road from these Houses and which we frequent, would be very different from the layout of my local pubs back home in Navan, Paddy Fitzsimon's or P. Clarke's Bar in Navan, which Mr. Cribben would know well.  They are very different pubs.  In terms of trying to get a one size fits all solution for all pubs around the country, do the Licensed Vintners Association and the Vintners Federation of Ireland have a joint approach to dealing with the Government when they get the opportunity to lobby?<\/p> <p>  On restaurants, I agree with what Mr. Cummins said 100%.  He said 20% of them are only equipped for outdoor dining, which is interesting.  As Mr. Cribben said, one is as liable to get a hailstone shower as a burst of sunshine.  We dealt previously with the VAT rate when it was increased.  Mr. Cummins stated that an increase in the rate would put people in the sector in a precarious position.  He said 50% were on the verge of collapse.  What is his fear for the members of Restaurants Association of Ireland for the rest of this year?<\/p> <p>  With respect to the Irish Hotels Federation, the Minister touched on the impact of the drop in revenue for the sector many times during yesterday's debate.  Mr. Fenn and Ms Fitzgerald Kane said there was a 60% drop in revenue.  Obviously, the international market is key in the context of visitors coming to the country.  The Minister referred yesterday to the digital green certificate but she made the point that we should not raise hopes about a quick return to international tourism.  She played that down very significantly.  If that is the case, what impact will that have on the revenue of the members of the Irish Hotels Federation if only the domestic market is allowed return for say the next 12 or 24 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#K00500","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":999,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I want to talk about licensing laws.  Yesterday, I spent my time during statements with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, speaking about night life and licensing reform.  It has been said in more recent questions and answers that we can reopen the night economy on the same basis that it closed.  I could give myriad numbers, and the witnesses know them all well, as to why we need change.  In Dublin and other urban areas I see a huge need for space and venues.  In many instances, I see people who would run events or who would open a pub or a venue opening cafes instead.<\/p> <p>  We have reached a point where we have approximately 20% of the nightclubs we had 20 years ago.  There were 500 nightclubs in the State and it is down to 100.  God knows what that will be after the pandemic.  Pubs are not growing in numbers either.  It has been referenced here that a number of things need to happen.  The change being spoken about in licensing law reform absolutely needs to happen and businesses need to be given more flexibility.  There is also consumer demand for 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. closing times.  We need pubs, venues and restaurants to embrace the changes that I hope the Government will make.  What is the response of the witnesses to potential changes in opening hours?  Is there an appetite among their members to meet the demand that exists for licensing law reform and for restaurants?  Do the members of the witnesses' organisations want to provide entertainment later into the night?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#L00500","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>We agree entirely with the Senator.  There is a need for licensing reform.  Our submission to the night-time economy task force called for 5 a.m. trading to be available seven nights a week in our capital city under strict licensing conditions and for much later trading to become available.  We think the special exemption order process in terms of cost and bureaucracy is completely out of date and will be an inhibitor to our recovery.  The detail of how this is reviewed and modernised is very important to us.  The capital city needs later trading to cater for obvious domestic and, please God, tourist demand when we reopen.<\/p> <p>  We note from the comments of the Minister on the proposed licensing reforms that she intends to regularise Sunday hours, something for which we have been calling for many years.  We also note that she intends to provide new formal licensing for cultural venues.  We have some concerns about this to be frank.  We need to see the detail.  We do not want it to be a backdoor into the licensed trade.  There should be one simple rule, which is a level playing field with the same licensing and same costs for all involved in the selling of alcohol.  We need to see the detail of what is involved in a cultural licence being granted and make sure it does not become a backdoor into the licensed trade and that it is for genuine bona fide cultural events.

We have no great objection to renewal or review of the night-time industry.  We should look at why the number of nightclubs has faded over the years.  In 2008, the cost of operating beyond normal closing time went to &euro;410 per night but that was only the commencement of it.  The other big issue, and Mr. Anderson referred to it earlier, was that it became almost impossible to get insurance for running anything that had a dance licence attached to it.  I can give the example of somebody whose insurance was a six-figure sum at &euro;108,000.  He closed his nightclub, which was only running one night per week, and his insurance reduced by two thirds.  Insurers have had an absolute aversion to looking at the night-time economy and anything alcohol related.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Mr. O'Keeffe said about the concept of cultural venues.  We have seen various institutions over the years drive through a coach and four, and where they get an inch they take a mile.  A theatre can offer drinks before, during and after a play and suddenly we find they are doing 21st birthday parties and 40th anniversaries.  This has to be predicated on having the seven day publican's licence.  What is important is that there is consultation before a decision and not consultation after the decision is made.  We will play a positive part in this but it is against the background of knowing there just cannot be entry into the licensed trade by a back door or a side door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I asked Mr. Cummins to switch his screen back on before he contributes.

I am Senator Carrigy from Longford.  I am the tourism representative for Fine Gael in the Seanad.  To echo the comments made by my colleague, Deputy Cannon, this is an issue that is regularly discussed by us at parliamentary party level.  I guarantee the witnesses that, as a party, we will be fully supportive of all the support measures needed.<\/p> <p>  It was said earlier that the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, was in the Seanad Chamber yesterday for a number of hours.  That gave us an opportunity to put forward some proposals that were put to us and to re-emphasise the point about the 9% VAT rate.  It is extremely important that that is extended for a number of years.  It built confidence, led to a large number of jobs being created and international visitors in the sector prior to Covid-19 and post the economic crash.  It is a successful model.  It worked ten years ago and it is something we need to put in place and commit to into the future.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Mr. Anderson's comments about the loss of experienced staff.  The numbers were stark and make it difficult for any business to reopen.  I think it was Mr. O'Keeffe who made the point that it is impossible to put a date on it but when a certain percentage of our population is vaccinated it will be safe, within health guidelines, to start to open up our economy.  That is something we need to impress on the Government, which needs to give some certainty to the industry that when a certain percentage of our population has been vaccinated we can open up within certain guidelines.<\/p> <p>  I looked up the list of people on the tourism recovery task force.  Ms Fitzgerald Kane is on it but there is no representative from the pub or restaurant industry.  I agree with the point that there should be a representative from F&aacute;ilte Ireland on it because it is not just about tourism.  It is about tourism and hospitality so we need to have representatives from the hospitality area on those organisations.<\/p> <p>  The point made that some landlords are looking to charge interest on rent arrears when people are struggling to survive is outrageous.  We need to determine if legislation can be brought in to make that practice illegal.<\/p> <p>  I totally disagree with the two-tier system in terms of opening up hospitality, on which I have spoken numerous times.  I am not be in favour of that happening next year.  There should not be any difference in terms of dry pubs, wet pubs, restaurants or hotels serving food and so on.  It created a divide within the industry which was not good.<\/p> <p>  We have not really tackled the issue of cheap alcohol.  Looking at it from the outside, our pub industry is closed yet we are allowing the large multiples sell cheap alcohol.  We made it quite easy for the younger generation to get drunk with the prices being charged.  An underground drinking culture has developed.  We have seen in the media the number of shebeens, etc., that have been set up across the country.  I feel strongly that we need to address that issue.  There were many discussions a number of years ago with regard to the minimum unit pricing Bill and it has not been introduced.  That should be introduced if we are to rebuild our hospitality sector but also for the health and well-being of a younger generation.<\/p> <p>  Those questions are for the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, and the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, members.  I spoke about this issue to the chair of my VFI in Longford, Gerry Lynn, on numerous occasions but the witnesses might give their views on it.  <\/p> <p>  On the stay and spend scheme, I agree that an amended version involving a voucher should be put in place for the period September 2021 into 2022.<\/p> <p>  The one thing that should come from this meeting is that collectively across parties we support the industry.

Like everyone else, what we have heard this afternoon is compelling and harrowing.  We all know local publicans, restaurateurs and hoteliers that have experienced upheaval in their way of life in the past 12 months.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on a few points and I will try not to repeat what others have said.  A few people talked about utilities standing charges.  I am speaking with regard to gas and electricity.  I have been dealing with a number of businesses at constituency level.  I met with Ms Fitzgerald Kane and her colleagues in the Irish Hotels Federation.  I have been doing some work on this.  In the past week I have been in contact with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and it came as somewhat of a surprise to me that it operated a scheme last year from 1 May to 31 July.  That period was the peak of the first wave of Covid-19  when pubs, and virtually everything else, were closed.  The CRU operated a temporary supply suspension scheme.  Within that scheme 200,000 electricity customers and 27,000 gas customers would have been eligible to apply for this support.  Of the 27,000 gas customers, only one in 12 availed of it, and of the 200,000 eligible electricity customers only one in 20 availed of it.  I was flabbergasted by that.  I contacted the CRU during the week to ascertain the reason this scheme was not still operating because as we have heard many businesses, pubs in particular, are now in their 13th month of closure.  It cited that it was due to lack of take-up.  I would say it was due to a lack of information because the few businesses around me at home were not aware of this scheme or were not fully aware of their eligibility.  It is shocking that, one year on, this scheme has been discontinued.<\/p> <p>  Various people told us earlier that the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the commercial rate suspensions and all of the different supports are valued yet more is needed.  There is no magic wand but it is unforgivable that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities would still not have fully grasped this problem.  I will read some figures into the record.  The utilities bill for one month of a hotel nearby me at home was &euro;9,700 and only &euro;4,500 of that related to usage.<\/p><p>That is a colossal standing charge, which is absolutely crippling.  Bearing in mind that the CRSS provides a maximum of &euro;5,000, it is unsustainable.  Could Mr. McGann explain why members of the Vintners Federation of Ireland have not fully availed of this or are they all not qualifying for it?  Perhaps he would respond to that and I will have other questions for other representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#M00900","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>Can you hear me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>Yes, we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>It is lack of information, and that is under many other headings.

There are many of us out here who are suffering.  All of us here today have used one word.  The one thing that is needed immediately for every one of us, because we are all planning to reopen in a few months, is money.  Money is what makes the world go around and it would give us an opportunity to plan our opening.  That is what the Government needs immediately, and I ask the committee to convey this to the Government.  Money is available.  We have all been short of money in this country since we were born.  Now there is money available, but it must be made available over a long period.  I suggest ten years.  Five years is the maximum if one goes to the banks.  It should come through the enterprise boards.  We are going to be almost two years without doing business and it will be five years before Covid will be eradicated and we can get back to our 2019 turnover.  Money is what is needed to get all of us off the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>There are others offering to speak, but I have other questions and we have limited time.  What Mr. McGann just said covers it all.  There is a lack of information.  He said it was criminal not to know.  Absolutely, and the audacity of the CRU in the month of March 2021, one year into Covid-19 and closure, to say that there is a lack of interest and lack of take-up is morally wrong a million times over.  When one thinks that cumulatively 227,000 business customers, not all of them, could potentially have availed of this in terms of alleviating cost burdens, that is wrong.  It is criminal.  This committee must immediately ask for the reactivation of that scheme and for a nationwide campaign to ensure hard-pressed businesses avail of a maximum discount in utilities.<\/p> <p>  I will bundle the last few questions I wish to put.  Can Ms Fitzgerald Kane tell us, briefly, if there is any pathway for weddings to resume?  Not every hotel is blessed to be on the Wild Atlantic Way or in the centre of Dublin city.  Many small town hotels rely on weddings every Saturday afternoon when 200 people arrive for receptions.  Accommodation is booked and there are meals.  The supply chain from the local butcher and local farmer is huge.  Everything depends on it.  We are a shade below peak Covid.  It is hard to conceive how this may happen over the coming weeks, but I am hoping the people in the industry might outline how the Irish Hotels Federation see a pathway to that.<\/p> <p>  I have a final question for Mr. McGann.  I believe the pub model that will be most impacted post Covid is the rural leased pub.  I will explain what I mean.  If there is a family pub that has been passed down through the generations, it does not have a mortgage.  It has overheads but the owner will eventually be able to turn a key, open up and somehow cobble together and get going again as a business.  If one is fortunate enough to be in a town or a city centre, there will be footfall owing to the location of the pub.  However, there are many pubs, and I can think of many in County Clare, in which somebody, three or four years ago, decided to take a different pathway in life.  These people leased the pub, be it at the top of the village or at the crossroads a mile from town.  They leased the pub and do not own it.  They are struggling to pay rent at this time.  I believe that is the pub that will go under.  Ultimately, that is the rural licence that will be sold, never to be seen back again.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Ms Fitzgerald Kane and Mr. McGann would respond to those two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#N00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I have to move on in order that Senator Ollie Crowe and I can contribute.

As Senator Cassells stated, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, was before the Seanad yesterday and, as a fourth generation publican, I proposed a training programme for the entire hospitality sector.  As was alluded to in earlier contributions, there will be big staff shortages when we reopen.  The Minister assured me that would happen.  To state the obvious, we must open all pubs on the same date, as well as the entire hospitality sector.  Naturally, as we move forward, we need an increase in the financial supports.  Personally, I am working with the Government in respect of the implementation of minimum unit pricing under the alcohol Bill, which is for the betterment of all our people.<\/p> <p>  Moving to insurance, I commend Noel Anderson and three other vintners across the country on taking on the might of the insurance industry and getting a successful outcome in recent weeks.  That is welcome for all business people.  We have seen the frustration of the industry and the hospitality sector at the way insurance companies have carried on over the last number of years.  With regard to the banks, to say they have been abysmal is putting it mildly.  I have contacted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Department of Finance about this issue.  The insurance reform group is working on it.  It is critical that the insurance issue is addressed, as has been outlined with regard to the costs of the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>  All of those involved in the hospitality sector have called for a roadmap to bring certainty to the current situation.  As Mr. Cribben stated, we are not looking for a date.  What we are seeking is that by the end of June 80% will be vaccinated and by the end of July in excess of 80% will have both vaccinations.

I am from a county and constituency in which pubs and restaurants are the lifeblood and heart and soul of what remains of the main streets in our towns and villages.  That is particularly so in rural parts of the constituency.  I commend the businesses that are able to operate at present in some form.  They are the businesses that can provide food.  I have seen it in Bailieborough where Bailie Hotel has rallied to find a new way of doing things by being able to provide a takeaway service for food.  Everybody is sick of cooking at this stage.  However, I feel sorry for the businesses beside them that are closed because they do not provide food or because the business is a non-food pub.  That has been massively divisive and has done a great disservice to towns and villages throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. McGann.<\/p><p>I have had the lovely experience of being in his lovely village pub in Monivea, County Galway.  Like a lot of villages across the country they do far more than just provide a service.  They provide a social amenity where people can meet up, an amenity that has been absolutely wiped out.  Many businesses are run on pride, having been passed on from generation to generation, without ever having been sustainable even before the pandemic happened.  Those people and families had felt a real commitment to their communities to stay open and to provide that social amenity for people to meet up.  The villages' banks are gone, the post offices are gone or the local shop is gone.<\/p><p> On the businesses that have been run as a civic duty to communities and which may not have been sustainable in the first place, have we an idea about how the long period of being closed may have provided an opportunity for people to get out of those businesses?  Have we an idea as to the number of pubs that will not reopen?<\/p><p> I thank our guests for being here.

This is something that we must raise with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to make it more attractive to business people.

I would say that 30% of rural pubs in Ireland are not sustainable.  They are giving a service to their community.  They do not have their doors opened.  The committee may be aware that many pubs did not open their doors until 2 p.m., 5 p.m., or like myself 7 p.m.  The pubs are giving a service to the community.  As was said earlier, a lot of the other services are closed.  This is their pride and passion.  To close that door would be like going into the grave.  This may take a few months or six months but I believe it will take a year before we realise how many will close.  This is the reason a lot of them are not closing.  It is their passion and it is about keeping that door open.  They would feel so bad about it.  It is because of the three or four generations before them.  There is nothing left in rural Ireland for it to be a sustainable business.  As we know, many places opened takeaways, which I did also, to keep the business going and to give a service to the community.  The other services are not in small communities and they have not been supported by any Government in the past ten years.  The way small rural pubs are at the moment is a very sad state of affairs and especially going forward with regard to rearing a family or anything like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1616457600,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#O00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for listening to our concerns here today.  We look forward to welcoming the committee and the people of Ireland back into our premises, pubs, restaurants and hotels, once public health safety allows us to do so.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about apprenticeships.  It is very important that a hospitality and tourism skills directorate be set up to co-ordinate all skills for our industry.  This can be either a unit within SOLAS or it could be a reconstituted CERT, such as we had in the past, or some equivalent.  We need one organisation to be in charge of tourism and hospitality training.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of insurance, we must drag every insurance company into the courts to get them to pay what they have to pay out on business interruption claims.  This is totally unfair.  The Central Bank is not doing what it should be doing on this matter.  We have had numerous meetings with the Central Bank and we feel that it must explain why insurance companies are not paying out on business interruption claims.  Businesses are having to go to court to get what is right for them.<\/p> <p>  Thousands of employees and businesses in our industry are tuning in to this committee today.  They need hope, they need a roadmap, and they need to know they will have a job or a business to go back to some time this summer.

Many people did apply but the businesses were turned down.  Many of our members live over the business but if one was living over the pub, one did not qualify and quite a number were turned down because of that.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and the committee for giving us this opportunity.  I hope that we have been able to demonstrate that the two things this industry is short of are cash and hope.  Cash is always hard to come by.  Hope is somewhat easier in the context of what we are looking for in respect of a roadmap.  I ask the committee, in its report, to impress upon the Government the immediate need in this regard.  Some time next week, we are going to get the next tranche of what the Government's thinking is on reopening the economy.  I do not believe it is good enough to just look at what is going to happen in April.  The Government must look beyond that to what will happen for the rest of the year, adding in the criteria to which Senator Byrne alluded, that this will not be a guarantee or certainty and that there may be caveats.  I thank the members for giving us the opportunity and we look forward to seeing the committee's report and support for the issues we raised today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021032300002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1616457600,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>Some 270,000 people, whole livelihoods and whole communities are dependent on tourism and hospitality.  We have delivered before.  We were the number one creator in the aftermath of the last financial crisis, although it was a very different crisis.  The supports are critical now but as the hope of reopening is being pushed out, there is a need to increase those supports.  Equally, while we have been assured of no cliff edge, we need a sense that these measures will be in place until the end of March 2022.  This is what it will take to actually get back to walking on our feet; not running.<\/p> <p>  The biggest measure of success now is to bring 270,000 people back to work sustainably.  We have the legacy from last year.  The outlook is so poor and there is such little hope.  These are the words that have been used a few times.  It is the hopes of people around staycations, the hopes of wedding couples, and it is the 270,000 people in our industry.  I want to reaffirm that what is needed is commitment around supports, a sense of confidence from the Government, the commitment to the vaccination programme and a sustainable roadmap built on engagement that recognises the scale of decimation.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for all of its efforts and for its continued support.
