This did not happen because the Government simply does not get it.  T&aacute; an pac&aacute;iste costais mhaireacht&aacute;la a d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair an Taoiseach an tseachtain seo caite i bhfad r&oacute;-bheag, i bhfad r&oacute;-dh&eacute;anach.  Is ar &eacute;igean go bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; difr&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh.<\/p><p>At the weekend, I asked people to share their cost of living stories with me.  In a matter of hours, I received almost 1,000 replies.  These are stories of extortionate rent, of cold homes, of struggling to put food on the table and fuel in the car, and of unaffordable insurance and childcare.  These are stories of hardship and worry, which are pushing families to the edge.  I will share some of these stories with the Taoiseach.  Kieran wrote to me stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have respectable jobs.  [but] Our apartment is an ice box- we have to choose between food and my daughter's medicine or heat.  Our daughter...wear[s] 2 pairs of PJ's [pyjamas] during the day and 2 at night while covered in 2 [or] 3 blankets to keep warm.  We can't afford childcare so my parents babysit.  It's impossible to get on the housing market.  I feel guilty every night. <\/blockquote>  <p>Barbara said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have nothing left.  I can't buy the same amount of food I used to buy.  I buy the cheapest meat.  I just hope that nothing breaks down like my car or...[my] washing machine. <\/blockquote>  <p>Amy told me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe work full time.  We're struggling to put oil in our tank and diesel in [the] car.  [We] pay insurance that is colossal, feed ourselves and keep things going.  There&rsquo;s only ... two of us [but] I can't imagine what it would cost if we had kids. <\/blockquote>  <p>Janice told us:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&euro;950 in rent for [a] one bedroom ... spending &euro;40-50 a week [on] petrol.  &euro;2000 [on] insurance.  Bills haven't arrived yet for 2022 but I'm really scared. <\/blockquote>  <p>Robert told me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI'm getting electricity bills at 240-260 euro and rent of &euro;1,100 for a damp 1-bed apartment.  Something needs to be done.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <p>Eamonn said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAfter paying utility bills, it is then a toss-up between food and rent.  I had to request ... help from the ...Vincent De Paul to get some food.  I'm feeling so lost. <\/blockquote>  <p>Caoimhe says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI&rsquo;m a 26-year-old teacher.  This year I have found it so tough...[just] to keep myself afloat.  My cost of living is nearly one whole pay check.  My question to ... government is when will it change?  I&rsquo;m working to survive not [to] live. <\/blockquote>  <p>Finally, Anna said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy ESB bill was near[ly] &euro;400.  The Government credit isn't worth the paper it's printed on.  What about the cost of my petrol?  My rent?  This government has left me behind. <\/blockquote>  <p>These stories are just a glimpse of what people face.  The package announced last week offered only the bare minimum and it will not make a dent for people.  It is very clear that the Government needs to do much more but yesterday, the Taoiseach said there would not be any further interventions until the next budget.  He shows no urgency but instead dithers and delays.  The Taoiseach cannot seriously suggest that those who are struggling to pay their bills today must wait until October when the Government might possibly intervene.  The house is on fire now.  Workers and families cannot wait seven months for a fire brigade that might never come.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500003#A00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1644933600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which is a very serious one for many people throughout the country.<\/p> <p>We know that inflation has risen very significantly globally.  The origins of this are fundamentally global both in terms of oil and gas prices which have risen dramatically across the world - the Deputy will have to acknowledge that - and the unevenness between the supply of products and the demand that rose dramatically as a result of societies and economies reopening and emerging from Covid-19.  This is true all across Europe.  Ireland has not escaped that global phenomenon of inflation.  <\/p> <p> In the budget we allocated over &euro;1 billion between tax and social protection measures to help to cushion people in respect of increases in terms of the cost of living, including a &euro;5 increase in the weekly welfare rates; a &euro;5 per week increase in the fuel allowance; a &euro;3 per week increase in the living alone allowance; a &euro;630 million package of income tax and USC reductions and parents' benefits increasing from five to seven weeks from July.  In addition to that, the measure we announced last week was for over &euro;500 million, which will result in cutting electricity bills by &euro;200.  In regard to the fuel allowance, there is an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 and the threshold for the drug payment scheme is being reduced from &euro;100 to &euro;80.  The Deputy mentioned that Kieran was worried about the cost of medicines and so on.  That measure was deliberately targeted at families with significant medical bills.  We have reduced that significantly over the past while.  There is also a front-loading of the working family payment; a 20% reduction in public transport costs and fares, which will affect and help about 800,000 people who use public transport to get to work and so forth and a reduction in caps for school transport fees for the next academic year.<\/p> <p> The Deputy is saying that is too little.  Hence, I have to say what she seems to be proposing would be inflationary.  The measures the Deputy is advocating would make things worse.  On housing, in the budget we have allocated very substantial funds for house construction.  We accept that we need to build far more homes and far more apartments than we currently are building.  The good news is that throughout 2021 there were 30,000 commencements, the highest since 2008.  I would again appeal to Deputies to allow projects to get off the ground.  Supply is essential to deal with the housing crisis.  Supply is essential to get rents stabilised and reduced.  If we do not get up to 33,000 per annum built over the next year number of years, rents will not stabilise and will not come down.  People who are objecting left, right and centre to housing developments are not going to help renters.  They are not going to help people who are paying too high a rent at this time.  <\/p> <p> On childcare, the Government is committed to the sector.  In the most recent budget, we put a significant allocation of funding towards childcare, to improve the pay and conditions for people working in the childcare sector and to create career pathways.  Housing and childcare are two big cost items.  We want to go further in the next budget in terms of access and affordability around childcare and we are going to do that.  We must also acknowledge that this economy has rebounded very significantly because of good and sound economic management.  I am not sure the Deputy acknowledges that.  We are near to being back to full employment much earlier than anticipated.  Ireland is one of the fastest growing economies across the European Union, with many people securing jobs much earlier after we emerged from the pandemic than would originally have been anticipated.  That should be acknowledged as well.  <\/p> <p> The Government supports in terms of supporting wages, supporting businesses to keep people employed and the pandemic unemployment payment represent unprecedented intervention by Government in the economy over the past two years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500003#A00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644933900,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I shared stories with the Taoiseach, real lived experiences in the here and now.

We want to work with people, trade unions and employers to navigate our way through this pandemic-generated inflationary cycle and to do it in an intelligent way that protects people's basic cost of living and jobs.

I was part of the team that spent 11 months writing Sl&aacute;intecare.  An extraordinary series of leaks was reported in the <i>Business Post<\/i>, revealing a dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and the HSE.  That leads me to believe we are further away than we have ever been from the single-tier public health service we desire.  To be frank, the commentary in the meeting that was the subject of the leak was quite derogatory from a relationship point of view as regards how we are ever going to achieve the service we want.  The relationship between the HSE and the Department of Health is obviously going to be damaged.  I believe I can vouch that this is the case.<\/p><p>Also worrying is how that will impact on the real lives of people.  Officials in the Department of Health are saying that the idea we will recruit 10,000 people this year is, and I apologise in advance for the language used by one of the officials, &quot;batshit&quot;.  That is what those officials think about the recruitment of 10,000 people we need for our health service.  There were many other similar comments.  This was the type of meeting that was going on in the Department of Health relating to the necessary recruitment in our health service.  What does that say about the Department of Health?  What does it say about the Minister for Health and how the Department is being run?  In fairness to the two junior Ministers who were on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; the past two mornings, they tried to give some account of it but the Minister for Health is accountable.  This comes after some terrible information emerging regarding the recruitment of a consultant psychiatrist in south Kerry.  We know that 700 consultant posts are vacant.  We know from Simon Carswell in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>about the shortage of GPs across the country.  One in five GPs is expected to retire by the end of the decade.  We need 2,000 more.  In 13 GP areas, medical cardholders have been without a permanent doctor for over a year.  There are 26 vacancies on General Medical Services, GMS, panels, covering 17,000 patients.  It goes on and on.  Many of us know of towns across Ireland that have no GP.  We have an opportunity post Covid to put in place what we need and desire, that is, a single-tier public health service.  The long-term health impacts of a lack of continuity of care and the difficulty of getting an appointment will cause even more waiting lists and issues.<\/p> <p>Evidence from the UK shows that earlier intervention and having extra GPs per head of population saves people from acute and chronic illnesses.<\/p> <p> We have a huge problem.  We know that there are issues in respect of the relationship between the Department of Health and the HSE.  I want to ask the Taoiseach quite clearly on the floor of the D&aacute;il of he believes that we will recruit the necessary 10,000 staff for our health services this year.

That is a very basic right and entitlement of people.  In terms of the relationship between the Department of Health and the HSE, the Minister holds biweekly meetings with the CEO of the HSE, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the chairman of the HSE board.  The Comptroller and Auditor General audits and signs off on the accounts of the HSE.  That is how it operates.<\/p>  <p>  More fundamentally, we need to stand back and observe that over the past two years there was record recruitment to the health service.  The net figure was 12,500 people.  More than 32,000 or 33,000 people gross were recruited.  To just stand still, the HSE must recruit 9,500 people every year because of 9,500 people going in different directions and into different careers.  That is an extraordinary level of recruitment.  The net gain of 12,500 over two years is a record high number of recruitments.  Add to that the 4,000 who were recruited as test-and-trace staff and for the vaccination team.  A great deal of work went in there.  There are 132,000 people now working in the HSE and our health service.<\/p>  <p>  If we stand back from all that, in the past 30 years and 20 years in particular, we have witnessed very dramatic improvements in health outcomes, with major gains in longevity and lifespan.  I say that because people need to realise that our investment in health services is delivering dividends, be it in the context of stroke, cardiovascular or cancer strategies.  Survival rates in all those key areas have improved significantly over two to three decades.  That must be acknowledged in all our commentary on the health service. The health service will always create, understandably and deservedly, issues of concern, given the enormity of it and the proportion of the population it covers.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I am still impatient for reform and progress.  An integrated financial management system is required and needed in the HSE.  That is absolutely the case.  When I became Taoiseach, I told the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister that we need to modernise the information technology systems in the area of health in the context of the delivery of healthcare services.  I refer in this regard to unique patient identifiers and so forth.  Covid-19 intervened and, irrespective of what Deputy Kelly says, the HSE and health service rose to the challenge and developed a vaccination programme that is without question one of the best in Europe or the world.

Can he seriously suggest that is the case?  Average heating and energy costs are due to go up by about &euro;800 a year.  The Government is giving people back &euro;200 a year and a little bit extra on the fuel allowance.  Who is supposed to pay the rest for workers whose wages are increasing at maybe 1%, for public sector workers, or for pensioners and social welfare recipients who got an extra fiver in the budget?  Who is supposed to pay the rest?<\/p><p>What about rents?  There is absolutely nothing on that in the measures.  Rents are up 10% year-on-year according to <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  Average rents in Dublin for a one-bedroom property are now &euro;1,500, with the average for a two-bedroom property at &euro;2,000.  People would need between &euro;17,000 and &euro;24,000 in income just to pay the rent.  There is nothing to deal with the unaffordable situation in rents.  Then we have the wider cost of living, including food etc which is up by at least 5.7% and probably more.  Where are workers supposed to make up the difference?  Can the Taoiseach honestly it is enough?  It is an absolute insult.<\/p><p>Yesterday, in an interview, the Taoiseach ruled out another possibility.  We proposed last week that there be rent controls, caps on energy prices and the bringing up of wages.  He is not willing to do any of those things to control the spiralling cost of living.  He said yesterday that we cannot rid of the universal social charge, USC, because it would be too expensive to do so.  Of course, that is not what Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il were saying before the election in 2016, when the now Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said, as part of pre-election promises, the USC would be gone for everybody earning less than &euro;80,000 within five years.<\/p> <p>Paudie Coffey, who was Minister of State at the time, said in a press release and a Fine Gael manifesto that his party would get rid of the USC altogether.  All of that is gone now; too expensive, apparently.  As a result, we cannot give workers a break by getting rid of the USC.  My question to the Taoiseach is if he honestly believes this is adequate?  How are people supposed to pay their unaffordable rents or come up with the hundreds of euros extra in heating and energy costs if the Government rules out all of these things?  Why is it that it is always alright for the workers to pay?  They can afford it, but the Taoiseach says that we cannot afford to give them a break on the USC, that we cannot afford rent controls or that we cannot afford the energy price hikes, even though landlords-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500007#E02700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644936000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Time is up, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500008#F00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644936000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>----energy companies and corporations are making an absolute fortune at the same time that workers are being hammered as a result of the cost of living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500008#F00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1644936000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We provided &euro;650 million in the budget to reduce the USC and tax, a move which the Deputy opposed.

That is a 54-month waiting list for respiratory appointments and we are about to face into a potential avalanche of respiratory cases as a result of long Covid.  According to research by the Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service, which I commissioned, an estimated 114,500 people and rising in Ireland have long Covid.  It is rapidly becoming a hidden iceberg of long-term chronic illness for our struggling health service.  In December, analysis from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland showed that the shortfall in cancer diagnoses equates to a delayed diagnosis for invasive cancers of between seven and ten every day in 2020 alone.  That is someone's mother, father, wife, husband, sister, brother, daughter or son.  Last year, while still dealing with Covid, the HSE had to grapple with the cyberattack.  On top of that, GP attendances are also down significantly due to a mixture of reasons, including cost, private patients unable to access any GP and those lucky enough to have a GP finding it difficult to get appointments.  All these delays are leading to cancer being diagnosed at a later stage of the disease, when treatment options are limited and, tragically, the prognosis is poor.  We urgently need to do things differently if we are to address these appalling waiting lists once and for all.  There is no doubt that recruitment of staff is key but we have already seen from the Department of Health disclosure on Sunday, which was subsequently backed up by the HSE's chief executive, that we will be at least 4,500 staff short in the health service recruitment drive this year.<\/p> <p>I accept that we cannot magically make staff appear but we could sponsor students in training today on the basis that they commit to working within the health service for a period after graduating.<\/p> <p> Second, we need to look at the way the health system works now and how we can speed it up.  For example, we could maximise the use of the existing health infrastructure by extending the operational hours so that we get more scans done on the same machine, including on Saturdays and Sundays, as well as using the spare diagnostic capacity within our smaller hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500009#G02300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644937200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>First, I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this very important issue.  I also thank the Deputy for the research that he has commissioned.  It is an interesting analysis, maybe I would suggest a preliminary analysis, in respect of long Covid that certainly will be part and parcel of the health service for quite some time to come and will be a significant challenge for clinicians for some time to come.  It needs to be monitored.  Steps are being taken also, from a research perspective, to analyse and monitor this rigorously to make sure that we can look after people and also see the more medium to long-term impacts of Covid-19 on a certain cohort of people.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of waiting lists more generally, they were too long before Covid-19.  That is the first point.  The base was high coming into Covid-19.  They have got worse because of Covid-1 and the two lockdowns in particular - the first lockdown in 2020 and the second lockdown because of the Alpha variant in 2021.  The short-term plan in the autumn worked well - it reduced waiting lists by approximately 6% - but, unfortunately, then we had the restrictions coming into the end of December and January where the health service and hospitals were told to focus almost exclusively on Covid and the Omicron issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will shortly be announcing and bringing to Government a waiting list initiative for 2022, but coupled with that a multi-annual waiting list initiative in terms of getting those waiting times and the numbers on the lists significantly down from outpatient to inpatient to day case, including, of course, diagnostics etc.  That needs a comprehensive plan.  The overall sum of money is approximately &euro;350 million.  That will be made available in 2022 to deal with the waiting lists, including, obviously, the public health system, the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the utilisation of private sector capacity in an all-out effort to get these lists significantly down.  Emerging from Covid, this is a key target and challenge.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct also to identify room for efficiencies, particularly the utilisation of equipment and facilities over the weekend period etc.  Every available opportunity to do that will be taken in the context of this plan.  The task force is jointly chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health with the chief executive officer of the HSE, and with the senior HSE team on that task force as well with other key officials to make sure that there is a relentless focus on getting the waiting times and the waiting lists down because it is important in terms of people's individual health and the overall health of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500010#H00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1644937200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I am not disputing that the Government is spending money - this year we will spend &euro;40,000 every single minute on the health service - but just throwing money at our waiting lists does not work within the health service.  We need to see structural reform.  For example, take the rapid access haematuria clinic - the blood and urine clinic - at Roscommon University Hospital, where 10% of referred patients have been diagnosed with cancer.  It treats 70% of patients in one visit and 100% of patients are seen within the 28-day target time for urgent cases, yet this service has not been rolled out anywhere else.  There are many cases of good practice in the health service but these never get main-streamed because it clashes with someone else's agenda.

The Rural Independents believe this to be crucial given that Project Ireland 2040, which is a composite of theand the , is the long-term overarching strategy to change how investment is made in public infrastructure.  The Bill aims to give the D&aacute;il an important input into the roll-out and delivery of Project Ireland 2040.  From a policy and democratic standpoint, we believe that a policy which effectively dictates where people live, work, play and have access to all public services over the next 20 years is deserving of rigorous and honest scrutiny by this D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>In short, the Bill represents the only way possible to ensure democratic accountability for Project Ireland 2040 objectives can be obtained.  The Bill has been carefully drafted in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor and has been cleared by the Bills Office and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.<b><\/b>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his team and staff of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor.<\/p><p>The underlying objective of the Bill is to compel the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to prepare annually and lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report on the progress made in implementing Project Ireland 2040, the constituent components of which are the national planning framework and the national development plan.<\/p> <p>The Bill seeks to improve transparency and accountability over the decisions, roll-out and delivery of Project Ireland 2040 to ensure that rural communities are not being left behind when it comes to the delivery of key infrastructural project and public services critical to their areas.  The Bill also paves the way for an annual debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that would allow Deputies to scrutinise and evaluate progress or otherwise.  It also allows for democratic accountability over the Executive, including the Government and unelected officials, and the far-reaching policy objectives and funding allocations contained within Project Ireland 2040.  We do not have any input and are shut out at present.<\/p> <p> The Bill would effectively give D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a much greater input into rural and regional development.  As matters stand, the D&aacute;il has been completely sidelined when it comes to Project Ireland 2040, which means the people have been denied democratic input into the plan and its funding channels via their elected Deputies.  That is surely not right.  The Bill also places Project Ireland 2040 and its constituent components, the national planning framework and the national development plan, on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p> Why is this Bill important now?  There is an infrastructural gap and an urban-rural divide.  It is predicted that by 2040, circa 1 million more people will be living in Ireland.  This population growth will require hundreds of thousands of new jobs and homes, more cultural and social amenities, better regional connectivity and improved environmental sustainability.  The national development plan sets out the strategic investment plan to achieve this.  The Rural Independent Group is bringing forward this Bill in light of the sheer significance of this plan and the need to allow the D&aacute;il and the public to have a meaningful input into these investment decisions on an annual basis.  The annual level of capital expenditure in Ireland is currently just below &euro;10 billion per annum, which is tracking the level of planned spending set out in Project Ireland 2040.  However, there is still a large infrastructure gap in Ireland across a majority of sectors, including health, education, housing, public transport and infrastructure.  In addition, rural Ireland is suffering from many years of chronic underinvestment.  This requires significant capital investment in areas such as roads, public transport, broadband, energy, built environment, including water and sewerage schemes, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  It also requires a commitment to facilitate local young people to build a home on their land in order to help stem rural depopulation.  Importantly, the projects the Government is currently investing in under this plan will last for more than 50 years.  We should be thinking of young people and the lives ahead of them.  The plan offers a significant opportunity for a connected and integrated infrastructure that puts a focus on communities and creates a sustainable way of living and working in all parts of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500016#Q02100","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644940500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500017#R00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644940500,"counter":189,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500017#R00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644940500,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1644940500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500017#R00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644940500,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500017#R00600","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644940500,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Minimum Wage (Equal Pay for Young Workers) Bill 2022: First Stage","time":1644940500,"counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500017#R00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1644940500,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to remove the lower minimum wage rates imposed on those employed between the ages of 16 and 20. <\/blockquote>  <p>I am happy to introduce the National Minimum Wage (Equal Pay for Young Workers) Bill.  I thank those in my office, in particular Ms Nicole McCarthy, for their work on the Bill.  I also thank the Bills Office for its assistance.<\/p><p>Last week, the D&aacute;il unanimously voted to condemn the lower rate of the minimum wage for those under 20 as &quot;flagrant discrimination against young people&quot;.  Not a single person in the D&aacute;il voted against that motion.  It is the view of the D&aacute;il that having people under the age of 20 on less than the minimum wage is flagrant discrimination.  That is why we in People Before Profit are introducing a Bill to end that discrimination once and for all and to ensure equal rights for young workers.<\/p><p>It is illegal to discriminate based on age, under equality legislation, yet the minimum wage laws make it legal to do so in that area.  Those under the age of 20 are blatantly discriminated against, receiving only 90%, 80% or 70% of the minimum wage.  Those who are under 17 can earn as little as 70% of the minimum wage, which amounts to &euro;7.35 an hour, when the minimum wage stands at &euro;10.50.  We know that the minimum wage of &euro;10.50 is a poverty wage.  Someone earning that wage full time is beneath the poverty line and yet the law states that it is okay for people to be paid even less than that, not on the basis that they do any less work but simply because they are younger.  The kind of spin that is used to justify this was heard from the T&aacute;naiste in 2018 when he stated: &quot;Sometimes people go abroad for a period and earn money.  Others get money from their parents.  Lots of us did.&quot;  In other words, the assumption is that people are relying on the so-called bank of mum and dad.  However, that is not the case for very many young people in this country.  It is not the case that this is just pocket money on the side; money that people do not need.  There are people who are struggling to pay mortgages and to feed their families, never mind the massive cost of living crisis at the moment.<\/p><p>The Government is assuming that those under the age of 20 are getting some kind of cut in their rent or living costs due to being underage.  If people go to their landlords and tell them they are only 18 years of age and, therefore, should only be paying 80% of the rent, the landlord will not be very receptive to that argument.  Such people are working to try to cover their bills and rent, and they deserve a proper wage.<\/p><p>I got a message from a 16-year-old who described his experience.  He described the lower rate he is receiving as crucifying and insulting.  He said that he goes home from school and switches from school uniform to work uniform and goes back out the door again, only to earn less than his co-workers.  He said that in 2022, this is insulting, discriminatory and, truthfully, not worth working for.  He is earning &euro;7.35 an hour and wants to be treated the same as every other worker.  Can anyone really argue that it was fair to have young workers stacking shelves and keeping shops open during the pandemic, being recognised as essential workers, and yet getting paid as little as &euro;7.35 an hour?  That has been the reality of those workers under the age of 18.<\/p><p>We know from the latest Central Statistics Office figures that more than 10,000 workers in this country are earning rates less than the minimum wage as a result of being 19 or under.  Some of these workers have been recognised as essential in sectors such as retail, accommodation, restaurants and the service industry.  For those renting, we know the most recent <i>daft.ie <\/i>report suggested rents increased by 10.3% in the past year.  How on earth are young people expected to afford that when it is clearly a struggle and is unaffordable for those who are on 100% of the minimum wage rate?  We need action to end the flagrant discrimination against workers under the age of 20 and this Bill will do precisely that.  It will allow workers of all ages to receive at least the minimum wage, as is fair and right.<\/p><p>This is a Bill to end discrimination, which is in the interests of all workers.  It is not in the interests of any worker that a boss can employ someone for even less than the minimum wage.  That is used to drive down terms and conditions for all.  For us, of course, this is not linked to being satisfied with the &euro;10.50 minimum wage.  We are not satisfied with that amount.  The D&aacute;il unanimously passed a motion last week which stated there must be an emergency review of the minimum wage and an increase by May.  We brought forward that motion.  We will hold the Government to that and will be fighting for a significant increase in the minimum wage.  Germany recently announced plans for a &euro;12 minimum wage.  In many states in the US, workers have won a minimum wage of $15 an hour.  We are fighting for a &euro;15 an hour minimum wage for all in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500017#R00900","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1644940500,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Is

Social dialogue between Government, trade unions and other representative groups takes place through structures like the national economic dialogue, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council and many sectoral groups and with Ministers and Departments directly.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have had a number of engagements with social partners in a variety of different formats.  This includes through mechanisms such as the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, which brings together representatives of employers and trade unions with Ministers to exchange views on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market and which are of mutual concern.  LEEF, which I chair, has met regularly to facilitate discussions on ongoing issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic and our economic recovery.  The most recent meeting of LEEF took place on 3 February 2022 and discussions included Covid-19, economic outlook including inflation and the work of the LEEF subgroups.<\/p>  <p>  Under the auspices of LEEF, there has been significant progress on issues such as the introduction of statutory sick pay, work place safety during Covid-19 and the establishment of a high level review of collective bargaining.  In addition to Government representation, the membership of LEEF is made up of a labour delegation led by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and an employer delegation led by IBEC, which includes the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and Chambers Ireland.  This has been the case since the  formation of LEEF in 2016 and reflects long-standing and established arrangements for engagement between Government, employers and trade unions on labour market issues.<\/p>  <p>  LEEF is also just one of a wide range of engagement mechanisms which allow stakeholders make their views known to Government.  There are many other national and sectoral business and employer organisations involved in other fora.  Other engagements I have had with social partners include a series of meetings last year with representatives from the environmental pillar, community and voluntary pillar and farming and agriculture pillar to discuss how social dialogue can be strengthened as well as issues of concern to those sectors.  I also met with those representing the fishing sector.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing my engagements with the social partners in the period ahead as we continue to strengthen social dialogue and work collaboratively to tackle major challenges facing the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500018#S02050","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1644941100,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The cost of living is the dominant political issue at present.

Does the Taoiseach agree with workers seeking pay rises?  The committee also sought to change the small benefits exemption rule to increase the limit from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 for those earning up to &euro;1,462 per week and for the values to be spread over multiple payments, for example, &euro;100 per month.

This is a deal that 84% of the workers rejected before Christmas.  The company is making them vote again and said it will outsource 100% of the operations if the workers do not accept this.  That is outrageous.  Aer Lingus is a company that went into Covid-19 with cash reserves of &euro;900 million.  Its cargo operations saw a significant increase in profitability even during the pandemic.  Now, it is trying to impose pay cuts and tear up contracts and agreements with workers and drive their pay down.

These are essential workers who helped to keep our supermarkets open during Covid-19.  Their work became a lot more stressful and difficult during that period.  They are in their third year without a pay rise.  Last week, instead of Tesco contacting them to offer them the pay rise they deserve after all the hard work they have done, it contacted them and stated that their jobs are being outsourced.  They have a few weeks to decide and then they will either get a severance package or be transferred over to a private company, namely, OCS, where pay, conditions and terms firms will inevitably be downgraded.<\/p>  <p>  The workers are outraged.  I met with a number of them last week.  They said there was no discussion with them whatsoever and that Tesco was simply attempting to ram through this outsourcing agenda.

They proved that, particularly during the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education committed to placing secretaries on a public service incremental pay scale and give them a pay increase.  In October 2020, the T&aacute;naiste committed to regularising the employment terms and conditions and pension rates of school secretaries but they have been kept in limbo.  There are two issues, one of which is with regard to where they are on the payroll and whether it is with the school or the Department.  The other relates to the need for them to sign on during the summer months.  It is the position of the Department and, therefore, the Government that they should sign on during the summer; not that this is the current situation but that it should be part of the offering.  I do not believe that is at all acceptable.  I hope the Taoiseach will agree it is not acceptable that as part of ensuring that we get school secretaries and caretakers decent paying conditions, they would have to sign on during the summer.

I am thinking in particular at this time, unfortunately, of the very serious crisis in the pig meat sector.  This sector is suffering huge losses at present, which threatens the viability of some pig units and farms throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  A number of factors are contributing to these difficulties.  First, during Covid-19, there were staff shortages, which led to backlog in processing.  Brexit has impacted very severely the value and volume of pig meat exports to Britain, which is our most valued and valuable market.  Exports are down 50% since the beginning of last year.  There is input price inflation and, of course, pig units are one of the highest users of direct energy in Irish agriculture.  There are also other increased input costs.<\/p> <p>The sector is worth &euro;1 billion to the economy on an annual basis and is the third-largest sector within agriculture.  The Netherlands, France, Belgium, Poland and Slovenia have introduced direct aid to pig producers and for the sector.  We need the same level of direct aid to the sector immediately or there will be casualties and huge losses incurred by it, which will threaten the viability of many units.

I met with representatives of the industry last week who are extremely concerned that the relevant Department has issued a template for the securing of those licences that is unworkable, impractical and will not allow the issuing of licences for harvesting in 2022.  Continuing with the importation of peat in this country is a farcical situation, it is environmentally unfriendly and it will be an economic disaster for the horticulture industry.  The mushroom industry, in particular, cannot afford it.  The cost base is not there and it cannot carry the cost of importation of peat.

Suffice to say that the Government allocated approximately &euro;1 billion in the most recent budget towards cost of living issues, from taxation relief of some &euro;630 million to more than &euro;500 million in respect of social protection measures.  That was added to last week by a package of more than &euro;500 million, which included cutting electricity bills by &euro;200 and an increased fuel allowance payment of &euro;125.  That is on top of the &euro;5 increase in fuel allowance, extended eligibility and extension of the season that were introduced in the budget.  The drug payment scheme threshold has been reduced to &euro;80, there is a front-loading of the working family payment, a 20% reduction in public transport from the end of April until the end of the year, which will help some 800,000 people who are currently using the services, and a reduction in caps for school transport fees for the next academic year.  The package is not a sticking plaster.  It is an effort on top of what was done in the budget to help people to get over the cost of living issue in terms of the inflationary cycle we are currently experiencing.  We have to work with Europe, the European Central Bank and others in weathering this storm and navigating our way through it to ensure we do not undermine our economy and that we keep it on the track it is on at the moment, which is one of extraordinary growth and development and increased employment.<\/p><p>The remote working proposals are going through the pre-legislative scrutiny process and we will take on board people's input to that process.  The T&aacute;naiste will review the Bill once it gets through pre-legislative scrutiny.  There is a balancing required in this and quite considerable work yet to be done on it.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, regarding any specific employment, we have a voluntarist system.  We have the WRC and the Labour Court.  There are mechanisms for workers' representatives to pursue issues.  I would say to Aer Lingus that it should respect its staff, many of whom have given long service.  The Government intervened and gave assistance to the company for two reasons: one, to protect workers and their jobs; and, two, because, let us be honest, aviation took an awful and extraordinary hit during the pandemic that went to the very core of viability, all over the world, of airlines, airports and so forth.  There was a need to underpin and keep that which is essential to Ireland's connectivity because that connectivity is key to jobs, the economy and exports.  We have had record exports from this country announced today, again because of our connectivity and the infrastructure around that connectivity.<\/p><p>The same applies to the situation at Tesco, which was raised by a number of Deputies.  Again, there are labour relations mechanisms there for having these issued resolved.  Workers' rights should be respected in regard to their entitlements to pensions, pay and conditions in any such transfers and there should be proper negotiation processes in that regard.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised the situation of school secretaries, which I dealt with earlier today on the Order of Business.  There has been a lot of progress made in the discussions at the WRC.  There was significant progress following discussions on 13 September last year.  Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department of Education has offered to move school secretaries' pay rates to a scale that is aligned with the clerical officer grade 3 pay scale on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis, according to secretaries' current working pattern.  The Department has also offered to improve the conditions with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement.  The talks continued most recently at a meeting of the WRC on 26 January and the parties are to meet again later this month following reflection on matters discussed.<\/p><p>I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Flaherty.  It is a very important piece of information that &euro;6 million has already been spent on the Mullingar to Longford road.

I will talk again to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.

I also had the opportunity to speak to him in person last November in the margins of the world leaders summit at COP26, when he reaffirmed his full commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  I expressed my appreciation for the strong position he has taken in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Last September, I participated remotely in the global vaccine summit that was hosted by President Biden at an event that coincided with the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  I also participated in the virtual summit for democracy that was hosted by President Biden in December.  I look forward to continuing to work co-operatively and closely with the Biden administration, as well as with representatives of both parties in Congress, to deepen Irish-American relations, to strengthen European Union-US relations, to co-operate on global challenges and to support to many Irish people who have made a home in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  It was also a pleasure to welcome the new United States Ambassador to Ireland, Claire Cronin, and her family to Government Buildings on 10 February.  I wish her every success during her time in Ireland.  As the House will be aware, it was not possible last year to celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in the traditional way, with most events moving online.  I am hopeful that in the change to more positive circumstances in which we now find ourselves, it will prove possible to return to more in-person events this year.<\/p>  <p>  St. Patrick's Day is an important opportunity for us as a country to renew and celebrate our connections around the world.  On 8 February, the Government announced our hope to undertake an increased programme of events around the world, where public health considerations allow.  For my part, I hope it will be possible to resume at least some of the events in Washington DC that have traditionally marked St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500020#U01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1644942300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I think we are all glad to see some signs of de-escalation over the Ukraine, with Russia withdrawing some troops from the Ukrainian border.

There are well-worn international mechanisms for such dialogue, particularly in respect of the overall security architecture in Europe.

Perhaps the Deputy should talk to some of the Baltic countries, countries like Poland and other countries that feel they need a presence given their history.  They do not feel secure and that is just the honest position.  If you talk to people in many of the eastern bloc countries that became democratic and joined European Union, they are very fearful and feel vulnerable.

I pay tribute to President Macron for the work he has been doing and to the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who is engaging and talking through the issues.  With those kinds of talks they are hopefully facilitating a de-escalation on the Russian side.

We will hopefully get the opportunity to discuss with President Biden the situation in relation to Northern Ireland, the peace process more generally and the protocol.  That is very important.  We have a good relationship with the President and with Congress and we have maintained that.  They and the President's office have been well briefed on the legacy issues, the proposals from the UK Government in respect of an amnesty and our position on that.  The European dimension and the US-Europe relationship is also important and we will add our voice to that, as well as to the issue of the undocumented Irish and other initiatives.

It includes an overarching ambition of 2.5 million people in work by 2024.  Crucially, these jobs will be more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity, aligned with our green and digital ambitions.  The plan included labour market and enterprise supports, which budget 2022 and more recent announcements built upon.  Importantly, the plan is about the sustainable rebuilding and renewal of our economy across four pillars, namely: helping people back into work; rebuilding sustainable enterprises; having a balanced and inclusive recovery; and ensuring sustainable public finances.  These objectives are supported by investment, including through Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan, the revised national development plan, and the Brexit adjustment reserve.<\/p>  <p>  A progress report on implementation will be published in the coming months, outlining the considerable progress to date, as reflected in a strong recovery in economic growth and employment during the second half of 2021.  Overall employment levels recovered to exceed pre-pandemic levels at 2,471,200 as of the third quarter of 2021, or a Covid-adjusted level of 2,369,731, with employment increasing in all 13 economic sectors between the third quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021.  In the first nine months of 2021, the economy grew by approximately 14.5% in GDP terms and 12.9% in terms of GNP compared with the same period in 2020.  Over the year, modified final domestic demand grew by 5.3%.  Some examples of progress include the roll-out of activation and employment support through Pathways to Work; publication of the Housing for All strategy, which has resulted in more than 30,000 commencements in 2021; and the climate action plan 2021, which was published last October.  In addition, a new national digital strategy, a commitment under the economic recovery plan, was published on 1 February.<\/p> <p>Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework aims to position Ireland as a digital leader at the heart of European and global digital developments.  It aims to drive and enable the digital transition across the economy and society, to maximise the well-being of our citizens, the efficiency of public services, the productivity and innovation of enterprise, and our overall competitiveness and sustainability.  It places a strong emphasis on balance, inclusiveness, security and safety.  Its ambitions are in line with EU priorities, under the Digital Decade 2030.<\/p> <p> Harnessing Digital is structured around four dimensions, in line with the EU's digital compass: digital transformation of business; digital infrastructure; skills; and digitalisation of public services.  Targets, high-level work streams and associated deliverables focus on: our determination to help businesses to advance their digital transformation, particularly SMEs, to sustain Ireland's attractiveness as a location for leading digital enterprises and to maximise benefits for the wider ecosystem; the importance of digital infrastructure enablers, namely, universal connectivity and robust cybersecurity capacity and expertise; skills for all to ensure society can engage with and benefit from digitalisation; and driving further digitalisation of public services, with a focus on the health system.<\/p> <p> It also sets out our commitment to continue to build a modern, cohesive, well-resourced network of regulators to effectively oversee and enforce digital regulations.

This directive is among the most far-reaching and most significant pieces of legislation ever to be adopted by the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits to society and democracy from protecting people of conscience who speak up about wrongdoing are clear if we reflect for a moment on the range of issues that would not have seen light of day if not for the courage of a whistleblower.  Sadly, for too many, the decision to highlight wrongdoing often comes at a great personal cost to the individual and his or her family.  This can have a chilling effect, putting off others from stepping forward.  Whistleblowers play a vital role in a functioning democracy.  We in the Oireachtas must accept our responsibility for what happens to them.  We must ensure that we have strong and effective laws to protect people who have the bravery to speak up about wrongdoing.  This Bill represents a big step in the right direction in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, of course, has a strong legislative foundation in the area of whistleblower protection.  In 2014, we were just the sixth country in the EU to introduce comprehensive legislation for the protection of whistleblowers in the form of the Protected Disclosures Act.  The 2014 Act was an innovative piece of legislation for its time and remains highly regarded as one of the strongest whistleblower protection laws in the world.  While this may be the case, for some, however, the protections in place have not gone far enough.  Listening to the contributions from whistleblowers in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, it is clear that we must strive to do better at protecting those who report wrongdoing.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to the directive, many of the provisions contained in that directive are already in place here in Ireland thanks to the 2014 Act.  The Act prohibits any form of retaliation against a worker who makes a protected disclosure and also protects workers from civil and criminal liability for any disclosure of confidential information necessary to report a wrongdoing.  The Act provides multiple channels for workers to report concerns so that if one channel fails to operate as intended, there are other avenues through which workers can speak up safely.<\/p>  <p>  The directive, however, goes much further in terms of its application.  In particular, it significantly widens the scope of persons who are entitled to protection for speaking up.  It will require many employers to establish formal channels and procedures for their workers to report concerns about wrongdoing.  It also requires recipients of disclosures to take very specific steps within clear timelines to follow-up on the reports they receive.<\/p> <p>I welcome all of these changes, which will further strengthen and enhance our legislation and ensure Ireland remains at the leading edge in terms of the legal protections for whistleblowers.<\/p> <p> We must also take this opportunity to reflect on the impact the Protected Disclosures Act has had since it was signed into law in 2014 and consider what enhancements and improvements we can provide beyond the directive in this regard, as was committed to in the programme for Government.  The findings of the 2018 statutory review of the Act and the responses to the public consultation on the general scheme have all fed into the development of this Bill.  A key finding of the statutory review was that the legislation needed to give clearer direction to recipients as to what to with the reports they receive.  The new requirements arising from the directive go a long way towards addressing this.  The statutory review also raised significant concerns about how disclosures made to Ministers under section 8 of the Act should be handled.  In many cases, reports are being made in the first instance to Ministers, which was never the intention of the Act.  Furthermore, reports are in some cases made simultaneously or in quick succession to both the employer and the Minister or other reporting channels without affording time for the matter to be addressed by the initial recipient.  This was also identified as a concern by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton in the third interim report of the disclosures tribunal.  The changes to the ministerial channel proposed in the Bill are intended to address these issues.<\/p> <p> Another issue for Ministers is that they often find they are limited in what they can do to follow up on certain reports, especially if the matter involves a statutorily independent public body.  The Bill therefore provides for ministerial disclosures to be transmitted to the new protected disclosures commissioner, who will take on responsibility for directing reports to the most appropriate persons to address the matter concerned.  This will ensure an independent and thorough follow-up of all protected disclosures sent to Ministers of the Government.  The commissioner will also take on the role of prescribed person of last resort, ensuring there is always an independent external person for workers to report to, if needed.  This role will be taken on by the Ombudsman and is in line with trends in other countries where national ombudsmen have been given similar responsibilities in this area.<\/p> <p> Another recent development the Bill must take into account is the ruling of the Supreme Court of 1 December 2021 in the Baranya case, which found that an individual raising a private grievance can also attract the protections of the 2014 Act.  While the court agreed that the intent of the Act was to protect persons who report wrongdoing solely in the public interest, the wording of the Act allowed for a broader application.  This anomaly cannot be allowed to stand and the Bill makes provision in this regard.<\/p> <p> Last, but by no means least, in terms of the development of the Bill, I would like to make a few points about the pre-legislative scrutiny undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  I thank the committee for its thorough and comprehensive report, which clearly reflects the strong engagement and personal interest its members have in this topic.  The pre-legislative scrutiny report contains some 60 recommendations.  Many of the committee's recommendations are provided for in the Bill.  For example, I am repealing section 5(7A) of the principal Act, which imposed a public interest test on disclosures of information containing trade secrets.  I am providing that prescribed persons must accept and follow up on anonymous disclosures, unless prohibited by another enactment.  I am providing for the new office of the protected disclosures commissioner to be established as a statutorily independent entity free to discharge its functions under the Act as it sees fit.  I am also significantly expanding and enhancing the collection and publication of statistics on the number of protected disclosures made, so as to better evaluate the impact of the Act and inform future policy development in this area.<\/p> <p> The work of considering the committee's recommendations is not done.  I have referred a number of them to the Attorney General for further consideration.  Implementing some of the recommendations may be complex from a legal perspective and more time is needed for this consideration.  Given the deadline of 17 December 2021 for the transposition of the directive, I did not want to delay the publication of the Bill any further.  Accordingly, I will bring a number of amendments during the later Stages of the Bill in respect of some of the committee's recommendations.  I again thank the committee for its significant work, which took seven months to complete.  I wanted to await the conclusion of the pre-legislative scrutiny phase before proceeding to publish the full Bill.<\/p> <p> In particular, I acknowledge that there was disappointment in some quarters that the Bill does not address the status of existing protected disclosures that have been made before this new legislation comes into force.  I acknowledge that this is a very important issue.  It is a complex issue but it is one area in particular on which I have asked my officials to work with the Attorney General with a view to bringing proposals on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  As this is amending legislation, some sections need to be read in conjunction with the Principal Act, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Some sections of the Bill are also quite technical.  In this regard, I will make my officials available to Members if any further technical briefing on the Bill is required.  The Bill comprises the following parts.  Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 3, inclusive, contains a number of standard legislative provisions concerning the Short Title and commencement and, as amending legislation, identifies the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 as being the principal Act being amended.  Section 3 provides for the repeal of certain provisions of the Principal Act rendered redundant by the amendments provided for elsewhere in this Bill.<\/p> <p> Part 2 comprises six chapters, each of which in some way amends or extends the Principal Act.  Chapter 1, comprising sections 4 to 7, inclusive, sets out the scope of application of the legislation.  Section 4 sets out a number of important definitions used in the legislation.  Of particular note here is the amended definition of \"worker\", which provides for the expansion of the scope of the Act to include: volunteers, board members, shareholders and job applicants, as required by the directive.  Section 5 is a standard provision concerning the making of orders and regulations under the Act.<\/p> <p> Section 6 amends the definition of a \"protected disclosure\" to explicitly cover any breaches of the EU laws specified in the material scope of the directive.  This section also provides for the insertion of a new subsection (5A) into section 5 of the principal Act that provides that the Act does not apply to personal employment grievances that solely affect the worker making the complaint and no one else.  This addresses the findings of the Supreme Court in the recent Baranya case.  Section 7 provides that persons who make anonymous disclosures are still entitled to the protections of the Act if their identity is deduced and they suffer retaliation.<\/p> <p> Chapter 2, comprising sections 8 to 13, inclusive, concerns the design and operation of internal and external reporting channels to employers and prescribed persons.  Section 8 provides that private sector entities with 50 or more employees must establish formal whistleblowing channels.  In acknowledgment of the administrative burden placed on certain businesses, a derogation has been obtained for those businesses which employ between 50 and 249 employees.  Those employers have until December 2023 to establish formal whistleblowing channels.  This section also provides for the Minister to lower this threshold in certain sectors where there is a high risk of serious wrongdoing, if required.<\/p> <p> Section 9 sets out how the internal channels should operate and requires that all reports be acknowledged within seven days, the manner in which reports should be followed up and that feedback should be given to the reporting person within three months.  These rules are at the core of the directive and, as Members will see, are therefore restated and reaffirmed throughout the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 10 similarly requires prescribed persons to establish reporting channels for workers in the sectors they regulate and section 11 provides again that prescribed persons must acknowledge, follow up and give feedback to reporting persons in respect of the reports they receive.<\/p> <p> Section 12 concerns reports made to Ministers of the Government and sets out new conditions for making these reports and requires that Ministers shall transmit all reports they receive to the new protected disclosures commissioner.  Section 13 amends section 10 of the principal Act and sets out new conditions for the making of public disclosures.  These conditions are significantly simplified compared with the original provision in the principal Act.<\/p> <p> Chapter 3 concerns the new office of the protected disclosures commissioner and comprises sections 14 and 15, inclusive.  Section 14 inserts six new sections, namely, 10A to 10F, inclusive, into the Act after section 10.<\/p> <p> Section 10A provides for the establishment of the new office of the protected disclosures commissioner in the Office of the Ombudsman.  Section 10B provides for the commissioner to have formal channels and procedures for handling disclosures in the same manner as apply to prescribed persons.<\/p> <p> Sections 10C and 10D concern the handling of disclosures made or transmitted to the commissioner.  In the first instance, the commissioner shall attempt to identify either a prescribed person or another suitable person with the competence to follow-up on the matter reported and transmit the report to that person for further action.  If no person can be found, the commissioner shall apply the standard rules as regards acknowledgment, follow-up and feedback as required by the directive in respect of prescribed persons.<\/p> <p> Section 10E provides that where a report is transmitted to a third party not subject to the requirement to have formal reporting channels, that person shall follow the standard rules as regards acknowledgment, follow-up and feedback.  Section 10F provides for powers of investigation for the commissioner in the event that direct follow-up of a report is required.<\/p> <p> Section 15 inserts a new schedule to the Act concerning a number of standard provisions regarding the keeping of accounts and the staffing of the office of the protected disclosures commissioner.<\/p> <p> Chapter 4, comprising sections 16 to 20, inclusive, transposes a number of provisions of the directive applicable to internal reporting to employers and external reporting to prescribed persons and the commissioner.  Section 16 obliges persons responsible for handling protected disclosures to keep the identity of reporting persons confidential, overhauling a similar provision in the principal Act.  Section 17 introduces a new requirement to similarly keep the identities of other persons named in a disclosure confidential.  Section 18 provides for the restriction of certain data subject access rights to prevent these rights being abused to out a whistleblower or frustrate or impede effective follow-up on a report.  Section 19 specifies how records of protected disclosures shall be kept.  Section 20 imposes a similar restriction on the Freedom of Information Act to section 18 and, again, is intended to protect reporting persons&rsquo; identities and prevent attempts to impede or frustrate follow-up.<\/p> <p> Chapter 5, comprising sections 21 to 25, inclusive, concerns the enhanced protection measures required by the directive.  Key changes introduced in this chapter include: the extension of interim relief to acts of penalisation other than dismissal; reversal of the burden of proof in civil cases concerning penalisation, so employers will have to prove the alleged act of penalisation was not taken because the worker made a protected disclosure; and the provision of a set of offences for contraventions of the Act.<\/p> <p> Chapter 6, comprising sections 26 to 33, inclusive, provides for a number of incidental and supplementary measures, including: removal of the restriction on public disclosure of taxpayer information for certain types of reports; provision for the Minister to issue statutory guidance to assist public bodies, prescribed persons and the commissioner in best practice in the handling of reports; the provision of freely available information on how to make a disclosure and the protections afforded by the Act; enhanced provisions as regards the provision of statistical information to the Minister on the numbers of protected disclosures made and for the publication of said information; and powers for the Workplace Relations Commission inspectorate to monitor and enforce compliance with the requirement on employers to have internal reporting channels.<\/p> <p> The Bill inserts two new schedules into the principal Act.  Schedule 5 is a set of standard provisions as regards the keeping of accounts and the staffing of the office of the protected disclosures commissioner, while Schedule 6 reproduces the annex to the directive, listing all of the EU laws that lie within its material scope.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I reiterate my thanks to the Members of both Houses who worked on the pre-legislative scrutiny report on this Bill, which has greatly influenced its development.  I would also like to thank the various stakeholders who have contributed to the development of this Bill, including those who took the time to make submissions to the public consultation when the general scheme of the Bill was being developed and those who attended the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings at the committee.  Their input has also provided great help in the preparation of this Bill.  I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who have been working on this Bill for a long time, and the officials in the Office of the Attorney General for their assistance in what is complex and at times technical legislation.  We can all agree it is a fundamentally important Bill and it is important that we get this right.<\/p> <p> I want to signal to Members that I am, of course, open to amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage through the passage of this Bill in both Houses.  Where I believe the amendments improve the Bill and can be put into operation and improve the protections for whistleblowers, I am open to amendments and I want to be very upfront and clear about that.<\/p> <p> I thank all the Members of this House for their attention and I very much look forward to hearing their contributions during the remainder of Second Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500022#W01100","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644944700,"counter":289,"content":"<p>It is important to note that this Bill came about not because of a desire necessarily to improve our existing protected disclosures regime and it was not inspired by the need to give further protections to the many whistleblowers whose concerns have been raised in this Chamber or to set a new standard in whistleblowing protection.  The reason the Bill is before us today is to satisfy the transposition of the EU's whistleblowing directive and its mandatory reporting requirements.  However, the crafting of the Bill gave us an opportunity to reflect on our whistleblowing regime and to understand what is working well and not working well.  Over the course of the last few months, when this was discussed within the committee, it was an eye-opener for many committee members as to the different issues that so many whistleblowers and transparency campaigners face.  I commend all of those who came before the committee and who told their very personal stories and told of the personal difficulties they faced as a result of their whistleblowing.<\/p>  <p>  As the legislation is almost ten years old, a review was timely.  I take on board that the Minister has said he would welcome amendments on Committee Stage.  My colleague, Deputy Buckley, and I had drafted our own Bill, which looked to raise the bar and which could be used to ensure there is no lowering of existing standards.  We know that whistleblowers play a key role in society and that is very true when we look at our own history within this State.<\/p>  <p>  Transparency International says that whistleblowing is acknowledged as one of the most effective ways of stopping wrongdoing.  For example, many of the cases of corruption and fraud that we know about have been exposed by workers who reported those issues to their employers, regulators or the press.  In fact, it is believed that more cases of fraud and corruption are exposed by whistleblowers than by any other actor, including the police and the media.  We saw the very difficult situations that people have faced as a result of doing that.  Unfortunately, as we know, when a whistleblower does reveal wrongdoing, the primary concern of the authorities can be reputational damage to the organisation and there can be an attempt, as we have seen, to circle the wagons, cast aspersions on whistleblowers&rsquo; motivations and engage in retaliation.  That means the whistleblowers themselves can suffer greatly for acting in the public interest and they pay a very high price for speaking out, both financially and in terms of their health.<\/p>  <p>  That is why we felt there was a need to remove the cap on awards.  We saw the evidence in the committee that people are ostracised as a result of speaking out in the public interest and research shows that people lose over &euro;40,000 in the course of their working life as a result.  We felt it should be changed to &ldquo;fair and equitable&rdquo; but, as the Minister said, we will discuss that on Committee Stage, when we can go into this further.  This is something we need to look at because it can help set the standard on these issues.  This kind of information and this work is something we very much rely on.  With our own Bill, we were hoping to set a standard that could be used but we will bring that up on Committee Stage, when we can discuss this in greater detail.<\/p>  <p>  All of this work needs to be crafted in consultation with whistleblowers, legal practitioners and academics in order that we can draw on the highest standards of national whistleblowing legislation across the various EU jurisdictions.  We see what the Nordic countries have done in this regard.  I think we can be the shining light on this, given we owe so much to our whistleblowers.<\/p> <p>We had hoped any research that could be done within the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach would have assisted with this Bill being undertaken.  We have to give credit to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for the massive job of work it did.  It gave the Bill the seriousness it warranted, which helped pave the way for the substantial report that was issued as a result.  We heard the testimony of many whistleblowers and they worked in the public and the private sector in junior and senior positions and they were from all different backgrounds.  They were all united in one factor; each and every one of them spoke out because they believed it served the public interest and that the public had a right to know.  Most importantly, they recognised that if the public knew what was going on, it would not accept it, which was the crux of the matter.<\/p> <p> The committee also heard the expert opinion of groups like Transparency International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and we heard from members of the bodies representing the legal profession and those working in mental health services.  These people also played a valuable role in helping to shape the 60 recommendations issued in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  The Minister recently said to me that he judges each and every Bill on its merits and so do we.  I have to be fair to the Minister and I acknowledge those areas where he made amendments in line with the Bill Deputy Buckley and I brought forward and in line with the recommendations of the committee and that is welcome.  It is good to see that co-operative work and to hear the Minister say he will continue to work with us.  Section 4 includes the expansion of the meaning of \"work\", which is extremely important because it includes volunteers and that is an area where there can be concerns.  That should have included journalists as well but we will bring that to Committee Stage and we can talk about that in greater detail then.  I welcome the expansion of that meaning because it will be of relief to many.<\/p> <p> There are also areas we probably could have worked on.  I see that, for example, the Minister has included an exemption for organisations with fewer than 50 employees.  It is not that costly to put this in place and that is probably unnecessary.  We can talk about that in greater detail another time.  The Bill will establish a new protected disclosures office within the Office of the Ombudsman.  Concerns have been raised about this and we need to be frank about that.  Some people have concerns that protected disclosures could be sent to a letter box or a filing cabinet but it is up to us to make sure that does not happen.  We need to be clear that this will set a standard and that it does not end up being that kind of thing and we need to make sure that as many people as possible have full confidence in it.  We need to be clear that this office is staffed correctly and resourced appropriately.  I raised the issue of staff qualification numbers and funding with the Minister at the start of the month and we need to make sure that office is fully resourced and staffed.  When I raised that point at the start of the month, the Minister said he was still working on that so we need to make sure we have those details and I had hoped to have them before this Bill was brought before the D&aacute;il.  Hopefully we will get that information soon because it is important for the confidence of those past and future whistleblowers in the system.  A lot of them, including the ones we have listened to, have been failed.  We need to acknowledge that and make sure they know we are taking this very seriously.<\/p> <p> The Bill will introduce new and restrictive conditions for public service workers looking to make a protected disclosure to the Minister.  Another point on which we raised concern is the so-called emergency situation the Minister is proposing to put on public service whistleblowers for making a protected disclosure to the Minister and that is regressive.  Concerns were raised when it was discussed in the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that this could lower existing standards.  As the committee recommended, this should have been removed.  It is good to see that penalisation will include vexatious proceedings and attempting to hinder further reporting.  That is important and something we had a lot of conversations about during Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> My party will support this Bill.  We are looking forward to the Committee Stage debate to discuss it, to see what our different recommendations are and to see how we can work together to ensure we do what is best in the interests of everyone and of whistleblowers.  When we talk about the best interests of whistleblowers we mean the best interests of everyone because the work whistleblowers do is essential to everyone in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500024#Y00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644945300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill.  Protected disclosures and whistleblowers are often a force for good and an essential component in exposing corruption, illegality, criminality and wrongdoing in public and private bodies.  Sometimes they are workers and sometimes they are volunteers and I hope that will get teased out.  According to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, whistleblowing is among the most effective means of exposing and remedying corruption, fraud and other types of wrongdoing in the public and private sectors.  The important step is to protect the whistleblower and create the environment in which he or she can blow the whistle.  Then we must also remedy the issue because that sends a powerful message to other whistleblowers.  Often the fear that nothing will happen after you speak out causes people not to speak out when they really want to do so in order to make something happen.  It is important that those two things would happen together.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen time and time again that whistleblowing has been valuable in the areas of policing and law enforcement; environmental protection; finance; education; and healthcare.  I want to pay tribute to those whistleblowers who have come forward and spoken up.  We owe them and we should never forget that.  My colleague, an Teachta Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has been raising the need to modernise legislation in this area since she was elected and this has been very high on her agenda.  Along with an Teachta Buckley, she introduced legislation to amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 last December.  I am sure the publication of that Bill went in no small way to ensuring we are discussing this Bill, which, as has been pointed out, is welcome.  It is my firm contention that the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill from na Teachta&iacute; Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Buckley has many superior aspects and I hope the Minister will take on board those constructive suggestions that have been coming from an Teachta Mair&eacute;ad Farrell on Committee Stage.  The Minister will be aware of those suggestions.<\/p>  <p>  Modernisation of this legislation on protected disclosures is essential if we want to tackle corruption.  For too long a lack of support and protections has left whistleblowers exposed to victimisation and penalisation.  We have seen this happen before our eyes with high-profile whistleblowers in this State and we have sometimes seen the full weight of the machinery of the State come down on whistleblowers.  I have worked with whistleblowers, held their hands, made them tea and tried to encourage them to come forward and sometimes they are terrified.  They believe that if they can get the story they have to tell onto the right desk and if it is given the right attention, they will see real action taken.  However, they are often terrified and the Oireachtas needs to send a message to them that we will be on their side and that when they come forward they will be listened to and believed.  When it comes to protecting them in the inevitable aftermath, the full weight of the Oireachtas must be behind protecting them and making sure they do not go down the road we have seen other whistleblowers forced down.  We need to be able to tell them they can come forward and that they will be believed and listened to.  Most importantly we must be able to tell them that action will be taken and that they will be protected.  As an Teachta Mair&eacute;ad Farrell has outlined, we welcome this Bill and we look forward to strengthening it and making it more robust on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500025#Z00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1644945300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Given what we know about whistleblowers in this State, legislation to protect them is not only welcome, but essential.  Whistleblowers commonly report subsequent difficulty in the workplace and outright denial or dismissal of their concerns.  They also report being pressed to take leave, sidelined, removed or replaced.  The organisation intent on protecting itself too often hangs them out to dry.  Recently we had Dr. Ankur Sharma in Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, who it is reported felt sidelined after he raised the serious and systemic failures in youth mental health services in Kerry.  Who could forget Sergeant Maurice McCabe, and not what happened to him but what was done to him when he was forced out of the job he loved?<\/p>  <p>  Protecting those who make disclosures in the public interest is vital and overdue and this Bill provides both internal and external channels for so doing.<\/p> <p>It is especially troubling for those who disclose information that when it comes to the State, their own money, taxpayer's money, is used against them as the State engages in legal and other action to defend what is often indefensible, not because it should but because it can.  The State uses public money and public resources to do so.<\/p> <p> I am very happy to see that some of Sinn F&eacute;in's concerns about the Bill as initially presented have been addressed, although we do have some outstanding concerns.  The Minister stated that he is open to accepting amendments Committee Stage.  It is the first time I have heard a Minister saying that since I was elected, and it is very welcome.<\/p> <p> In terms of our outstanding concerns, first, there are no psychological supports on offer to the person making the disclosure, which is a serious omission.  As Deputy Louise O'Reilly just outlined, many people are extremely nervous when it comes to making protected disclosures.  The joint committee recommended that free legal aid and psychological services be provided to those making a disclosure.  Such a provision was included in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill presented by Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Buckley.  Second, there is a new restrictive conditionality that must be satisfied before public service workers can make a disclosure to a Minister.  This is referred to as an emergency situation.  This disclosure will then automatically transfer to the protected disclosures office.  Third, the Bill exempts private sector organisations with fewer than 50 employees from the reporting requirements.  This is not only unnecessary, it creates risks.  We have many financial services firms in Ireland, for example, that have fewer than 50 employees but they handle vast amounts of money.  In that context, I hope the Minister will reconsider the exemption for companies with fewer than 50 employees because it means that anyone making a protected disclosure in such companies will not have access to the same protections.  This is a flaw that will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.  Fourth, the Bill does not remove the cap on awards.  Since many whistleblowers face ruin in their careers, this is a serious omission which must be corrected.

I also thank Minister for his opening remarks because while we will not always agree, we can agree to disagree.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the establishment of a new office but it needs teeth and adequate resources.  Obviously, that can be chiselled out.  There are some problematic sections including the exemption for smaller companies with fewer than 50 employees, which has already been mentioned.  That will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The problem at the moment is that while people have been brave enough to come forward and make protected disclosures, the existing legislation, which is based on the European directive, is very weak.  There is no procedure by means of which one can find out if a whistleblower was protected and if the issue that was reported was ever resolved.  If there is going to be a commission, it needs to be fully resourced because it is very difficult, even for us, to get a reply all the way up to the final stop.  When a report comes back to say that the issues have been addressed, often it is the case that they have not been.  What happens then?  There is nobody to investigate the body in question.<\/p>  <p>  The issues of free legal aid and mental health assistance will also need to be teased out on Committee Stage.  It is imperative that we protect whistleblowers.  They should have 100% protection.  To leave such provisions out of the Bill would be very worrying because we know that all of those who have been brave enough to make protected disclosures in the past have been damaged mentally, physically and financially.  People do not make protected disclosures for glory or honour.  Their actions are about doing the right thing in the public interest.  Reference is made in the Bill to the option for whistleblowers to remain anonymous, although some are quite happy for their name to be made public when they make a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that we can resolve the issues of concern in this Bill.  We will work together on it.  This is about setting out a gold-standard protected disclosure regime that will benefit everybody in this country and I look forward to working with the Minister on the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500026#AA00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644945900,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1644945900,"counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500026#AA00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1644945900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute;

That said, it is not the case that I have not taken a keen interest in the passage and progress of this legislation, given the history of my own party's involvement in the development of what became the 2014 Act.  Deputy Buckley articulated very well a lot of the concerns that have been expressed across this House about how the 2014 legislation has been operated.  The reality is that all of us in this House have dealt with, advocated for and represented people who have taken courage in their own hands to identify wrongdoing in organisations in which they work and we all want to have the best possible system in place to protect them when they go about that important business.  Such business is really intrinsic to our democracy and the functioning of same and to be fair to the Minister, he acknowledged that in the earlier part of his contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I may not have been in a position to make a contribution to the pre-legislative scrutiny process but I certainly will be making a contribution on behalf of the Labour Party to the Committee and latter Stages of this Bill as it progresses through the House.  I very much welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on it on behalf of the Labour Party.  The Bill will see the transposition of the whistleblowing directive into Irish law, which is a welcome development.  It is worth noting, as the Minister said earlier, that Ireland is one of a minority of EU states that already has a set of legal protections in place to protect whistleblowers.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Protected Disclosures Act dates back to 2014 and was one of a series of reform initiatives undertaken by my party colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, when he was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  One of the most significant changes to the Act arising from the transposing of the directive will be the extension of the law as it relates to the requirement to establish clear reporting channels and procedures in private industry and private businesses.  The public service was, of course, a good place to start in 2014.  If one wants to start, one starts with the State and State-run and State-supported services but wrongdoing is as big a problem, if not a bigger problem, in the private sector as it is anywhere else.  Those who uncover a problem in a private sector body should have the same rights and processes available to them as those in the public sector.  There ought to be consistency in this regard and I do not think anybody would argue otherwise.  No worker anywhere, regardless of where he or she works, should fear penalisation for reporting malpractice and there should be always be consistency in that regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The new law, when passed, will make it mandatory for companies with over 50 staff to set up an internal mechanism and clear procedures to handle, progress and report on complaints, which is a good thing.<\/p> <p>The issue for me is what happens in organisations where there are fewer than 50 employees.  This has been mentioned by other Deputies.  The response of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to the public consultation is worth reflecting on.  It reaffirmed that the protections available under the Protective Disclosures Act do not distinguish between large and small employers.  The directive will require all employers to accept, engage, provide feedback, follow up, etc. on disclosures.  The need to have an internal reporting channel is, as the WRC stated, consistent with that obligation.<\/p> <p> I am concerned about the absence of a requirement to have internal reporting channels in smaller firms.  I assume the argument is that this would place a significant administrative burden on smaller business.  I understand that, but a clear reporting mechanism would help everyone in all circumstances regardless of the size of the firm.  Smaller firms may operate more informally.  That runs the risk of the confidentiality of a disclosure being threatened regardless of where it might be made.  It might be made to an external body but given how things operate, and we all understand that, there is a risk that things could get out, which would make confidentiality a problem, and then penalisation and victimisation become problems.  The Minister should take another look at that before Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The provision for tighter and clearer timeframes on the progressing and investigation of protected disclosures is very welcome.  We are often contacted by whistleblowers, I am sure that the Minister is too, about active cases because they are concerned that those cases are going around in circles or are going nowhere at all.  They fear that the system is circling the wagons and protecting itself, as systems do, in the hope that by stringing out a disclosure that the complainant will become exhausted and frustrated and simply fold up their tents and go away.  People take a huge risk when they draw attention to wrongdoing.  The Minister is aware of this.  We all know that it can take an enormous personal toll.  I am somewhat encouraged by some of the research that suggests that only a minority of workers who blow the whistle experience detrimental impacts.  However, while it might be a minority of workers it is a significant minority.  We know that from work undertaken by Transparency International and others.  Even one worker who experiences a detrimental impact is one too many.  While we can never achieve perfection we should always strive to have the best possible system in place.  The system should always seek to properly support, protect and embrace complainants and those bringing forward protective disclosures.<\/p> <p> All of us have worked with and represented far too many courageous people who put themselves at great risk to tell the truth and expose wrongdoing.  People have been victimised, targeted and traumatised as they have stood up to an often unforgiving system.  That is one important reason why clear timeframes on reporting, follow-up feedback and communication of the outcome of an investigation is so important.  It is crucial to public confidence and the utility of the system and the idea that if a person makes a complaint that it will be handled properly, transparently and in a timely fashion.  The reforms and new provisions will provide some comfort to those who may wish to make protected disclosures in future.<\/p> <p> I welcome the clear requirement on competent authorities to publish clear and straightforward information on their websites on the protections afforded to disclosures, details on how reports are handled and progressed and the remedies available to whistleblowers against retaliation and the fact that confidential advice is also available to people who are often in very difficult circumstances.  Those who do take the courage into their hands and disclose information, motivated by a sense of what is right, should be embraced and properly supported by the system.<\/p> <p> Some of the more subtle ways by which employees can be penalised by their employers for blowing the whistle are now to be included in new definitions of penalisation that are in the directive and, as the Minister noted, significantly the burden of proof rests on the employers.  The legislation will mean that when a person brings a case to the WRC or the courts about penalisation for making a protected disclosure, the burden of proof will clearly fall on the employer.  In simple terms, the authorities will work on the basis of the assumption that the alleged act of penalisation, say blacklisting or ostracism, took place because the worker involved made a protected disclosure unless and until the employer can prove to the contrary.  This will provide some important reassurance to those who have information they may wish to report and disclose.  I also welcome that, per the directive, the coverage of the Act has been extended to volunteers, board members of organisations, to job applicants and shareholders who will have an important role, as they have in company law for example.  It is important that they come under the scope of this legislation.<\/p> <p> Establishing a protected disclosures office under the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman is a very positive development.  I always struggle to understand how Ministers and officials can properly investigate and interrogate complaints and disclosures that might be made through their Departments.  It is important that there be an independent voice and channel that can investigate and expedite the consideration of complaints.  Too often, more by accident rather than design, conflicts of interest may have arisen in Departments.  A protected disclosure may be made to a Minister.  We do not know who is investigating it in the Department and confidentiality can become a problem.  People can feel that they are victimised and targeted and retraumatised, having first been traumatised first by what they saw or experienced in a Department or agency.  It is important that there be independent means by which a complaint can be handled and investigated.  That is crucial for the integrity of the process and for public confidence.<\/p> <p> I look forward to working with the Minister on Committee Stage.  I know he is sincere about agreeing to work with Deputies who may have legitimate concerns and ideals that may be better interrogated on Committee Stage to make the legislation more robust.  The legislation is a significant piece of work.  I am grateful to the officials because I know the work that goes into the transposition of a directive of this nature.  It is vast.  We want to get it right.  Ireland has a good record, objectively speaking.  We were one of the first European Union member states to agree to legislate to protect the interests of whistleblowers through the Protective Disclosures Act 2014.  Like all legislation, it needs to evolve.  It was of its time as the Minister said earlier.  We have learned a lot through experience of how the Act operates by our constituents and others and by the Department and its officials in its operation.  It is useful that the experience is in here.  It can be improved significantly if the Minister considers some of my points.<\/p> <p> We will seek to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  We look forward to working with the Minister because, as I said, this Bill is intrinsic to the operation of our democracy and confidence in it.  We know the impact brave whistleblowers have made as agents of change in this country.  They have identified wrong-doing and systemic problems that need to be rooted out and where change is needed.  People like Sergeant Maurice McCabe have done the State some service.  This House, previous Governments and this Government recognise that.  We owe it to him and to others who have taken brave stances against wrongdoing to get this legislation right and have a world-class best practice system operating in our country to protect the interests of those who stand up to be counted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500026#AA00800","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644947100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

Low- and middle-income households needed actions that met the scale of those challenges.  A Government that understood the challenge they face would respond to support them.  However, we know this Government does not get it and has failed to meet that challenge.  The package announced last week will see Ministers receiving the same financial support to light and heat their homes as workers on the minimum wage.  That is crazy.  This Government will spend more than &euro;12 million on electricity credits to more than 62,000 holiday homes throughout the State while low- and middle-income households face price spikes in the cost of gas, electricity and home heating oil.  This is a Government that is out of touch, out of ideas and out of time.  A Sinn F&eacute;in Government would have provided targeted support to low- and middle-income households at speed and at scale.  This Government has failed to respond to the challenge.<\/p><p>The failure is no more evident than in the area of housing.  This D&aacute;il and this Government should be constantly reminded that the housing and rental crisis did not fall from the sky.  It did not happen by accident; it happened a direct consequence of the policies and decisions made by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael elected representatives.  Ministers, some of whom have been at the Cabinet table for more than a decade, often comment on the housing crisis as if they were some type of spectator but they are key players in the housing crisis, and you cannot spin reality.  In the 12 months to November, house prices rose by 14%.  We are close to reaching what I believe is and has been the objective of this Government for the past decade, that is, to push house prices back up to Celtic tiger peaks.  It is to pump up the housing market, to maximise its proceeds for shareholders, developers and institutional investors.  The problem the Government faces is that policy has now damaged the quality of life and life prospects of renters while locking workers and families out of home ownership.  The average rent across the State now stands at &euro;1,500 and in Dublin at more than &euro;2,000.  That is the legacy of this Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  It is renters struggling in this city and right across this State.  Saving for a deposit while paying extortionate rent is impossible while house prices seem so far beyond the reach of many.  The October budget, like the measures announced last week, ignored and forgot the struggles of renters.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have called for rents to be reduced and then frozen.  A Sinn F&eacute;in Government would introduce a refundable tax credit for renters to put one month's rent back into their pockets.  A Sinn F&eacute;in Government would ban rent increases because rent increases because renters cannot afford another rent increase.<\/p><p>While the Government continues to ignore the struggle of renters and homebuyers, it rolls out the red carpet to institutional investors like vulture funds and cuckoo funds.  It provides them with tax advantages that allow and encourage them to price homebuyers out of the market and push up rents.<\/p> <p>They pay no corporation tax on their rental profits and no capital gains tax when they sell the property.  They are the winners of Government policy, while renters and home buyers are certainly the losers.<\/p> <p> In 2019, real estate funds enjoyed an operating profit of &euro;1.2 billion and they did not pay a cent in corporation tax on those profits.  I have not made a mistake; real estate funds in 2019 enjoyed an operating profit of &euro;1.2 billion and they did not pay a cent of corporation tax on those profits.  In the first half of last year, IRES REIT, which owns more than 3,800 properties throughout the State, made profits of &euro;27 million.  It did not pay a red cent in corporation tax on any of those profits, which were made on the back of renters paying sky-high rents.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has warned this Government and this Minister for years that the sweetheart tax deals he granted these funds would undermine the efforts and interests of renters and buyers.  That has come to pass.  Now is the time for change.  It is long overdue.  This motion calls on the Government, once again, to end the tax advantage it deliberately gifted to investment funds in the housing market and instead fund and empower local authorities and homebuyers to purchase homes that can be bought or rented at affordable prices.  That is what a Sinn F&eacute;in government would do and, even at this late stage, that is what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael should do.  They should roll up the red carpet and stop allowing these funds to pay no tax. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500028#CC01700","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644947700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Institutional investors are distorting our housing market.  This is not some accident or force of nature; it is the policy of the Government.  For many years, a global wall of cheap money has been seeking out the highest yields in real estate investment.  In recent years, Government policy has thrown fuel on the housing fire, with all the obvious consequences.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, has talked about how there is no tax on the rent roll for these funds and no tax on capital gains.  In fact, in many cases, they can write off their dividend withholding tax against other costs.  At the same time, we have inferior design standards for apartments.  Why renters should have a lesser standard than buyers is beyond me.  We are also seeing increasingly poor decisions by developers and the board being challenged in the courts incurring further delays.  The consequence is that house prices and rents rise, buyers are locked out of the market and the housing crisis goes on and on.<\/p>  <p>  The measures the Government took last year simply make no difference.  The idea that an 8% increase in stamp duty would make it more difficult for funds to buy houses and duplexes ignores what is happening with rents.  We remind the Minister time and again that apartments are also homes. We need to price these high yield short-term investors out of the market and replace them with public investment, and good quality private sector investment, to deliver genuinely affordable homes for working people.  The Minister will wrongly say that Sinn F&eacute;in is against private sector investment in the market; that is not the case.  We are against the bad investments that push up house prices, lock families out of home ownership and make the delivery of social and affordable homes ever more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  The motion before us presents very clear policy alternatives.  Ultimately, it is time to make a choice.  Is the Government on the side of small numbers of poorly regulated institutional investors that make maximum profits, or is it on the side of the delivery of genuinely affordable homes for working people to rent or buy at prices they can afford?  That is the difference between our party and that of the Minister.

The article stated that IRES REIT was &quot;planning to roll out its highly profitable &lsquo;buy-to-let&rsquo; model &ndash; a move that will drive up rents and house prices&quot;.  This news was not welcomed by anyone who came into my clinic.  These are people who are struggling to pay rent and just last week saw that rents have increased yet again, by 19% in County Galway and 8.8% in Galway city.  People fear bills coming through the door.  These are people who were served notices to quit by landlords and fear where they will go next.  The build-to-rent model of these investment funds just drives up rents and prices.  They are there to serve only the wealthiest in society.<\/p><p>We often hear from the Government that it is all about supply.  As long as we are increasing the supply of homes, by whatever means, we can bring down rents.  We know, however, and we have seen that funds are more than happy to let their properties sit idle, if they cannot get someone to pay that rent.  They do not want to allow a situation where rents are falling, which will mean a falling yield on their asset.  They are happy to maintain a situation of high rents.  A few months ago, right outside where I live in my estate in Mervue, Galway, one of these build-to-rents was given planning permission for apartments to be constructed just outside Mervue.  The people of Mervue were not happy to see that because, once again, they know and will see that their children and grandchildren will not benefit from this.  They will not be able to pay those rents.  It will just push them further away from home ownership and from even being able to rent.<\/p><p>The reality is the Government's housing policy is destroying generations of young people and older people.  When I hear Ministers telling us that the Government's housing policy is working, I do not disagree with them.  For me, the operational question is who exactly is it working for?  Who is it benefiting?  The answer is the investment funds and the large private developers serving them because our rental crisis, and that of the people of Galway, means record profits for them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500029#DD00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1644947700,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Nothing the Government has done has had any impact whatsoever on rising rents.

A classic example are the aptly named \"vulture funds\" which swoop into our distressed housing market to buy up housing stocks and portfolios.  Investment funds have the advantage of not being subject to the same constraints as the banks.  They have little or no concern about the backlash or negative consequences of their actions on their company branding so they are more inclined and more likely to take drastic action to protect their investments.  This can mean repossessing homes and evicting people.  These companies have only one goal, that is, to be profitable.  They achieve this by protecting their investments through offering those with a home loan a write down or eviction.  The banks win when they sell their loan books to investment funds because their reputations are not tarnished as they are not responsible for the eviction of the homeowner.  They do not like to have to offer write downs to individual mortgage holders as others on their books with distressed loans might look for a similar resolution to their repayment difficulties.  The vulture fund does not have these concerns and can do either with a view to what is in the best interests of its investors.<\/p>  <p>  Investment funds do enormous damage to Irish society by locking out those seeking to buy a home and forcing renters into paying unaffordable rents.  The Government is happy to let this continue regardless of the social and economic cost to the country as long as it can say that housing is available.  Vulture funds buying up large blocks of housing and apartments creates its own monopoly of sorts.  These investment funds will be the market drivers.  Through their ownership of vast numbers of apartments and houses they will have the leverage to determine market prices.  House prices will be and are being driven by these tactics.  They are no longer affordable by two professionals taking home incomes, which are above the national average.  This is not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure that in new housing developments institutional investment funds are locked out from purchasing in bulk by imposing a stamp duty surcharge and ending tax exemptions granted by the Government.

When I am in my constituency meeting constituents I, of course, experience first-hand the great concern they have regarding the rising cost of rent.  I meet families who are worried as to whether they will ever be able to buy a home or to afford their rent in the future.  These are issues and challenges that are affecting so many.  I absolutely understand the affect this is having on their lives and in our society and the obligation and need on behalf of this Government to respond and to make a difference.  <\/p><p>At the same time as I am meeting my constituents on the grave challenges they are confronting in their own lives, I see in my own constituency the huge housing project under way that is O'Devaney Gardens, which was opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is currently under construction, with more homes to come on this site, providing a mix of different forms of homes in private and public ownership to meet the very needs of the people I meet in my constituency.  That project that is happening. <\/p><p>In Dominick Street, I see the new apartments that are being built by Dublin City Council which will be available soon such that families can live in accommodation that they deserve and will be affordable to them.  Elsewhere in my constituency, I note the scale of new apartments that are being built at the bottom of Carnlough Road in Cabra.  These are new homes that are being built.  I know that we need more homes to be built quickly but these are projects that are under way that will have families in them and thus will alleviate the grave challenges that so many are now confronting.<\/p><p>Beyond this tale of individual projects, the reality is that homes are being built in our country.  While I know we need more homes to be built quickly, despite the impact of Covid on our country, more than 30,000 homes are being built.  Over the past 12 months, more than 30,000 homes have been commenced and there are over 39,000 in the planning system.  Behind every one of those figures is a house or an apartment that will become a home for a citizen, a worker or a family.  This Government is determined to repeat that year on year to make a sustainable and real difference to the challenges that are behind this motion but are not served by it.<\/p><p>Let us look at the reality of the scale of institutional investment within our country.  Currently, they account for 1% of the total housing stock and 7% of total tenancies, rising to, I accept, just under 15% within Dublin.  That is the total amount of accommodation with which these funds are associated.<\/p> <p>I referred to the delivery that is under way at the moment.  Behind that is a Government commitment of &euro;4 billion per year that this year alone will deliver well in excess of 6,000 to 7,000 new social homes for those who need them.  Those homes will be available this year.  The Government will also deliver the building of new homes for affordable rent and cost purchase.  That is the reality of what is happening this year because the Government recognises the challenges faced by many.  When Sinn F&eacute;in asks me whose side I am on, that is whose side I am on.  That is why I want additional supply and more homes built in our country.  The State needs to invest and has a role in supplying homes.  Some &euro;4 billion is being allocated for that this year.  The Government is on the side of those who want homes they can afford to buy, rent and live in.  We accept that we are doing this at a time when many are facing intense and difficult challenges but that is why we are responding with the scale of funding that is under way.  It is why we have the Land Development Agency, which will play an active role.  That is leading into the figures I shared with the House a moment ago.  More than 20,000 homes have been built.  More than 39,000 homes are at the planning permission stage.  The building of more than 30,000 homes has commenced.  I know many people want these homes delivered now.  They want more of those homes available now at a cheaper price and a cheaper rent.  In order to complete that journey and get to that point, we need homes to be built in our country year after year.  That is what this Government is committed to doing.<\/p> <p> It is not just the Government that has a role to play in this regard.  According to analysis prepared by my Department, we need approximately &euro;10 billion of private investment and private capital per year to get up to the 33,000 or 35,000 homes we need to deliver each year.  That figure at the moment is approximately &euro;6 billion per year.  We have a gap at the moment of approximately &euro;4 billion per year that needs to be filled to deliver new homes for the people I represent and who this Government is aiming to serve.  That is the role that institutional investment can play in meeting that need in our country.  As I said a moment ago, the scale of total accommodation they have is as I have shared with the House.  At the heart of these investment funds is the role they can play for our country in allowing us to organise savings that are held elsewhere in the world to deliver more housing supply in our country.  That is at the heart of what these investment funds and entities do.  I heard members of Sinn F&eacute;in say again and again that investment funds play a role in buying up housing stock that is already built.  I accept that when that happens, it is an issue.  That is why we brought in a surcharge last year on the bulk purchase of homes.  My contention to the D&aacute;il this evening is that those funds play a critical role in providing supply of new homes, apartments and houses in our country.  In their absence, supply would not be coming in.  The supply would not be available in our country at the scale it is.  That is the role these investors can play, accompanied by a Government that is spending &euro;4 billion, with a capital budget that is at an all-time high, a strong and active State that is directly investing to build more homes through our local authorities.  There is also a role for the private sector.<\/p> <p> The Government is aiming to achieve new social housing this year.  In 2022, we expect there will be more than 10,000 new social homes.  That target exists beside the role of these funds in providing rental accommodation, in particular.  In the absence of these funds operating in the way they are, it is our judgment and contention that the majority of those homes would not be built.  That is the equation.  More supply and more homes being built in our country will, over time, give us the best prospect we have.  We will do that as quickly as we can and address the issues of affordability and the cost of rent.  The State is also directly building homes through our local authorities.<\/p> <p> The proposals that are being brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in would lead to fewer homes being built and to higher rents and prices.  That is what I believe this is a recipe for.  When a Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson and others make the point about their ambitions to deliver more social homes, the figures in that regard are stark.  They claim they can build 20,000 social homes next year at a cost of &euro;3 billion.  That is a cost of &euro;150,000 per home.  Those are the maths.  We know homes in our State cannot be delivered for &euro;150,000 at the moment because of the very issues those Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies are raising about cost inflation and the pressures we and many others are facing around inflation for the materials that are needed to deliver those homes.  <\/p> <p> The case the Government and I are making is that we are playing an active role, building homes directly, creating the conditions for more private supply which, in turn, will create the environment in which we will be able to continue to make progress on the issues that renters and homeowners are raising regarding the cost of living, rent and owning a home.  I am on their side, as is Deputy Durkan.  Others from the Government benches who will speak on this motion are on their side.  That is why we are putting forward this countermotion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500030#EE00400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644948900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Fine Gael has been in government for ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500031#FF00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1644948900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The IMF was in government for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500031#FF00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1644948900,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Munster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500031#FF00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1644948900,"counter":332,"content":"<p>At least the Minister is going to make sure his buddies do not pay any tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500031#FF00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1644948900,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The IMF was in government for ten years.

People are in the ridiculous position of trying to compete with investment funds that can swoop in and buy up hundreds and even thousands of homes at inflated prices.  This is pushing up the price of housing and contributing to the current shameful situation where for many young people, owning a home is nothing but a pipe dream.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party introduced the system that brought these investment funds into the Irish market, awarding them frankly outrageous tax advantages and exemptions, including not having to pay corporation tax on income earned from rent.  This has contributed to the dysfunctional, cruel housing market we have now.  It has locked out people struggling to buy their own homes and is fuelling higher rents.  Here we are, nearly a decade on, dealing with the repercussions of this terrible policy decision.<\/p><p>In 2022, working people are finding it almost impossible to house themselves in a way that is affordable and sustainable.  People who are on decent pay and who in previous generations would never have struggled to buy a home are now unable to do so.  We all know why people want to own their own homes so badly.  The rental market is absolutely bonkers.  Rents are astronomical and increasing month on month, year on year, and there is no stability or security of tenure for anybody.  That is if one can find a place to rent.  A recent report from <i>daft.ie<\/i>stated the number of properties for rent is the lowest since it began tracking in 2006.  Rents in Louth increased by more than 8% in the past year alone.  We need to make housing affordable and we need to allow our young people to live their lives without the enormous worry and stress of paying for housing hanging over them.  Young people are not able to live normal lives.  Living with one's parents well into one's 20s and 30s is not normal, nor is it fair.  People are putting off getting married and having children.  Many, of course, are leaving the country altogether, not because they are unemployed but because successive Governments have made it impossible for them to live here.<\/p><p>I cannot fathom how the Minister, in all good conscience, can continue with these policies, knowing the damage, stress, sheer anxiety and enormous financial pressure and burden they are putting on his own people.

The average purchase cost of a home in 2021 was &euro;225,000.  The Government has completely abandoned renters and workers earning in the category of &euro;18,000 to &euro;60,000 in terms of either being able to buy a home or rent one with secure tenure tenancies.  The Government's budget and recent announcement delivered no solutions to these housing problems.  It has failed renters and rural dwellers.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has long called for an immediate rent freeze, which we would introduce, and provide renters with a tax rebate to the value of one month.  Give the renters a break.  Do not give it to the institutional investors.  Why not give it to our own people who are absolutely nailed to the wall every week and month trying to figure out where they will get the rent?  Give them a modest tax break of one month's rent back every year.  Workers and families need that break.  These two measures would provide some relief but also would help renters to save for a deposit.<\/p><p>Government spokespersons put much faith in increasing the supply of housing.  We want to increase the supply of housing.  I know it needs to be increased but the facts are that increasing supply alone will not bring down rents and will not bring down the price of housing.  All we have to do is look back to 2006 and 2007 when we built more than 90,000 homes per year, and what happened?  Rents literally went through the roof - pardon the pun - and the same with house prices in those two years.  Supply alone will not do it.

The Minister knows that we are in the midst of a real cost-of-living crisis.  The reality is that we have faced an affordability crisis in our housing and rental market for far longer.<\/p><p>Over the past year alone, we have seen house prices in County Louth experience double-digit growth with young couples from places like Drogheda, Dundalk, Laytown, Bettystown, east Meath and all across the constituency unable to settle down close to their families, friends and wider support networks.  Like people across the country, they remain caught in a vicious cycle of not being able to find an affordable home while being caught in a dysfunctional rental system that continues to eat up their weekly wage cheque and savings.<\/p><p>Rents in County Louth, for example, are now well in excess of double what they were during the last recession, with average rents in the county standing at just under &euro;1,400 per month.  The situation is much more acute in the Drogheda area.  Average rental prices in County Louth are now an astonishing 118.7% higher than at their lowest point during the last recession.  In the last 12 months alone, rents in Louth have increased by more than 8%.  This is at a time when many people have been left out of pocket from the pandemic because of the impact on their employment or business and when other costs are also rapidly rising.<\/p><p>Not only can our young people not afford rent; many are lucky if they can even find a place to rent.  Last week in Louth, for example, there were just 54 properties available to rent and this is in a county with a population in excess of 130,000 and growing.  We should spare a thought for the young retail worker, childcare worker or single mother operating within this<i>Hunger Games-<\/i>style rental market.  Imagine the feeling when they click on to a room-to-rent advertisement that has more than 2,000 views or when the prospective landlord tells them that he or she had 500-plus other inquiries about a room.  That is something I know everyone across this Chamber has experienced from representing their constituents day in, day out.  Even if a person is lucky enough to get a viewing, he or she will often be only one of many.  This desperation inevitably feeds into a diminution of standards.  It pushes up prices, as many have no choice but to accept the miserable offer that is available to them.  This is not some distant reality.<\/p> <p>In this very House, political staff - people working in our national Parliament - are forced to live at home with parents, unable to find even a room to rent at an affordable price.  This is apart from the skyrocketing cost of living and energy prices, which are making it nigh on impossible for many renters to get by each month.  It is no exaggeration when the head of Threshold, which is on the front line of our rental crisis, says many people are cutting back on other essential expenditure such as food or heat.  That is the reality of life at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I remember 2012 and 2013 very well.  The economy started to move again and housing demand in cities and large towns grew, but access to finance for builders hardly existed.  This is not that long ago.  Access to skilled labour was very limited, with many of those skilled tradespeople having to emigrate to find work because of the economic situation in this country.  Institutional investors were the only entities prepared to build to any scale at that point.  However, time does not stand still and the time is long since past for stronger regulation and fair taxation of these funds.  This is not 2012 or 2013.  The economic and financial situation is markedly different today.  Yet, from 2016 to 2020, we saw the then Government add fuel to the flames of an overheating housing and rental market by allowing institutional investors to operate with free rein and unencumbered, with no change worth talking about in terms of the tax or regulatory regime applied to these funds.  Last year alone, we saw large investors pay more than &euro;2 billion for nearly 5,000 private rented sector properties, with institutional buyers paying up to 32% more for each residence compared with the average price paid by household buyers.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of situations in my home town of Drogheda where young first-time buyers are competing with funds for fairly modest former local authority homes, for example, in which they might start a family before later, potentially, moving elsewhere.  They cannot compete because funds are buying up these properties <i>en masse<\/i>even before they are publicly advertised.  We know the average first-time buyer simply cannot compete with these funds but a question we do not ask ourselves often is why institutional investors are willing to pay so much above what might be the market rate.  In short, it is because they believe in Ireland's property market and have the confidence that, with the odds heavily stacked in their favour, it is a safe bet.  That requires some reflection.  We cannot allow institutional investors to continue to rake in virtually tax-free profits off the backs of workers in the real economy.<br\/><br\/>In successive budgets, the Labour Party has called for a package of measures to rein in cuckoo funds, including an increase in the dividend withholding tax to 33% on real estate investment trusts, REITs, and Irish real estate fund, IREFs, a minimum 10% stamp duty levy on bulk sales of apartments to private investors and an increase in stamp duty on non-residential property and &euro;1 million-plus purchases.  We have repeatedly called for the scrapping of capital gains tax, CGT, relief under section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which might once have served a purpose but is now costing the State more than &euro;500 million in tax expenditures.  This funding would not only help to stem the dominance of institutional investors but would also serve as an important source of additional capital funding to local authorities and approved housing bodies.<br\/><br\/>I turn briefly to the Labour Party amendment, which recognises the broader issue of taxation of rental income.  We know the majority of landlords - more than 85% - own only one or two properties.  These landlords, like institutional investors, must be, and are being, properly regulated and they also must be taxed fairly and consistently to ensure a fair playing field for all.  The Labour Party believes this income, like any other source of income, should be progressively taxed.  We cannot allow a situation to continue whereby the worker who pays the rent is liable for tax while the landlord who collects it has a different experience.  That is the reality of the situation at present.  There will be scaremongering in certain quarters that this would lead to a further exodus of landlords from the property market but there is no evidence whatsoever to back up that unsubstantiated claim.  When we look at the difference between mortgage repayments and average rental costs, it is clear the majority of landlords can well afford a modest tax on their rental income.  Indeed, it would be foolish of them to leave the market for tax reasons alone.<br\/><br\/>We need to see consistency.  As our amendment proposes, taxes on rental incomes should not be any less than the marginal tax rate levied on income from work.  That is the fairest, most consistent and most equitable thing to do.  The Labour Party fully supports the principles of this motion and we call on both Opposition and Government parties to accept our amendment to ensure full and fair taxation of rental income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500032#GG00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644950100,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I want to address a point the Minister for Finance made in his remarks.  I do not think I need to explain this to him.  I am sure he understands how social housing is costed in budget 2022, which he introduced in the House, in Housing for All and, in fact, in all the budgets he has introduced.  I would say he knows full well that the total capital cost of each social housing unit is not provided for in the budget and that the way the Government counts social housing costs is partially through capital payments and partially through low-cost loans.  Given that this is how the cost is provided for, it is a bit unfair and disingenuous to attack people on the Opposition benches for using the exact same costings he introduced in this House on several occasions.  He either does not understand the costings he introduced or this is a cheap political attack.  It is one or the other.<\/p><p>There are three factors that applied in Ireland until recently but are no longer the case.  Until recently, it was cheaper to rent than pay a mortgage.  That is no longer the case.  Until recently, it was cheaper to buy a new-build apartment than a new-build house.  That is no longer true.  It is not long since Ireland had above the average rate of home ownership in the European Union.  Now we are below that average.  In fact, it is not terribly long since home ownership rates were at 80% in Ireland, but they have decreased steadily over the past number of years, especially since Fine Gael came to office.  This is because of the policies that party is pursuing.<\/p><p>The growth in investment funds that has been facilitated and encouraged by the Government has gone hand in hand with rent increases of some 10% in the past year, according to the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report, increases in house prices in the past year of 14% and the financialisation of housing, which has seen the turning of homes into assets.  It has gone hand in hand with the creation of generation rent - an entire generation made up of people who cannot afford to buy their own homes even though they want to and who are being forced into renting.  It has gone hand in hand with the decline in home ownership I referenced.  This is particularly serious in an Irish context because our welfare state is very much based on home ownership.  It is where many of the supports went into over the years.  Our pension provision is based on the idea that the majority of people will own their own homes when they retire.  We are already seeing increasing numbers of pensioners at risk of homelessness and becoming homeless because they can no longer afford rents.  That will become a greater problem in the coming years.<\/p><p>I was particularly struck at the launching of Housing for All that the party leaders all talked about increasing home ownership.  However, looking at the targets in the plan and what the Government is doing in terms of attracting investment funds to buy up housing for rent tells a different story.  If Housing for All meets its targets, the only impact on home ownership will be a continued push to take ownership levels further down.  The plan is predicated on approximately one third of new homes going to owner-occupiers, with everything else going to support differing forms of rental provision, including a large number of institutional landlords.  The truth is that the current trajectory of Government policy is to continue to decrease home ownership.  Part of the drive behind investment by institutional landlords is that it goes hand in hand with build to rent provision.<\/p> <p>Look at what has happened to apartment standards and sizes in recent years.  In the past three years in Dublin alone, apartment sizes of new-build apartments have decreased by almost 20%.  Apartment sizes have gone from 89 sq. m in the second quarter of 2018 to just 62 sq. m in the second quarter of 2021.  That is the legacy of current policy.  Look at the housing needs assessment of Dublin City Council and the analysis carried out by KPMG on behalf of Dublin City Council.  They predict that of new households formed between 2023 and 2028 in Dublin city, and in the Minister's constituency, only 18% will be able to afford to rent.  Only 15% of those new households will be able to afford to buy a home.  Everybody else will require either social housing or subsidised rents and supports.  Therefore, almost 70% of new households will not be able to afford to meet their own housing needs.  Look at their year-on-year analysis of the numbers of people who will be able to afford their own rent without subsidies.  The numbers able to buy their own home will decrease year on year while, the report predicts, rents will go up and up.<br\/><br\/>The key feature in this is the uneven playing field we have.  Since the Celtic tiger collapsed, we rightly have had mortgage lending rules that are difficult and restrictive for people but there also is an advantage to them, in that they combat house price inflation.  On the other hand, while individuals and families have those restrictive rules, there is no such regulation or rules around investment funds.  That is an uneven playing field.  That is what creates this unfairness.  Clearly, we need a fair regulatory regime on this.  We need rules to be written that are fair and that are actually to the advantage of individuals and families, not to the advantage of investment funds.  That is what is missing here.  <br\/><br\/>It is worth looking at the yields on apartments, which are largely owned by investment funds.  The recent <i>daft.ie<\/i>report talks about yields on one-bedroom apartments in Dublin 1, in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, at 8%; in Dublin 10 at 10.3%; and in my constituency of Dublin 17 at 11.4%.  These are staggeringly high annual yields.  That is the kind of environment that has been created for institutional investment funds by the attractive tax treatment that has been put forward by the Government.  There is clearly no need for such levels of tax incentives and tax treatment, given such high yields.  With yields that high, individuals cannot compete.  Only one thing will happen as a result of yields that high, which is that the price of new-build homes will continue to go up and up.  <br\/><br\/>An excellent report was recently published by Professor Daniela Gabor and Professor Sebastian Kohl.  It was produced for the European Greens group in the European Parliament.  It is called &ldquo;My Home is an Asset Class: Housing Financialization in Europe&quot;.  While I am not used to quoting from Government parties in the D&aacute;il, or from their European groupings, this is an excellent report that is well worth quoting.  It states &quot;Europe&rsquo;s residential real estate has become an attractive asset class for investors worldwide, supported by a range of government policies that are ostensibly aimed at homeowners [but in fact push] up house prices and reduces affordability for citizens&quot;.  The report goes on to state &quot;Institutional ownership threatens to accelerate the trends unleashed by the financialization of housing: deeper financial markets have not substantively increased either aggregate home ownership or housing supply, but instead have inflated house prices&quot;.  All this sounds familiar in terms of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The authors also cite studies on both US and European cities, which &ldquo;identify negative consequences for housing affordability&rdquo;.  The report notes that a report from the EU Commission on financialisation of housing in seven European cities had a similar conclusion in terms of housing affordability.  It goes on to say that: &ldquo;institutional investors hold back the supply of urban land, thus increasing housing shortages and driving up prices, as documented in relation to Ireland&rdquo;, of course.  Importantly, they make the point in relation to the regulatory side of what happened after the financial collapse that &ldquo;substantive efforts to regulate global banking after the collapse of Lehman Brothers have not been matched by similar policies to regulate systemic institutional investors&rdquo;.  That is the key problem here.  There have rightly been tight controls over bank lending, which affect smaller builders and individual families who are trying to buy.  However, that tight regulation has not been matched for investment funds.  In fact, there has been no tight regulation at all.  It is that imbalance that needs to be corrected urgently.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500033#HH00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644950700,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The utterly hopeless and disastrous situation in which many working people find themselves when it comes to trying to do the basic thing of putting a roof over their heads was summed up this week for me by a young man who came into my clinic.  He works in retail and he is a low-paid worker.  He works in retail and he worked all during the pandemic.  His partner is also in low-pay, part-time employment.  Both of them are working.  They are both trying to get on in life.  They came into my clinic to tell me that both of them were being removed from the housing list, because they have gone over the income threshold.  Their combined income now goes very slightly over &euro;35,000 net.  They are now off the housing list, having been waiting on it for 11 years.<\/p><p>I want the Minister for Finance to think about this.  First, had the State discharged its obligation to them, as well as to the 5,000 other families in our area and we can also mention the approximately 100,000 across the country, they would now be in a council house.  Regardless of what happened to their income, their rent would increase related to their income.  They would not be thrown out of the council house because their income increased.  Ironically, however, because they do not have a home, and because the State failed in its duty for 11 years to provide them with the home to which they were entitled, now that their income has risen, they have been flung off the list.  Does the Minister get the injustice of that?  In addition, I received another text this week about a case that I have raised three times in this House, of a young woman who has also been thrown off the list.  She is working for CPL and is placed in the Government agency Tusla, where she works very vulnerable children.  She worked all the way during the pandemic.  She is in homeless accommodation with her daughter but has been thrown off the housing list.<\/p><p>By the way, when one is thrown off the housing list, one does not get the housing assistance payment, HAP, any more.  In my area, when that happens, one is told to go out and find private rented accommodation.  The average rents that are being charged in my area are now &euro;2,200.  The Minister can go on <i>daft.ie <\/i>and look for an apartment in my area.  It will be &euro;2,200.  Even if they were entitled to HAP, which now they are not, the maximum HAP rate is &euro;1,950, if one is homeless.  However, they do not even get that now because their income, apparently, is too high.  That is the cost at which the Minister&rsquo;s friends, the build-to-rent property investors, are delivering housing in my area.  By the way, there is a lot of building going on in D&uacute;n Laoghaire at the moment.  Are the prices going down?  No, they are going up. <\/p><p>The entire response of the Minister is based on a fantasy.  I remember Michael Noonan always used to accuse us on the left of fantasy economics.  Yet, who is peddling the fantasy?  Seriously?  When the private sector was delivering 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year in this country, treble the figure of what it is delivering now, did rents go down?  No, they went up.  Did property prices go down?  No, they went up.  These strategic housing developments, SHDs, are unfolding all over the city.  They built for profit, not built for need.  They are not built for that couple who came into my clinic.  They are built to make money for property investors who are charging &euro;2,200 per month.  Alternatively, if one wanted to purchase a house in my area, which is obviously a hopeless aspiration for a couple earning just over &euro;35,000, the average house prices being delivered by the Minister&rsquo;s friends in the private sector is &euro;560,000.  <\/p> <p>Maybe the Government's affordable housing scheme could help them, but it is capped at &euro;450,000.  When that was initially brought in, I thought it was a joke that &euro;450,000 was considered an affordable home.  A loan for 80% of that, which is what the shared equity scheme involves, would be &euro;360,000.  To get a loan from a bank for that amount, people would need to be earning between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000.  Clearly, the couple who came into my home, or the vast majority of ordinary workers, would not have a chance.  Now, however, it has gotten even worse because there are no houses for &euro;450,000, which was already unaffordable.  Killian Woods and the <i>Business Post<\/i>did a report on how this scheme might apply in Dublin.  Of the 50 developments they surveyed, only four had any homes that were on sale at below &euro;450,000.  In my area, there were zero.  What is the Government going to do about that fact?  These people are building for profit.<br\/><br\/>I missed the debate on &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; last night but I am glad we are finally debating socialism, even if it involves a load of people attacking socialists.  At least we are debating it.  Does the Minister of State know what socialism means?  Socialism means housing for need.  Capitalism means housing for greed.  Housing for greed delivers rents of &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,200 and affordable property prices of &euro;450,000 but in actuality, properties of &euro;560,000.  That is what housing for greed does.  That is what capitalism does.  Yet, the Government peddles the fantasy that eventually the rents and prices are going to fall.  They are not going to fall.  That is a total fantasy.  What do we need to do?  The Government says we could not possibly do anything without these investment funds.  I am scratching my head thinking about this because we managed to build houses in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s without investment funds, cuckoo funds and vulture funds.  How did we manage it then?  We did it, but the Government is telling us we cannot possibly do it now without those funds, and that we cannot introduce rent controls because to do so would terrify them.  They will all run away if we introduce real rent controls to make rent affordable.  Strangely enough, that has just been done in France.  A transition year student who was doing her placement in my office this week found that out for me.  Maybe the Government should look into that.  They have introduced rent controls and set maximum levels on a district-by-district basis, so people can only charge a certain amount for a property of a certain size.  Why can we not do that?  The property investors have not all run away from France.  The Government's arguments are threadbare and its policy is failing disastrously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500034#JJ00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644951300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>There was an astonishing ruling today by the Office of the Planning Regulator, whereby it blocked a city council from introducing some small degree of control on build-to-rent apartment blocks.  Dublin City Council had the temerity to insist that a percentage of apartments in build-to-rent developments be made available for sale.  Second, it sought to restrict the number of studio and one-bedroom apartments in any development.  Third, it sought to stipulate that build-to-rent developments should contain 100 units or more and be sufficiently large to include communal facilities.  This ruling is a win for big institutional corporate investors and is a blow to both communities and local democracy in this State.  How are ordinary people and communities meant to have a say in the planning process when a city development plan can be overruled by a planning regulator in this way?  Rulings like this give the owners of build-to-rent developments a free hand, which will result in the raising of rents.  There is no question about that.  It is happening already in Dublin and is beginning to happen in Cork.  In Cork, a developer was told by Deloitte that if they wanted their apartments to be viable - in other words, profitable - they would have to charge &euro;2,800 for a two-bedroom apartment.  In my community of Blackpool, a build-to-rent development has been given the go-ahead on the Redforge Road and an application has been submitted for Hewitt's Mill.  Rents that go anywhere near that level will raise the ceiling for rents in that community and there will be a tendency for rents more generally to rise in the area.  This does not mean we are against housing.  We are in favour of housing and apartments but it should be social housing and genuinely affordable housing, not rip-off rents at incredible rates that raise the ceiling and impoverish ordinary people while making huge profits for the vulture funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500035#KK00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1644951300,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzpatrick is sharing time with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500035#KK00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644951300,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak.  I thank the Deputies for bring this motion before the House.  I welcome the fact that we can discuss the housing crisis once more and discuss why we are in this position.  In my home town of Dundalk, the rental cost for a standard three-bedroom house is anywhere between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,600 per month.  To service a mortgage on that same property would be substantially less, but the fact of the matter is that the people paying rent of between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,600 per month are, in most instances, not able to get a mortgage for that same property.  This is one of the main reasons for the crisis we are in now.  How is that people who can afford to pay this rent cannot get a mortgage?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  I have spoken about this previously and about how it is unfair to those striving to get on the property ladder.<\/p>  <p>  We heard today how many new homes and apartments are being purchased in bulk by real estate investment trusts and institutional investors.  I agree that this is a problem.  They can outbid ordinary people for new properties and there is no doubt that they are driving the price of houses up.  They are also driving the cost of rent up, which is not acceptable.  The fact that real estate investment trusts and Irish real estate funds pay no corporation tax on rental income, or capital gains tax on the disposal of assets from their rental income business, is wrong.  Why is this allowed to happen?  As the motion states, it is having a detrimental effect on the Irish residential property market and the private rental sector.  These institutions should no longer have these tax advantages when competing with first-time buyers in the property market.  Their tax advantages should be abolished as a matter of urgency.  They are distorting rental and property markets to the detriment of families who are struggling very hard to buy their own house.<\/p>  <p>  A recent report by BNP Paribas Real Estate stated that 4,900 private rental sector properties were bulk purchased by investment funds in 2021, at an average of 32% above the asking price.  The value of these investments is estimated at &euro;2.27 billion and unless action is taken that is expected to grow even more in the coming years.  How can ordinary families and workers compete against these institutions?  I agree that legislation must be introduced to end the tax advantages and exemptions that have been granted to institutional investors, including real estate investment trusts and Irish real estate funds.  Why do these institutions have these advantages?  There is no justification for it.<\/p>  <p>  One area that we need to look at is vacant homes.  I have spoken many times on this issue and have repeatedly highlighted the issues in my home town of Dundalk.  You could walk down any residential area of Dundalk and find at least one vacant property.  How is this allowed?  These properties are generally in well-established residential areas where the necessary services are already in place.  I have previously highlighted the work of Louth County Council in bringing these vacant properties back into the housing stock.  I know from my dealings with the council that these schemes have been very successful and the only thing holding Louth County Council back is the lack of funding from Government.  Surely the Government can see the success of these schemes.  Would it not be better to fund these schemes, instead of affording unfair tax advantages to institutional investors and trusts?<\/p>  <p>  Recent data show that there are 44,905 residential and commercial properties lying vacant in the west, north west and Border areas like my constituency of Louth.  The Government&rsquo;s own targets state that we need 33,000 new homes on an annual basis.  Surely the way forward is to tackle these vacant homes first and bring them back to the market.  As I have already stated, many of these vacant homes are in established residential areas where services like schools, shops, medical facilities and so on already exist.  We need to focus on the issue of vacant homes, which will, in turn, dramatically help the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>People want to get onto the property ladder.<\/p> <p> I do not like what I am hearing in my constituency office.  I have people coming to my constituency office saying - it is a long time since I heard this previously - that they would be better off on social welfare.  I ask the Minister to not go down that road again.  A married couple coming to see me who are on the basic wage earn between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000.  Local authorities have not changed the limits relating to their housing lists for the past ten years.  It is totally unfair.  People are coming to me and saying that they are out working and want to work, that they are paying &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,600 a month on rent, that they are coming home with maybe &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 after they pay their taxes and the universal social charge and that they are left with nothing.  If they gave up work tomorrow morning, they would get &euro;1,320 in HAP towards the rent.  They would get medical cards.  They would get everything and it would only cost them &euro;25 per week for the house.  I ask the Minister not to forget the working people.  I am saying &euro;35,000, but what happens if they have children and have cr&egrave;che costs?  All I am asking the Minister is to look after middle-class people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500035#KK00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644951900,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The crisis in the cost of living for people across the country is at an extreme level.  Utility bills are going through the roof.  Many people are getting bills of &euro;600, &euro;700, &euro;800 or &euro;900.  Most families do not have that kind of cash lying around for such bills and some are getting into debt in order to try to cover the cost of them.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people who have contacted my offices across my constituency of Meath West and Meath in general over the past couple of weeks and detailed the increases in their bills is incredible.  One household saw their gas bill go from &euro;91 to &euro;206 from one billing period to the next.  Another's Energia bill went from &euro;156 to &euro;342.  A gas bill went from &euro;280 to &euro;620.  Another family said that they were paying &euro;864 for electricity having previously been charged &euro;209.  For one family, a bill for &euro;1,200 came in for gas and electricity at a single moment.  Those types of bill increases put the so-called supports that the Government has come up with in the ha'penny place.<\/p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that the spending power of someone on the average income in the State has fallen by &euro;2,000 in the space of a year.  That is a significant reduction.  When you compare that reduction in salary for members of the general public with the largesse of the Government in giving a &euro;100,000 increase to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, it shows how we have a tale of two countries.  There are two parallel experiences and existences happening under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been great in saying that these price increases are as a result of external issues, but the truth is that Ireland is now the sixth most expensive state in the EU.  Dublin is the third most expensive city in the whole of Europe.  Currently, only two Swiss cities out-cost Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  We have a cost-of-living crisis that is affecting so many things.  It is affecting families' ability to pay their bills and to live, but it is also affecting this country's ability to compete internationally.  If the cost of living goes out of control with runaway inflation rates in this State, what you will see is our inability to compete with other European countries and other locations internationally for jobs and investment in the future.  It is working against our long-term economic interests as well.  The issue is certainly getting worse.<\/p>  <p>  The problem I have is that the Government has control over a number of levers but it refuses to operate them.  I have ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on a dozen occasions why he will not find a tax for houses that are vacant in the State and, in committee and here in the D&aacute;il, he has said that he wants to find out more about it and does not want to rush into doing anything.  There could be many other reasons.  What the Minister has displayed is a complete lack of urgency at time when urgency is required.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of childcare is hammering so many families at present.  It is equivalent to a second mortgage.  I have been talking to people in the industry today who tell me that the Minister and the Taoiseach are going out in public saying that there will be a cap on childcare prices in the State when, in fact, they still have not come to any negotiation or deal with the childcare sector.  They have not told the childcare sector what level of income it will receive from the State and yet they are publicly saying that the childcare sector will not increase the cost of childcare in the future.  We are still significantly behind other European countries with the level of investment that we are making in childcare.<\/p>  <p>  Then, of course, you have the issue of the litre of fuel at the pumps.  Sixty per cent of the price of fuel goes into the Government's pocket.  We have a Government which is introducing carbon taxes on a population years in advance and which is completely oblivious to the conditions that those people will be experiencing at that time, and yet it will add that tax - one of the blindest and most blunt taxes that I have ever seen - to the cost-of-living crisis in May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500036#LL00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1644951900,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Last week's announcement by the Government of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party showed that it is alarmingly out of touch with people in this country.  It is astonishing to think the Government could go ahead with so-called cuts to help people and still be so blind to the real crisis whereby we see working families in such a mess.  People cannot pay their rent and are struggling to pay their mortgages.  Others are struggling to put food on the table.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have left most families with a clear choice each day between opting for either food or heat.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, with Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour and others, voted to bring in the carbon tax only a few months ago, even though the Rural Independent Group pleaded with them not to.  Boy, what a mess they have created for ordinary families who are trying to work their way out of the crisis we are in at the moment with no help from a struggling Government.  Two hundred euro off an electricity bill is as much as most families will get.  The rest is tied up in a dream announcement that will have little to do with the ordinary families that I know.<\/p>  <p>  The 20% reduction in public transport fares will suit the Green Party to perfection because those who use the DART, the train and Luas in Dublin city and its surrounds will benefit the most, as will anyone who uses Bus &Eacute;ireann's services.  Private bus operators do not receive any State intervention.  They employ people who drive buses the length and breadth of this island - many of them from west Cork to Cork city daily.  These operators will not get one brown cent from the 20% reduction.  For many of them, this will mean laying off staff because this blind Government is giving an already subsidised bus service 20% more in subsidies and the private bus operator will get nothing.  Surely the competition regulator has to get involved.  To be honest, if they were all asleep, you could not write up this stuff.  People who are paying massive rents, businesspeople with lorries and buses and contractors cannot wait to drag the Government to the ballot box as soon as possible in order to get rid of it.<\/p>  <p>  I will just add that people who cannot get on the property ladder for one reason or another feel rightly let down after last week's announcements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500036#LL00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1644951900,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in, especially Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Doherty, for the work that they put in to this matter.

The Government is doing nothing whatsoever, in my humble opinion, to sort it, and I will tell the Minister why.  First of all, however, I will declare an interest in all of these type of matters, as I always do.<\/p>  <p>  When you look at the way the culture has been made to suit the massive institutional investors that come in from abroad, the fact that they are able to shelter so much money from tax and that they can buy up hundreds and hundreds of units at the same time, of course, that is not good at the end of the day for the person who is renting.  That is one of the contributing factors to such increased rents and it is why it is so expensive for people who want to get on the property ladder and buy, whether it is an apartment or a house.  This is not just the case in Dublin.  As already stated, it is a countrywide problem.  There is more to Ireland and more to the housing crisis than what is happening on this side of the Red Cow roundabout.  We live outside the Red Cow roundabout - we are entitled to live there - and we have a housing crisis.  We in County Kerry have a housing crisis.  Every clinic that I go to, and every day and every hour that we are picking up the phone, it is people who are in trouble.  It is the people themselves, the mothers, the fathers and the grandparents asking what are we going to do.<\/p> <p>I do not know what in the name of God has happened this month, but the number of people who have been given notice to leave their homes has increased.  I checked every one of them and some of them fall through the net and they are not done properly, but the majority of the notifications telling perhaps a young couple that they have to leave their home, are done properly.

Now the red carpet is out for institutional investors that can buy streets and housing estates while we persecute our own people.  Our duty in here as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, messengers of the people, is to represent the people and to speak up for them.  The Government has lost sight of the ordinary people.  It does not seem to care about them, and it does not seem to understand anybody.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the staff in my office and in all offices that are overrun with people coming in with all kinds of issues.  The HAP was a disaster.  We now have billions spent on HAP and we have no houses.  It was stupid policy, yet we continue with it.<\/p>  <p>  Spending power is way down.  This is the sixth most expensive country in Europe.  How come Sweden could bring down the price of food to 2018 levels, yet we cannot do anything?

It was laughable last week to hear about the 20% reduction in public transport fares.  That is lovely for the people who have the Luas and DART, but what about the people out in the country?

We know that people are struggling, in particular working families, and finding it very hard to make ends meet.  I have no intention of engaging in a game whereby any or all private investment in the housing market is automatically a bad thing, because I do not feel that is the case.  That is an absurd position to adopt.  What I will say, however, is that like in so many areas, it is a matter of proportion and balance.  For example, we should be rewarding and helping the small contractor and the local builder who want to tender for contracts with a local authority so that they can provide homes for their communities and build up their workforce, thereby offering much valuable local employment.  That is an issue we must get to grips with: how we allow the small contractor who can provide work and who can build houses to effectively tender for State contracts.  These people have their roots in communities, and they have something valuable to offer in terms of the local economy and much-needed employment.<\/p>  <p>  It is evident that there is a major power imbalance.  Unfortunately, all the power is on one side.  In many ways, the large institutional investors have us over a barrel.  They know we have a housing crisis.  The State is slow to build and so they come in offering manna from heaven in the form of much needed homes, but then the prices are simply put of the reach of so many potential homeowners, young couples and ordinary workers.

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for facilitating this very important debate.  I agree with the motion, but I have a different angle I wish to raise.  We are talking about tackling the cost of living, which has gone up exorbitantly because of the cost of fuel - diesel, petrol and home heating oil.  We know that this has gone up worldwide, but the tax take is bigger.  The Minister has left the Chamber.  The tax take has increased.  I again ask the Government to forgo the increase and to give it back, so as to give working people a chance.  People in rural Ireland have to travel to work and they must have a car in order to do that.  Regardless of what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, thinks about bicycles and other things, people need cars in order to get to work.  Transport costs have gone through the roof.  No heed has been given to the lorry men and the plight they are in.  The diesel rebate should be increased, and the Government should forgo the extra tax.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Government trying to do but to raise the carbon tax again?  Diesel costs for farmers have doubled.  Fertiliser costs have trebled.  Because the Greens hate the farmers, they will do nothing for them.

This issue is not new.  This crisis has been escalating year-on-year.  It is not a crisis manufactured by any Opposition party.  It is real crisis for families, individuals, young people and pensioners.  It is a crisis that affects urban and rural areas alike.<\/p>  <p>  Being able to call somewhere home is essential to ensure a sense of security that is fundamental to all of us as human beings.  Being able to open, step through and close our front door behind us gives those of us in that position a real sense of belonging, a sense of place, the feeling that we are at home.  The word \"home\" is so powerful and it means so much in so many different ways.  As a person or family without a home, either one you own or rent with some decent level of certainty around the tenancy, you are just adrift.  You have no anchor.  All the other things we talk about in this place, whether it is employment, education or community are all irrelevant if you do not have a home.  That is why we speak of a crisis.<\/p>  <p>  At one time, this crisis was much more acute in the cities and urban areas.  If you are a person without a home, however, it is acute no matter where you live.<\/p>  <p>Certainly, the numbers were greater.  That is no longer the case.  If we look at the facts, we can see that, excluding the cities, the average rent across the country in the last year stands at just over &euro;1,100 per month, an increase of 11.9% on the previous year.  In the west, in counties like Roscommon, Leitrim and Mayo, rents rose by 20% on a year-on-year basis, which is 8% more than the average.  Indeed, four of the five largest annual increases in the country were in the western region in quarter 2 of 2021, with increases of 21% in Leitrim, 17% in Clare and Donegal and 50% in Sligo.  That is for increases in the cost of renting a home but if we look at the cost of buying a home - house prices - what we see is that the move away from the larger urban centres has had a very significant impact.  If we look at median house prices, the percentage change from 2019 to 2021 is 11% in Donegal, 16% in Leitrim, 8% in Sligo and 14% in Roscommon.<\/p> <p> I could be giving statistics and figures all day long but that does not give a real picture of what it is like for people who are trying to buy a home.  Like many others in this Chamber, I get emails and calls all of the time from people at the end of their tether because they cannot find a place to rent or to live.  The Government tells us that the problem is one of supply, and there is a lot of truth in that.  However, if we look at completions in the last three years, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we see that in the western region, the numbers are paltry, from just over 2,600 completions in 2019 to 2,758 in 2021.  In my own county of Sligo, the completions were 118 in 2019 and 143 in 2021, a minuscule increase.  I know we have Covid and that has obviously impacted on the number of completions but the Government tells us that this is a problem of supply.  It is the Government and it has to find a solution to that.<\/p> <p> Many of the proposals in this motion will help to start addressing the crisis that we are speaking of here.  I want to focus in particular on one, the last proposal, which asks that the Government would: &ldquo;provide additional capital funding to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to forward purchase such developments for the provision of social, affordable rental and affordable purchase homes, given some developments require forward purchase agreements to ensure their viability and delivery.&rdquo;  To me, this is a very important issue because the upfront costs of developing and building homes can be very significant.  One of the things we could do, for example, is to look to the Housing Agency to fund the upfront costs and provide the mezzanine funding that is necessary to local authorities and to approved housing bodies.  I also believe we should look to the same Housing Agency to lend money for what I would call genuine projects, for the building of homes where the outcome would ensure affordable homes, because there is no point in Government money fuelling an increase in the cost of homes.  We have a Housing Agency that is managing the mica redress scheme.  Why do we not task that agency with managing what I am speaking of here, that is, the upfront costs to local authorities and approved housing bodies, or to local builders and developers who will provide local homes in local areas, as well as local employment?  That proposal perhaps needs some refinement but I think it is a very valuable one because it deals with the reality of building homes.<\/p> <p> During Covid, we did a lot of good things.  The Government did a lot of good things, for example, it guaranteed businesses.  We guaranteed the banks during the crash but what we are talking about today is bread and butter stuff.  My question is this: why can we not guarantee housing?<\/p> <p> My final point again comes back to local authorities.  We know that local authorities built houses 20 or, certainly, 30, 40 and 50 years ago.  Unfortunately, because policy changes, some of the expertise has been lost and it will take time to get that back.  However, there is still a lot that could be done, for example, with derelict homes in towns and villages.  I know there are grants for individuals to perhaps do up these houses but why not resource local authorities to help to deliver local housing in this way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500037#MM02100","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644953100,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I have listened carefully to many of the Deputies opposite in their well-intentioned arguments on the increase in the cost of living.  As a rural Deputy in Longford-Westmeath, I too, through my weekly clinics, meet very vulnerable people every single week that I attend D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and right through the year, people who are trying to find a solution, who are looking for help and who want support at a very vulnerable time in their lives.  One thing I want to make very clear from the outset is that I am meeting vulnerable people in very difficult situations and I am doing my best, as part of a Government response, to try to provide sustainable and genuine solutions for those people.<\/p>  <p>  If we look in broad terms at where we are currently, with a new plan to deliver large-scale residential housing for our citizens right across the State out to 2030, we have seen small, incremental progress.  However, when we look at the big numbers since 2016, we have increased the delivery of social homes tenfold.  Those are real solutions for people right across the State.  That is coming from an extremely low base, where two thirds of construction sectors workers had left the State, where our economy was spending 50% more than it took in as income and where we had 3,000 ghost estates, with the Department trying to implement remedial schemes up and down the country.  We have moved to a position where we have a very clear, plan-led direction for our country, and where we have a new national planning framework to deliver and unlock the potential right across our State for all of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the housing plan, &euro;4 billion in multi-annual funding is guaranteed to give certainty to the marketplace and the State in delivering viable solutions.  We see the large-scale increase in affordable purchase and also the cost rental model providing certainty for citizens at 25% below market rent.  Those are real solutions.  In this city over the last four years, there has been a 33% reduction in the social housing list.  That is progress.  I know many will criticise the pace and it should be done faster, but given the circumstances the Government is operating in and the huge challenges, it is making progress.  When we look at the commencement notices, we can see 31,000 units are now commenced, which is a huge, 42% improvement on 2020.  Again, those are real solutions for families up and down this State and will provide huge hope.<\/p>  <p>  In my locality, when I see people coming in and out of my clinic, I can point to four or five individual sites in my town, with more than 100 units being delivered on them.  That is hope for people because the diggers and the tradespeople are there, delivering those houses, which are coming.<\/p> <p>I know it is difficult to get to that space but they are being delivered at scale.<\/p> <p> There is a cross-Government approach in the way we have supported the most vulnerable in our society to defray the cost of living increases.  That goes from increasing the State pension at a time when inflation was not as high to more targeted measures like the fuel allowance payment and our drugs payment scheme.  These support people on the front line who need that support most.  On a broader base, people who are struggling like two-income families or middle-income earners have the energy payment, as well as the reductions that were taken from our standard rate cut-off point and the increase in tax credits over the budgetary process.  The party I am a member of increased the minimum wage by 37% in recent years and we have put a priority on taking 35% of workers out of the tax net because they are the most vulnerable people in our society.  The party I am a member of saw the deprivation index reduce because we are supporting the most vulnerable in our society with those targeted measures.  We do so by increasing housing supply, by supporting those in most need through the measures I referenced and by ensuring that those in a progressive tax system who do not earn as much do not pay any tax.  We saw the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and many people quote different figures but it said in black and white that the effective tax rate for high net worth individuals was over 40%.  When I was a remember of the Committee of Public Accounts that was clear on page 249 of that report and I will not forget it.  When one hears discourse in this House sometimes one would think there is a magic number of people earning huge and colossal amounts of money at the expense of the State and paying no tax.  The research and evidence do not back up that and one can see that in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.<\/p> <p> As we try to ensure people have real solutions, we see other parties promise and talk about what they will do but if one looks at what they said and promised compared with what this Government did, we have exceeded much of what the party opposite in particular said it would do.  In particular, I refer to its target of delivering 36,500 houses from its 2016 manifesto and the Government delivered 39,000 houses a year earlier.  I look at our analysis and I see 16,000 Momma and Poppa landlords exiting the marketplace since 2016.  Then I look at Sinn F&eacute;in seeking to put a &euro;400 second home charge on those people who are also trying to make ends meet and deliver sustainable rental accommodation.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s response to a market in crisis is to tax it more.  When I look at housing developments there are objections from Sinn F&eacute;in time after time.  We saw public houses proposed to be exclusively built on public land in Kilbride Lodge in Wicklow objected to by Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is at a time when we are trying to prioritise employment and we saw how the Minister for Finance underwrote employment and supported people throughout the crisis, be it through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and rates waivers.  He did so to ensure that people did not lose that vital link with their jobs.  At that time Sinn F&eacute;in was proposing to increase employer&rsquo;s PRSI and put a greater tax on people being employed and in turn no risk assessment had been carried out for that.  At a time when the Government was spending billions trying to maintain that link between the employer and the employee, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s response was to tax them more.<\/p> <p> I refer to the various mechanisms that are being proposed opposite such as increasing stamp duty by 66%.  If a small business owner is expanding then how will that fare with him or her trying to get into a new premises or expand the business?  If a farmer is trying to consolidate his or her holdings then how will that affect him or her?  Not everyone qualifies for the minority of reliefs one sometimes hears referenced by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Again, people have to be supported in the best use of public resources and when one is in government decisions have to be made.  Decisions are difficult because one is trying to balance competing interests every day of the week and that is something I do not take lightly.  I am privileged and humbled to be part of a Government that is doing its best.  I know the background I come from and the people I meet week-in and week-out at my clinic and I can genuinely say that every day in government one does one&rsquo;s best to take the best decisions for the best interests of the public.  In the measures we have brought in that I have referenced we are doing our best to do that.<\/p> <p> We should never take away hope in a debate because the numbers back up the fact that we are at a huge capacity in our construction sector.  We can see that we are getting more apprenticeships in through the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, in further and higher education.  We can also see that the output in completions forecasted by the Central Bank in the coming years will exceed 30,000 and that we will get to that figure of 33,000 that the ESRI says we need.  Hopefully we will exceed that and we are working so hard to deliver that across all tenures.  Members can come into this House and identify many different problems but those on the other benches are trying to do their best to meet one of the biggest challenges we have ever faced in housing, coming from a position when all our local authorities were saturated in debt less than a decade ago.  The measures we are bringing in include bringing vacant properities back into use.  Our zoned land and capture sharing taxes are potentially coming down the line shortly, which signals to the marketplace that we mean business in delivering large numbers of homes for the most vulnerable and for every part of society.  It has to be a broad base that delivers homes all across our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500038#NN00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644953700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I want to mention the issues of rents, which loads of Members have mentioned.  I do not like to say it is at crisis point because it has nearly gone beyond that at this stage.  In the two clinics I run, one in Kilkenny and one in Bagenalstown in Carlow, I had an individual in each, one of whom is due to be out of his or her property this Saturday and the other of whom is due to be out in the next two months.  There is no hope of finding anything at all for them and it is so difficult.  It is even difficult to know what to say to people in this situation because I ask them if they have applied to various landlords about anything that might be coming up and everybody is applying for everything.  At the moment there are ten properties in Kilkenny and nine in Carlow.  Then there is the situation with HAP.  For example, if you are single you are entitled to &euro;490 of HAP and you do not have a hope of reaching some of these properties listed at between &euro;1,100 and &euro;1,500 in some cases.  We really need urgency on rental properties.  I also want to make the point that not everyone qualifies for HAP.  A lot of people are in real difficulty and do not qualify for any supports.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention the fuel allowance because this is a major issue with the cost of living.  We have seen so many people, particularly elderly people, who should not be worried about the cost of heating and they are under pressure.  I also want to mention that a lot of people do not qualify for fuel allowance.  One of our suggestions was to include people who are on the working family payment in the fuel allowance and we need to look at that.  In the longer term we need to look at the issue of retrofitting, which I know we will debate later this week in the Chamber.  I want to make the point that a lot of the grants are not fit for purpose and that people do not have the balance of the funds.  The SEAI has a waiting list of over a year, which is crazy.  There is no common sense in some of the schemes and they really need to be fit for purpose.  Those are the kind of schemes we should be looking at if we want to reduce costs for people in the long term and if we are serious about the climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500039#OO00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1644953700,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The average rent in my home city of Limerick is &euro;1,407 per month, that is if one is lucky enough to be able to find a property.

I do not know who can afford that in Limerick and there was only one house available for less than &euro;2,000 per month so we have priced working families out of the market.  They have nowhere to go because they earn too much to get social supports and the Government refused to increase the income limit so people can access social supports, whether that be council housing or HAP.  There is supposed to be a review ongoing in the Department but any official I have spoken to tells me there is no review ongoing or no target date for when that will be done.<\/p><p>The Minister of State talked about addressing the cost of living and about the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>The minimum wage increased by 3% this year but with inflation running at 5%, that represents a reduction in real terms.  The Government has not done anything to help those on the lowest levels of pay.  The extreme cost of rent and house purchase has not come out of the blue but is the result of failure after failure on the part of this Government and its predecessors.  The refrain we hear most often from Government parties is that housing is not an issue that can be fixed overnight but if we stick with them, they will deliver.  We have had 11 years of failure in relation to the cost of housing by these parties and it is time to realise that they cannot and will not fix this crisis which is of their own making.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday the Minister's colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il launched a social media attack on Sinn F&eacute;in and its housing policies that was fairly pathetic.  Let us get something straight here.  The Minister's colleague in government, who is a constituency colleague of mine, Deputy O'Dea, was quoted in the <i>Sunday Times<\/i>, when talking about investing in social housing and Government incentives, as saying &quot;In this world, everybody has to make a few bob, you know&quot;.  He suggested that there was money to be made, while Irish citizens were locked out of the housing and rental markets.  I am sure Fianna F&aacute;il will produce some more of its pathetic little graphics for social media to suggest that Sinn F&eacute;in is the problem when it comes to housing which is, of course, nonsense.  Let us be clear on a few points.  The Government has not delivered affordable homes to rent or to buy on the scale that is needed.  Under this Government, rents and house prices have increased and working families are priced out of the market.  The tax advantages and exemptions for investment funds were not gifted by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The rich got richer and made, as Deputy O'Dea would say, more than a few bob.  It was on this Government's watch that 4,900 private rental sector properties were bulk-purchased by investment funds in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500039#OO00300","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644954300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>In the past hour we have heard the usual excuses and well-versed defences from Government, something that has not changed in the years that I have been raising this issue.  Any investors, cuckoo funds or vulture funds listening to the contributions from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will be happy enough because they know that their lads in Fine Gael have their back.  Nothing is going to change, according to the two lads here.  The Minister for Finance tried in his speech to convince us all that the vulture funds are poor souls, trying to do their best for the ordinary renters and home purchasers out there and that maybe we should shed a tear for them.  The reality, however, is very different.  The fact that the Minister did not even talk about the fact they do not pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax shows that there is no defence for the sweetheart deals he and his colleagues have given to these funds over the last few years.<\/p>  <p>  One of the myths peddled by the Government, and reiterated by the Minister this evening, is that these funds finance residential developments that would otherwise not be built.  This is not the first time we have heard this.  The Minister has said it numerous times previously.  Indeed, his party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, told the D&aacute;il that the role of these funds was to finance the construction of developments which would not otherwise have been built because such developments were not able to get funding from banks.  That is what he told this House but that is blatantly untrue.  As the estate agents Hooke and MacDonald noted in a recent report on residential investment in Dublin, very few institutional investors have funded the development and construction of properties they bought in the Irish market.  That is the truth and not what Deputies Donohoe and Varadkar have said, and not the spin that is coming from this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Last week a report from BNP Paribas found that investment funds bulk-purchased 4,900 properties in 2021 alone and they paid 32% more than the average asking price.  They paid 32% more because they believe that rents are going to stay at current levels.  Those same properties are now being rented out at extortionate prices.  The prices are extortionate; there is no other word for it but the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, wants us to shed a tear at the prospect that the funds might have to pay &euro;400 more, even though they do not pay any tax whatsoever.  These funds have more fire power than ordinary workers and families.  If the Government cares, it must do something about it.  They have more fire power and the Government is actually making things worse.  It has given them even more fire power because its policies gives them a greater advantage over workers and families and that is the blunt truth.  There is no hiding place from this.  <\/p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, which is wholly owned by the Minister for Finance, was set up by the Government to finance residential development.  It has provided &euro;264 million in funding for five developments comprising a total of 916 units.  Those units have been or will be bought up by these same funds.  Taxpayer funding of more than a quarter of a billion euro is being provided to develop homes but those homes will never come on the market.  The funds buy them right from the start.  The funds agree to buy them and charge eye-watering rents of &euro;2,000 plus but the Minister for Finance, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, tells them that they do not have to pay one cent of tax on the millions of euro they get in rental income.  Any other company or individual would have to pay tax on that rental income but the Government has decided that these funds should have special privileges.  They can boost up rental and house prices.  They can pay 32% over the asking prices, thus pushing up house prices for everybody else.  Then the Government tries to convince us that ordinary renters, workers and families are at the heart and core of its housing policies but nothing could be further from the truth.   The Government's policies only serve one purpose and that is to support the funds.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2020 the Dublin-based investment advisory firm Gillen Markets wrote a note to international investors on our housing market and why it is broken.  It said that current housing policy has benefited both institutions and developers at the expense of individual buyers.  The aim of institutions is to maximise rental income from their properties and developers are designing apartment blocks to maximise this income for the institutions rather than aiming to meet the needs of society.  It went on to say that the current high level of house prices and rents in Ireland in the residential property market has been driven to a significant extent by Government housing policies aimed at attracting institutional investors into the market.  Their gradual move into the market has contributed to higher housing prices and higher rents.  These are not my words or the words of Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is the market talking to itself, exposing what Fine Gael in government has done over the last ten years.  Successive Governments have rolled out the red carpet to funds, given them more fire power and allowed them to push up prices for ordinary people but the public can no longer stand for it.  What is happening is crazy.  People are pleading with the Government to take away the advantage the funds enjoy.  Why under God would the Government allow them to outbid ordinary families who are in desperate need of homes?  Why is it allowing them to do it?  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State addressed that question in their ten minute contributions.  Not once did they justify allowing them to pay no tax, to outbid ordinary people and to push up rents in this city across the board.<\/p>  <p>  This motion should be supported by anybody who has the interests of workers and families at heart rather than the profits of these funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500040#PP00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644954300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954300,"counter":382,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500040#PP00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>What happens to the amendment from the Labour Party?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500040#PP00500","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954300,"counter":384,"content":"<p>It cannot be disposed of until we dispose of the amendment from the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500040#PP00600","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954300,"counter":385,"content":"<p>When will that happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500040#PP00700","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954300,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500040#PP00800","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1644954900,"counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","time":1644954900,"counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ00200"},{"type":"question","time":1644954900,"counter":389,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[7839\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the waiting list plan will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954900,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I think we all accept that waiting lists are dangerously high.

The pressure is still not acceptable in Limerick or in Galway and other hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy's core point on waiting lists.  I made similar contributions in this House from where the Deputy is sitting.  Waiting lists have not been acceptable for too long.  The question is what we are doing about it.  I have allocated &euro;350 million this year specifically for waiting lists.  Obviously, it will take much more money to build the permanent capacity in the public system because we need a public health service that can deal with total demand for the country.  We want a single-tier system.  At the same time, we must get help for all of the men, women and children who are waiting.  That is what the &euro;350 million plan is for.

It is the same thing that causes the problem in our emergency departments.  We do not have enough admission beds in hospitals.  Two years ago, in budget 2021, the Minister committed to bring 1,147 additional in-patient acute beds into the system.  Some 400 of those have not yet been delivered.  Hospitals do not have the beds to admit patients in the numbers they need.  That creates problems in our emergency departments.  We do not have the enhanced community care that we were promised along with integrated care and step-down beds in communities.  This causes late discharges as hospitals cannot discharge people into the community as they do not have the beds.  That is a second problem.  The third problem is GP capacity, which we will deal with later.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, we are beginning to see people waiting for access to a GP.  Will we get to a point where we have waiting lists to see a GP?  People are waiting not just days but sometimes weeks for appointments.  These are the problems.  When people are unable to access a GP in hours or out of hours they have no choice but to attend our emergency departments.  When we have emergency departments overflowing it is a symptom of everything going wrong at the same time.  The Minister should convene a meeting of the task force, get the stakeholders together and put all the options on the table, including leveraging capacity in the private sector, because this is so urgent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ00800","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954900,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I largely agree with the Deputy.  I had a high-level meeting with the HSE on exactly this matter in the past few days.  There are still some issues related to Covid.  One point the HSE raised with me was that about half the nursing homes have Covid outbreaks.  We have a protocol in place whereby one must wait 28 days, two full cycles of Covid, before anyone can be discharged.  As the Deputy rightly said, there are pressures on discharges.  We funded an extra 2.7 million home care hours for last year, which have been carried forward into this year.  However, the issue at the moment is not funding but making sure there are people who can deliver the services.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct about discharges, more community beds and how we need the nursing homes to be free of Covid in order that people can be discharged.  Then there is the issue of home care packages.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has done huge work on reducing waiting lists for those looking for home care packages.  As the Deputy says, this is end to end, from prevention, GPs, community services and frailty intervention and community intervention teams to the availability of multiple pathways in emergency departments, diagnostics, including acute diagnostics and GP access to diagnostics, acute beds and discharge options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ00900","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","time":1644954900,"counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ01050"},{"type":"question","time":1644954900,"counter":397,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[7729\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500041#QQ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the detailed breakdown of child and adolescent orthopaedic and related surgeries waiting lists; his plans to tackle those waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1644954900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Continuing on the theme of waiting lists, my question relates to the waiting lists for child and adolescent orthopaedic surgeries.

Last week I convened a meeting of the three hospitals involved, namely, Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh.  I met the surgeons, hospital managers and the director of nursing.

I then visited Cappagh on Friday, including Cappagh Kids.  The hospital has really ambitious, interesting proposals for children and adolescent, and adult services in the from of high-dependency units, more beds and so forth.  We have what I think is a very ambitious but very good plan in place.

I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and indeed the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte on the radio.  They gave very credible accounts as to how they come up with their budgets and the work that would go into it, which I believe.  However, does the Minister now have faith that when ambitious plans for this area or any other in health are put together and he provides the money, it will actually be delivered and will go into the HDUs and the staffing levels?  This is not a &quot;Gotcha&quot; question.  It is a very serious question because whatever the merits of how that article came to be, namely a secret recording and all the rest which is not great, the fact is it was presented to us.

We have operating theatres that are open between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, but not earlier or later and not on Saturdays or Sundays.  There is much opportunity there.  The HSE worked with Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and with Cappagh and have come back to me with a very ambitious plan.  I will shortly be able to share the details.  Will they achieve everything set out in the plan, even if it is fully-funded?  They are going to try their very best but in a conversation I am having with their surgeons, they are saying that with healthcare, especially at the moment, it is very hard to give definitive guarantees on all of this.  Emergency cases come in, theatres get used up, and maybe the neurosurgeons need the theatre that was meant to have a full list of paediatric orthopaedics that day.  As such, there is a genuine nervousness and caution when CHI is giving me these figures.

I pay tribute to GPs and everyone working with them in general practice for the extraordinary work they have done through the pandemic and of late in stepping up around the Christmas period for the booster vaccines.  They have been absolutely incredible.<\/p>  <p>  There are capacity challenges facing general practice.  There are access challenges for patients.  As the Deputy rightly said, it can be quite variable in different parts of the country.

Steps we have taken recently in co-operation with general practice include the chronic disease management programme, which is going very well, and GP direct access, which is going very well and is helping with a lot of access.  They are having a transformative impact in the delivery of quality care in the community that general practice is able to provide.

Let us all agree this is a major issue that needs to be dealt with.  What do we do?  We need a very significant increase in training places.

A serious gender analysis is required.  Certainly, the conversations I have had with GPs suggest the system simply does not work structurally for many women.  There are very serious issues with access, especially GMS access.  It is more serious in lower income areas where it is a real problem so we need to look at how a future GMS contract interacts with the future of general practice.  We moved training to the ICGP.

There is a dedicated resource looking at that issue.  <\/p>  <p>  An issue the Deputy has raised many times, where there has not been sufficient progress, is eHealth in the community.

They have already been asked that in various surveys and it is not about money.  Everybody wants a decent income, but GPs do not want to be businesspeople.

Interestingly, some of the older GPs I have spoken to who might be in more rural areas are quite happy with their situation.  They want to keep going, but there is flexibility they do not have, such as splitting GMS lists.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy talked about the business model.  There is a real issue with the GMS.  GPs say to me that in many cases they lose money on the GMS list.  It is income that comes into the practice, but where they make their profit and get to pay their wages is on private patients.  If we are moving towards more and more people being able to access GP care for free, that is something we will have to deal with.  If we are asking GPs to come into areas, which we must, where the majority of patients are GMS patients, we need to think about that.

The National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is Ireland's major centre for elective orthopaedic surgery and through the wonderful Cappagh Kids initiative, the national orthopaedic hospital provides additional capacity for the treatment of some of the more routine paediatric orthopaedic patients, including some routine scoliosis procedures.  Using the capacity provided by Cappagh first and foremost means children are treated there, but it also means that Children's Health Ireland, CHI, is freeing up space so that the more complex orthopaedic procedures, including spinal fusion, can be carried out centrally at the CHI sites.  Total funding of &euro;1.65 million was provided to Cappagh last year.  Funding for this year will be encompassed within the waiting list action plan.  Cappagh estimates it can do approximately 640 non-complex surgeries and can treat another 340 inpatient and day cases.  There is an awful lot of opportunity there.<\/p>  <p>  Additional theatre capacity in Cappagh commenced in April last year for day case surgery.  CHI has advised that this should result in the positive impact of a reduction in the waiting times for general paediatric orthopaedics which, quite frankly, are too long.  This year, CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, day case and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.  Last week, I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh, along with senior management from the three hospitals and the HSE.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss this draft paediatric orthopaedic waiting list plan to make sure it is sufficiently ambitious and that it does what we all need it to do, which is to provide care to these children who have been waiting for too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500045#UU00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1644957300,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am aware that some funding has been channelled towards Cappagh and CHI in recent times.  The families of children in this situation have been in touch with me, as I am sure they have been with the Minister and many others in this House.  Their number one priority is to change the situation being faced by children who are waiting in some cases up to four years for surgery.  The condition is sometimes by then inoperable because the child's condition has worsened to such an extent.  The parents want this issue tackled.  The view, certainly among the families, is that Cappagh is the place where these surgeries should be performed.  It is the place that needs the funding and attention.  I know there has been talk about money going to CHI.  I am not sure whether that would filter through from CHI to Cappagh or how that would work in practice.<\/p>  <p>  The other point that has been made to me is that there is sometimes competition for places in an operating surgery or theatre.  Children coming in with complex needs, including spina bifida, scoliosis and other conditions, can find, particularly in an elective context, that another child has an accident or something happens in a game of rugby or whatever else and that child is rushed in.  An operation on a child with spina bifida could take six, seven or eight hours while another surgery could be performed in one hour.  Eight children could be seen in the same time it takes to treat one child with spina bifida and the children with spina bifida are knocked out again and again.  They do not necessarily go to the back of the queue but they certainly do not get seen.  The view of the families is that they need a dedicated facility to perform these procedures and operations.  Can that be done in Cappagh?  Does this money allow that?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point for the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500045#UU00300","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1644957300,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The three main hospitals are Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh, which is already doing phenomenal work.  I was out at Cappagh Kids on Friday and saw the facility, which is fantastic.

In one of them, there is a lot of urgent neurosurgery required.  There is a lot of urgent heart surgery required in the other.

That has been a difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  I am trying to understand how the constituent parts of the hospital system, including Cappagh, the CHI, the Beacon, as the Minister mentioned, and other places, can come together to provide that holistic care in a way that tackles the waiting lists and allows children to be seen and accommodated without having to wait four years or until a time their condition is inoperable.  We must also provide the follow-on services that are required post operation so they can be seen in a timely fashion and in a way they are not competing with children with less complex needs, which is the case at times now.<\/p>  <p>  There was talk in the Chamber last week of &euro;5 million funding for Cappagh and money that has gone to CHI.

There is additional funding going to Cappagh to allow it to do work.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked whether the more complex work can be done in Cappagh.  At the moment, the surgical teams have said the most complex work needs to be done in Crumlin and Temple Street.  One of the reasons for that is that high-dependency units are required.  One needs a lot behind that work because the cases are very complex.  However, I spent a lot of time at Cappagh on Friday.  Its staff have big ambitions.  They have submitted a proposal, for example, that I think is really interesting for significantly more high-dependency unit beds, which could help the children but also help with adult orthopaedics as well.  What I would like to see, with additional funding, is complex work also being done at Cappagh.

Last December, I brought a memo to Government and secured agreement on a new national elective ambulatory care strategy that will transform the way in which day cases, scheduled procedures, surgeries, diagnostics and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to tackle waiting lists through the development of dedicated, stand-alone elective hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Initial proposals, as set out in a strategic assessment report, had been to develop elective day-case hospitals only.

An advertisement was put in place almost 12 months ago now looking for sites to be identified and here we are.  Even if we identify a site in the morning, we have to get a design team in to design it, go through a planning process and get contractors in to get the job done.<\/p>  <p>  It is now time to identify the site.  I am not aware of any announcement or promises that a site was identified already, but my understanding is the work has been done.  Why can we not now take the next step of identifying this site and get on with the planning process?<\/p>  <p>  One of the places that is available to the HSE and where it actually owns the land already is Sarsfieldscourt.  It has more than 100 acres where the elective hospital can be built block by block.  I seriously believe we are talking about an elective hospital not only for Cork but also for Munster.  There is a huge undercapacity in the health service, whether it is in Limerick, Kerry, Waterford or Cork.

The first thing to state very clearly is this is being prioritised and moved forward.  I brought a memo to Government recently.  We got agreement on the elective hospitals, including for Cork.  One of the asks, and this is why I said it earlier, was that the proposal that came to me from the group that reviewed this had a very material change to it.  As I said, the proposal I got was for day case only.  Through extensive consultation at a political and clinical level, we changed that.  It is a very material change.  The business case, therefore, had to be updated.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to be able to share with the Deputies that this preliminary business case has come back into the Department.  It came back in on Monday morning and is now being assessed by Department officials.  That will then go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will see what it has to say but it is hoped it will come sign off on it and then we can move very quickly into design and tender.  We have to get going on this.  The State is not good at building hospitals quickly.  In fact, we are very bad at it.  We obviously have to go through all the processes in terms of protecting public money, but we have got to move on this.<\/p>  <p>  Both Deputies asked about the site.  The short answer is I have a recommendation on a site but no site has been agreed.  A Government decision has not been taken on a particular site.  That is what the business case is going to address.  I have discussed the issue at length with many Deputies and colleagues here and with clinicians in Cork.  As the Deputies will know, probably better than I do, there are very strongly held views on multiple different sites.  It would not be appropriate for me just yet to say which site is likely the one on which I want a final recommendation based on inpatients and day cases.  I would then very much like to share with the House the preferred site as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500046#VV00500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1644957900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The Minister said the site has been identified but he is not announcing it at the moment.

We have sites like Sarsfieldscourt in Glanmire, the orthopaedic hospital in Gurranabraher and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Shanakiel.

There are brilliant hospitals there.  However, the health service in Cork is under enormous sustained pressure.  The HSE recently intervened directly, as Deputies will be aware, and that had an impact, but it is not remotely enough.  In parallel with our putting in place a regional elective centre based in Cork, we are also looking, as a matter of urgency, at how we can very quickly add more capacity there, including in diagnostics, beds, operating theatres, community-based care, home care options and so forth.

The HSE confirmed that as of 2 February, the latest available data show there were 23 children on the Longford-north Westmeath CAMHS waiting list and 14 on the south Westmeath list.  The primary care psychology service does not cross-check its waiting lists with CAMHS or other services to see whether children are on more than one list.  It is my understanding, however, that there are children on both waiting lists.  All children are accepted or not accepted to primary care psychology services based on their clinical presentation and the appropriateness of primary care psychology to meet those clinical needs.  Just before Christmas, I allocated &euro;4 million for an initiative to reduce the number of children and young people under 18 years of age who have been waiting more than 12 months for a primary care psychology appointment.  I am delighted that we were able to reduce the list by more than 1,600 young people in that time.  Further investment of approximately &euro;1.4 million for quarter 1 has been secured to support that ongoing initiative.<\/p>  <p>  All 73 CAMHS teams throughout the country will be audited.  There is a three-pronged approach from the HSE, with the first part consisting of a full nationwide audit of compliance with existing CAMHS operational guidelines, structures, processes, teams composition, skills mix and standard operating procedures.  The second component will involve qualitative research to identify the experiences of children, and their families, who use CAMHS.  All three components are important but I consider the third to be particularly so.  It will involve an independently led audit conducted across all CAMHS teams, to include a random selection of files proportionate to the medical caseload from a continuous six-month, predefined time period in 2021.  Coupled with that, the Mental Health Commission, representatives of which I met with yesterday, is conducting its own review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500047#WW01100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1644958500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I am heartened by the Minister of State's response and I pay tribute to her efforts in this area.

At Beaumont Hospital, general surgery, which is probably the most relevant point here, makes up a significant portion of the inpatient and day-case waiting lists.

The average price of fertiliser a year ago was a costly high of &euro;300 per tonne.  Today&rsquo;s prices have skyrocketed, with CAN fertiliser costing Irish farmers more than &euro;600 per tonne and urea costing more than &euro;900 per tonne.  Consequently, for a typical, mid-sized farmer feeding 120 tonnes of ration and using 30 tonnes of fertiliser per year, the rise in input costs will add &euro;23,400 in additional costs.<\/p>  <p>  The main driver for increased fertiliser costs in Europe are the record natural gas prices, due to the Government&rsquo;s agenda to decarbonise electricity generation through over-zealous and half-baked green policies.  The EU's policies to protect the Continent&rsquo;s fertiliser producers by imposing import levies on fertilisers are also having an impact.<\/p> <p>Just a few weeks ago at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I challenged Mr. Fabien Santini from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development on the origins of, and response to, the crisis.  He stated that each member state government has been given the latitude to provide unique farmer support through a relaxation of the state aid framework.  This mechanism is currently only available until 2022.

It is a hugely important issue.  This is going to affect every man, woman and child in the State.  The Minister of State might ask how that is.  Farmers cannot buy fertiliser.  Thankfully, credit unions are stepping in to give loans because the banks are not lending and the Government is standing idly by.  We have been told by the European Commission that member state governments can make decisions to intervene and try to lessen the price.  Sweden has dropped the price of fuel back to 2018 levels but here we are rubbing our hands and talking about packages for the Luas and everything else.  We have to do something about the cost of fertiliser because it is adding pressures across the board, to the food chain, to the housewife and to mum's purse on a Friday evening.  People just cannot afford it.  The farmers cannot afford it.  A Green Party Deputy welcomed the cost of fertiliser because he said it would stop people using nitrogen and everything else.  That is a warped kind of thinking.  Farmers, including mixed farmers, dairy men and everything else practise good animal husbandry.  They want to have good fresh grass and fresh produce and to be able to produce it at a reasonable cost, which they can pass on in the price of milk and everything else.  If this keeps spiralling out of control, the housewife and mum's purse, or the househusband or whoever else, will not be able to afford to live.

At this rate they will not survive.  They will have to pass their costs on to the consumer.  People are wondering about inflation and what is causing it.  This is one of the causes.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to do two things, the first of which is to forego the levy or tariff of &euro;50 a tonne that is being charged on countries outside the EU.

I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.  The very significant rise in fertiliser prices in the last year, and particularly in recent months, is concerning and my Department is closely monitoring the situation.  While there are a number of factors at play in the market, there is no sign of fertiliser prices easing in the short to medium term.  There are no fertilisers manufactured in Ireland.  Rather, fertiliser companies blend a number of imported fertiliser products into different compositions suitable for agricultural use in Ireland.  Indigenous fertiliser companies are dependent on global supply and demand and are subject to euro exchange rates against the US dollar and other currencies on the price they pay for fertiliser.  The well-publicised rise in gas prices, which is a key input in nitrogen fertiliser production, has contributed significantly to the upward trend in fertiliser prices.  Furthermore, an exacerbating factor is the increased demand for fertiliser from large grain-producing countries, which is being fuelled by strong global grain markets.  This increased global demand has impacted on supplies and added to upward pressure on prices.  The imposition of anti-dumping tariffs from certain third countries is, of course, an additional, albeit secondary, factor when fertiliser is imported into the EU from these producing countries.  It is clear that there has been a confluence of issues over the past 12 months or so, all having an upward effect on global fertiliser prices.  Energy prices remain well above January 2021 levels and transport costs have also added to price increases.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2021, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine requested that Teagasc lay out a credible roadmap to assist farmers in the short term, as well as offering a long-term solution in the move to reduce dependence on chemical fertiliser.  The Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign was launched on 26 January.  Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisers through a compendium of 20 fact sheets, to optimise the use of plant nutrients and to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500049#YY00400","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1644959700,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Ah, Minister-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500049#YY00500","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1644959700,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Deputy, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500049#YY00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644959700,"counter":506,"content":"<p>-----their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  Teagasc is working with farmers through the Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser campaign to help them adapt to the current fertiliser market and support them to make informed decisions on what is best for their farms.  This is a strategy that can ease the price pressure on farmers.  It is a strategy that will be good for the environment and good for farmers' pockets.<\/p>  <p>  At the November meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the Minister raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs.  The EU Commission was called upon to consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate and for this matter to be examined as a priority.  Following the November meeting, the Minister wrote to the EU Commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, requesting that the Commission's assessment of the ongoing appropriateness of anti-dumping duties on fertilisers be completed as a matter of priority.  The EU Commission responded on 26 January to say that it is still collecting information to establish the relevant facts.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new &euro;1 million initiative by my Department will support the planting of multi-species swards in order to reduce dependence on fertilisers.  This scheme will support farmers to use multi-species grass when reseeding.  It will mean a mixture of complementary species will be sown, including clover, which will enable farmers to significantly reduce their use of nitrogen.  A pilot soil sampling programme has also been introduced by my Department, which will provide farmers with comprehensive details of the soil health and soil condition of their farm.  This will provide them with critical information to make farm management decisions on nutrient inputs to the most efficient levels.<\/p>  <p>  With fertiliser prices constituting such a high portion of a farmer's expenditure, we are aware that the impact of continued high fertiliser prices will have a negative effect on farmers' businesses.  Ireland, unfortunately, will remain a fertiliser price-taker in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500049#YY00700","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1644959700,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Losses are escalating by the day.  There are a number of circumstances.  There is a perfect storm there at present for pig farmers.  Whether it is Covid disruption, Brexit or the Ukraine dispute, it is all having a severe impact on pig farms.<\/p><p>The first impact of Covid was to reduce the number of staff in processing facilities.  In particular, where pig farmers are sending their pigs north of the Border, given a substantial number of our pigs were going north of the Border, they are finding it hard to get these pigs killed.  That has had a twin impact in that the pigs are being kept long on the farm and costing more money to feed them, and the carcase weight is increasing as well and the pig makes less money at the end of the day when it is slaughtered.  There is also the threat of African swine fever, which now has advanced as far as Germany as it crosses Europe.  This is a serious threat to the pig industry as well and is having a negative impact on pricing throughout Europe.  The impact of Brexit has been sorely felt by the pig industry.  Prior to Brexit, 50% of all our pig produce was going to the UK.  It was a lucrative market and those exports have dropped 50% since the Brexit agreement.  Our bacon has had to go to less attractive markets, obviously making a poorer price.<\/p><p>Price inflation has impacted significantly on farmers.  Grain prices and feed prices have risen dramatically in the past couple of months.  Feed has gone up by 24%, energy has risen by 100% and transport costs have risen by 43%.<\/p><p>I was talking to a normal-size pig farmer - a man with 1,000 sows, in the modern concept in this country, is an average-size farmer.  Feed per month is costing &euro;32,300 extra; energy, &euro;5,298 extra; and transport, &euro;862 extra.<\/p><p>The price has collapsed.  The price, in early 2021, was at &euro;1.90 per kg.  Today, that has gone under &euro;1.40, at &euro;1.38 per kg.<\/p><p>Unless this industry gets support, we will have serious losses.  We have only 300 pig farmers left in the country.  It is a specialised industry, but it is our third most important sector.  It is worth &euro;1 billion to the economy.<\/p><p>These farmers are now under considerable financial pressure and a package has to be put in place.  Other countries in the EU have stepped in to help their pig farmers and we cannot quote EU state aid rules as being a barrier to this.  Poland, France and the Netherlands have stepped in with a temporary state aid framework that allows farmers in these countries to access funding of up to &euro;290,000 per farmer, which is far in excess of the current <i>de minimis<\/i>state aid ceiling of &euro;25,000.  There is a mechanism within EU regulations to help this sector.<\/p><p>At present, it is estimated that pigs are losing on average &euro;35 a head leaving the farm.  That farmer I talking about lately said he is losing &euro;8,000 a week.  That is an unsustainable situation.  Many of these farmers have invested heavily in their infrastructure in recent years to ensure they have a sustainable method of production and that any risk of pollution is removed.  This sector, if it does not get help immediately, will not survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500050#ZZ04800","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1644960300,"counter":558,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am certainly happy to bring the following to the attention of the House: the continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for my Department, given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context.  It is a large agrifood sector and has shown remarkable growth in recent years.  The sector supports approximately 8,000 jobs spanning production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services.<\/p>  <p>  Our pig farmers have always been remarkably resilient but my Department is acutely aware of the challenges they are facing.  The pigmeat sector across the EU has faced significant challenges in 2021, including the impact of African swine fever in a number of member states and consequential loss of third-country markets.  This has had a knock-on effect on supply and price within the Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  The average price paid for pigs in Ireland has fallen in recent months, in line with trends across the EU.  The 2021 average price was more than 8% lower than that of 2020.  As of 6 February, the average grade E pig price came in at &euro;141 per 100 kg, that is, just over 7% lower than the same week last year.  This is still well above the EU average price, but in the current circumstances is creating a significant price-cost squeeze.<\/p>  <p>  At the recent European Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, clearly expressed his concerns regarding the difficulties facing the Irish pigmeat sector, both in respect of the ongoing impact of increases in fuel, fertiliser, feed and energy prices over recent times that are putting farmer margins under significant pressure, and the sustained nature of the difficulties being experienced on the pigmeat market.  The Minister sought the rapid deployment of appropriate solutions on both issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, met with the main banks to discuss the current challenges in the pigmeat sector and the importance of their ongoing support.  At this meeting it was emphasised the importance of the pig sector, its overall resilience and the importance of their support to their customers through the current downturn in the business cycle.  The key message was that farmers experiencing cash flow difficulties should engage with the banks as soon as possible to discuss options and that the banks remain committed to supporting their customers in the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, they met with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to discuss the Brexit impact loan scheme and the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, both of which are financed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These finance schemes can be used for working capital finance and include features that address the current financial needs of pig farmers.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the cyclical nature of the commodity markets, which for the pig sector at this time is compounded by rising input costs.<\/p> <p>During this period, maximum flexibility of financial matters is needed to ensure the ongoing viability of those in the pig sector.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, chaired the recent pig round table and had a further detailed discussion on the current difficulties with all stakeholders, including farm representatives, the banks, the processing industry and the feed industry.  The increase in input costs is likely to continue for at least the first half of this year.<\/p> <p> In terms of State supports, Bord Bia outlined the significant efforts being made to promote quality-assured Irish pigmeat on the domestic and export markets and Teagasc outlined the dedicated advisory supports being provided to pig farmers.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, also attended a meeting with the IFA president and IFA pig committee members to discuss concerns.  At this meeting, the Minister reiterated the Government's commitment to supporting the sector, including through the previously mentioned advisory supports provided by Teagasc and Bord Bia.  Deputy Cahill can rest assured that the Department will continue to monitor the market situation closely.  We are examining all possible measures to assist in supporting farmers through this significant market disturbance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500050#ZZ04900","speaker":"1661","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644960900,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I am fascinated by the idea of a pig round table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500051#AAA00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644960900,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I accept that the Minister met the stakeholders in the past week and promised to reply to them next week on what he can do for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  Maximum pressure must be put on the financial institutions to give extra overdraft facilities to help pig farmers with their cash flow.  That will not be enough, however.  A package must be provided for the sector.  Feed costs are expected to rise by another &euro;30 a tonne in the next month to six weeks.  Unfortunately, energy costs still look to be moving in one direction only and labour costs are rising significantly as well.  I hope pig markets will start to recover but it is going to be a very long haul to get back to a break-even situation.  We must do what other EU countries are doing.  A package must be put in place.  I urge the Minister of State to provide for a certain period a direct subsidy for each pig slaughtered to try to reduce losses, help cash flow on farms and allow this vital industry to survive.<\/p>  <p>  Swine flu must be monitored.  We must increase security to ensure it does not enter the country.  It has damaged export markets across Europe and there is no doubt it has exacerbated the problem.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure resources are put in place to keep swine flu out of this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said the pig sector is resilient.  I fully accept that, but any sector can only take so many sucker punches.  I do not think the pig sector has ever been in the loss-making situation it is in currently.  Small, medium and big pig producers are under significant pressure.  There are only 300 pig farmers left, yet it is the third largest sector in the agrifood industry and is worth &euro;1 billion to this country.  It would be a disaster if, for want of short-term aid, we did not help the sector to survive this crisis, which is outside its control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500051#AAA00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644960900,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I accept the points made by Deputy Cahill.

It is important to get on top of African swine flu, which is affecting markets across Europe and also export markets out of Europe.  That is having a major additional impact on Irish pork and pigmeat products.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is examining all possible avenues to assist pig farmers during this time of market disturbance.  As I outlined, it will continue the significant engagement to date.  The Department encourages farmers to engage with Teagasc advisers and bank representatives to explore the options available to them.  Whether it is financial assistance or cost-reduction measures they can implement on their farms, they must take the advice that is available.  Pig farmers can rest assured that officials in the Department are examining all possible measures to assist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500051#AAA00400","nonspeaker":"Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","time":1644960900,"counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500051#AAA00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644960900,"counter":564,"content":"<p>We move to the third important issue raised by Deputies Daly, O'Rourke and Martin Kenny.

Its conclusions were sometimes outrageous, sometimes malicious and would sometimes have been laughable if the consequences had not been so tragic for the families and individuals arrested.  Lives were left ruined and people were tortured.

It must be very clear not only that we will ensure this does not happen again but also that we will look back in a very forensic way at how this situation occurred in all of these cases.

I watched the programme as well.<\/p> <p>I am acutely conscious that all of the families and individuals impacted by the incidents which the recent RT&Eacute; series has revisited have suffered significantly over the years as a result of the way in which those investigations were conducted.  There is no doubt that the alleged practices detailed were unacceptable at the time and would not be tolerated today.  Such incidents cast a shadow over the trust we place in our criminal justice and policing systems to ensure justice is done.<\/p> <p> It is important to emphasise, however, that these investigations happened several decades ago and the safeguards which were available at that time to those who were the subject of investigation were very different from those in place today.  It was following on from the work of the &Oacute; Briain and Martin committees that the Criminal Justice Act 1984, regulating the treatment of persons in custody, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 and the Criminal Procedure Act 1993, providing a new system of appeal based on miscarriage of justice, were introduced.  The available safeguards were further strengthened in the years that followed.  Since 2015, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a code of conduct which is signed by all members and forms the core of their commitments in relation to behaviour and standards, and I know the Garda Commissioner is committed to upholding the highest standards within our policing service.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 provides legal protections for anyone who speaks up if they are aware of wrongdoing.  There is a protected disclosure policy in place in the Garda which is designed to ensure that any member who raises issues will be fully supported and that each and every Garda member knows they have the right and responsibility to raise their concerns and be confident they will be listened to and addressed.<\/p> <p> We have a robust system of Garda oversight in place, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, established in 2005.  Oversight structures are currently being further strengthened through the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2021, which is implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, the first principle of which is that human rights are the foundation and the purpose of policing.  The Bill will include an expanded remit for the ombudsman and the establishment of a new policing and community safety authority, which will be provided with extra inspection powers and greater independence.  Governance within the Garda will be enhanced by the Bill.  These provisions, as well as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill, will ensure that garda&iacute; adhere to the best international practice in the conduct of all investigations.<\/p> <p> Miscarriages of justice serve no one.  Those wrongly accused suffer greatly and, equally, the victims and affected families who feel they did not get justice also continue to suffer.  As the Deputies will be aware, several of these investigations have previously been the subject of court proceedings, pardons, State apologies and associated compensation settlements.  The Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act makes clear that such inquiries should be established with regard to definite matters of urgent public importance.  As the Deputies will appreciate, the Act should be used judiciously and many of the tribunals which have been established to date have proven to be very costly.  It is important to listen carefully to the observations made by the judges who have led some of Ireland's recent inquiries, and they have made very clear that public inquiries should serve a clear purpose.  It is important also that we remember there are ongoing Garda actions taking place with regard to some of these cases we are talking about.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for any actions to be taken that might impact on those actions.  While acknowledging that the details of the methods used in the cases in question remain disturbing, taking all of the current circumstances into account, I do not believe the establishment of a public inquiry into these matters, or something similar, would serve any useful purpose.  I will address the Una Lynskey situation in the closing remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500051#AAA00900","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644961500,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.

I want to begin with the Housing for All document.  The review of the income eligibility for social housing is pending.  It is something I feel strongly about.  As a Deputy in Limerick city and north Tipperary, the whole issue of social housing is something I deal with every day of the week with constituents.  When we look at the income limits for social housing, we find that the last substantial change to those limits was in April 2011, approximately 11 years ago.  There were also some changes whereby the cap for the child allowance was removed last year, which was welcome.<\/p> <p>Back in April 2011, the bands for a single person equated approximately to the average industrial wage.  That average industrial wage is now up to about &euro;43,000, which is a 20% increase.  Furthermore, in that period we have seen an increase of nearly 100% in rents and we have seen an increase of 45% in the average cost of a house, from about &euro;200,000 to &euro;290,000.  In April 2011, there was a &euro;5,000 increase in all bands.  I am proposing that this time there should be a minimum &euro;5,000 increase across all bands.  Second, the &euro;5,000 is a 20% increase for band 3, which is a single person on &euro;25,000.  I would like to see a 20% increase in the allowance for an adult, which would go from 5% to 6% with the cap going from 10% to 12%.  For a child it would go from 2.5% to 3%.<\/p> <p> I do not want something to be done that would have the unintended consequence of being hugely inflationary.  With the limits I have proposed, people would still qualify for the housing assistance payment, HAP, and social housing.  The follow-on from that is that anyone who is involved in social housing should also aspire to be able to purchase his or her own home.  The incremental purchase scheme is in place and I would advance it.  However, at the moment many people might not be able to qualify for it with the current income limits for social housing.  What I am proposing would increase the amount of a mortgage for someone who is applying for the incremental purchase scheme.  This would be of the order of &euro;20,000 because you would have people on &euro;5,000 plus higher income limits within social housing.<\/p> <p> Where is the review?  When will it be published?  I am talking about a &euro;5,000 increase across the board on all bands plus an increase from 5% to 6% for the adult dependent, increasing the cap from 10% to 12%, which is two adults, to keep pace and then an increase in the child allowance from 2.5% to 3%.  That is a 20% increase across the board and it somewhat keeps pace with the increase in the average industrial wage.  Thus, the same basis that was there in 2011 would apply today.  It will also feed into the incremental purchase scheme.  Regardless of who one is, one should be able to aspire to own one&rsquo;s home.  The current income limits for social housing make that difficult under the incremental purchase scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500052#BBB00600","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644962100,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for the consistent work he has done on this, specifically on the income eligibility criteria and the workings he has articulated in his argument.  The overarching principle of social housing support is to provide adequate housing support to those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  Applications for such supports are assessed by local authorities in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated social housing assessment regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The regulations introduced a standard system for assessing applicants for social housing in 2011, as the Deputy referred to, establishing a fair and more consistent and transparent approach to determine eligibility for support.  To this end, they prescribed maximum net income limits for each local authority in three different bands according to the area concerned.  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with a 5% allowance for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and, separately, an additional allowance of 2.5% for each child.  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, was published in September 2021 and committed to reviewing income eligibility criteria for social housing.  The review was considered necessary because, as the Deputy mentioned, the cut-off points for each income eligibility threshold band were determined when average rent prices across the country were decreasing.  The continuing suitability of the banding structure was questionable given the significant rental price growth throughout the country since and given that private rents in all local authority areas had risen considerably since thresholds were originally set in 2011.  The review was undertaken in 2021 and examined, among other things, the efficiency of the current banding model; the income limits applicable to local authorities; and the new initiatives being brought forward in affordability and cost rental housing.  It was completed towards the end of last year, and included recommendations for short and longer term reform of the income eligibility arrangements.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, is considering the review&rsquo;s findings and recommendations and he expects to decide on the proposed changes to the recommendations shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The review of income eligibility is part of a broad suite of social housing reforms and complements measures being delivered through the Affordable Housing Act 2021 to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of homes.  The Act was commenced in August 2021 and established a fair basis for four new affordable housing measures, including delivering affordable homes on local authority lands; introducing cost rental, a new form of tenure; introducing first homes shared equity scheme; and expanding the Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and applying it to cost rental as well as to social and affordable housing.  The Act was supported through unprecedented funding, committed through Housing for All, of &euro;4 billion annually.  Specifically, 54,000 affordable housing homes, comprising 18,000 cost rental homes and 36,000 affordable homes, will be delivered between now and 2030.  Targeted delivery for 2022 is 1,550 new cost rental homes and 2,000 affordable purchase homes.<\/p>  <p>  I hear Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s proposal clearly.  I know the review is complete and I expect that the Minister will act on it shortly.  I thank the Deputy for the substantial amount of work he has brought forward on this pressing issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500053#CCC00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1644962100,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Over the past 11 years, rents have gone up by 100% in the private sector, the price of houses has gone up by 45%, and the price of the average home has gone from &euro;212,000 to &euro;295,000.  The income limits were set based on the average industrial wage, so these limits must go up to keep pace with that.  My proposal is a straightforward one.  I ask that we make a &euro;5,000 increase on all bands, an increase for the adult dependant by the same 20% from 5% to 6% with a cap of 12%, and an increase for the child from 2.5% to 3%, which is the same increase.  That is a relatively modest proposal.  However, it ensures it should not be inflationary for rents.  Furthermore, it ensures more people qualify for HAP.<\/p>  <p>  The incremental purchase scheme requires people to be on a social housing payment for a period of ten years.  That is either a council tenant or someone on the rental assistance scheme, RAS, or HAP.  We have to have this integrated model such that people can go from being in rented accommodation to being able to purchase.  However, they must get supports.  For anyone on more than &euro;30,000, the incremental purchase scheme is a 40% discount and I know that is changing, but that makes a huge difference.  There is social housing and the incremental purchase scheme.  The layer above that would be affordable housing and then there are people buying privately.  One of the starting bases is that we get the social housing income limits correct, fair and in keeping with what has happened over the last 11 years.<\/p>  <p>  When does the Minister of State expect the review will be published?

Both should go hand in hand in terms of assessing where the results should land.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Donnell's proposal is very sensible.  Since 2011 our society and our economy have changed so much in terms of the journey we have travelled.
