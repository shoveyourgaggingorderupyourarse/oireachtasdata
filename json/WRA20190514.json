The IDA has a significant role to play in helping us achieve that objective. It has been working hard, through its staff both here and abroad, to encourage overseas investors to locate or expand in Ireland&rsquo;s regions. The Agency&rsquo;s performance demonstrates that these efforts are producing results. There are now, for example, over 132,000 people employed across more than 680 IDA client firms outside of Dublin. 2018 also saw foreign direct investment (FDI) increase in every region of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Donegal, along with many other parts of the country, has benefitted from this strong regional focus. The County has experienced a 60% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2012, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 2,223 in 2012 to 3,564 at the end of last year. In 2018 alone, the total of IDA supported jobs in Donegal increased by 5%, with the County now home to 12 IDA companies including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica. <\/p>  <p>  There was one new name investment in 2009 in Donegal representing 2.5% of the national total in that year.  In 2010 there were no new name investments in the County.  In 2011 and 2012 there was one such investment in each year, representing 1.6% and 1.5% of the national totals respectively for those years. Between 2013 and 2018 there were no new name investments in Donegal.  <\/p>  <p>  Those statistics, however, only serve to emphasise that FDI performance is not accurately measured by the number of new-name investors, given Donegal&rsquo;s strong performance &ndash; as outlined above &ndash; over the last decade. Indeed, the IDA&rsquo;s experience, over many decades, has shown that the growth of existing overseas firms here can produce as many jobs &ndash; if not more &ndash; than new name investors. That is why the IDA focuses on both supporting the growth and expansion of its current clients here as well as securing new investors to locate for the first time in locations like Donegal. Pursuing that twin-track strategy has helped produce record FDI results in recent years and should lead to further investment and job creation in the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  With respect to 2019, the indications are that FDI in Donegal will continue to increase. For example, Abbott Laboratories announced plans last July to expand its workforce in the County with the creation of 500 new jobs. The IDA is already working hard to attract further such high-quality investment to Donegal and continues to promote the County to investors considering investing in Ireland for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  While clear progress has been made in creating new jobs and economic opportunity in Donegal, the Government is determined to achieve more. Efforts will continue in 2019 and beyond, whether in support of indigenous or overseas enterprise, to help create more employment and economic opportunities in the County. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400054#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 48 to 53, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement Legal Cases","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400054#WRB00700"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[20589\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400054#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on whether the full report of the trial of a person (details supplied) should be made available to Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in order to identify potential legal lacunas and weaknesses from existing company law that emerged in the case with a view to strengthening the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill 2018.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>There has been extensive engagement with the Office of the Attorney General on the publication of the Report of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) prepared under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014.

This is because there is a public interest in ensuring that ongoing and future investigations are not compromised by the disclosure of details of an individual investigation and the investigative process itself. However, while it is not possible to publish the report itself, an account of the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer, in so far as they relate directly to the role of the ODCE, was published on 4 December 2018 by my Department.  The account sets out the factors which led to the investigative shortcomings identified by the Judge, including the need for a broader skills base, a greater range and depth of knowledge and experience of criminal prosecutions within the Office and a greater appreciation of the necessity to employ appropriate procedures and manage risk.<\/p>  <p>  Since the time of the investigation, the Director has implemented multiple reforms within the ODCE, including staffing and procedural reforms that address many of the issues that led to the investigative shortcomings outlined by Judge Aylmer.  Further measures to be taken include the establishment, as announced by Government in November 2017, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as a stand-alone agency, to provide it with greater autonomy in relation to staffing resources and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. <\/p>  <p>  In his judgment, Judge Aylmer did not point to any deficiencies in the company law framework.

The Court decision held that the dispute settlement mechanism in CETA is compatible with EU law and complies with (i) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, (ii) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, and (iii) the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular of the right of access to a court and right to an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter.  <\/p>  <p>  This very recent decision of the Court means that no changes are required to be made to the text of the CETA, and EU Member States can proceed with ratification of CETA, according to the requirements of their national law.<\/p>  <p>  While CETA has provisionally been applied since 21st September 2017 in respect of the trade elements, however, in order for all aspects of CETA to come into force, including the Investment Court System, the agreement must be ratified by all EU Member States.  To date, 12 Member States have ratified CETA, while Ireland, along with several other Member States, chose to await the outcome of the CJEU opinion prior to considering the commencement of the ratification process at national level.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the very recent opinion of the CJEU, my Department will be seeking to progress the necessary steps for Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of CETA, including consultation with the Office of the Attorney General as well as submitting a Memorandum to Government requesting the Government to authorise the moving of a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution), seeking approval on the terms of the Agreement.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann votes in favour of the Agreement Ireland will notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union that we have completed our respective internal requirements and procedures concerning the ratification of CETA.  While I cannot provide a precise timeframe for this ratification process, my Department is prioritising the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[18018\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of negotiations with the European Commission or other European Union bodies in respect of the relaxation of state aid rules in which it is appropriate for particular sectors that may require additional funding in the context of Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>My Department and I are engaged in ongoing dialogue with colleagues in the European Commission DG Competition in relation to the issues arising for Ireland in the context of various Brexit scenarios and the potential severe impacts on the Irish enterprise base, jobs and regional economies.<\/p><p>Specifically, on 24<sup>th<\/sup>January 2019 I met with Commissioner Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition who has responsibility for EU State aid policy, at my Department.

Steps taken in that regard over recent years have included the recruitment of a number of specialist staff to enhance key skills and organisational capability.  Such recruitment has included Forensic Accountants; a Digital Forensic Specialist; 2 Enforcement Lawyers and 2 Enforcement Portfolio Managers.  The provision of additional resources has included the establishment of an in-house digital forensics laboratory, including an on-site digital forensics capability whereby data retrieved from digital devices can be relayed to investigators in real time. <\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1m was provided for the ODCE in 2019 to reflect the likely costs associated with the transition of the ODCE into a stand-alone Agency and to meet the costs of the INM investigation.  A funding allocation of &euro;6.057m has been provided for the ODCE for 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of resourcing of the ODCE is kept under review on a regular basis between my officials and the ODCE as part of the ongoing work in operationalising the transition of the ODCE to a stand-alone agency and also as part of the normal day-to-day interaction to discuss operational matters relating to the Office.  <\/p>  <p>  On the question of the publication of the report, the advice of the Attorney General was sought on the publication of the Report of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) prepared under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Because of section 956 of the Companies Act 2014 the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation is prohibited from publishing reports prepared pursuant to Section 955 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 contains strict confidentiality obligations on information in the possession of the Director.

The National Broadband Plan will be vital for the delivery of strategies such as Future Jobs Ireland as we prepare for the next stage of our economic development.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland is a new medium-term economic pathway that will build and improve upon our already globally connected economy to make it more resilient, innovative and adaptable to future challenges. The National Broadband Plan will support the ambitions in Future Jobs Ireland that aim to enable people and businesses throughout Ireland to seize the opportunities arising from technological advances and the transition to a digital economy. These opportunities will arise across multiple sectors including Education, Health, Enterprise, Environment, Smart Farming, Social Inclusion &amp;amp; Rural\/Regional Development, Tourism and Transportation. The National Broadband Plan will support Future Jobs Ireland in helping our workers and businesses succeed in the digital, low carbon economy of the future, ensuring a country in which every citizen and business, no matter where they are based, can progress together. <\/p>  <p>  Access to world-class, high-speed connectivity is core to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and key to establishing Ireland as a world leader in this transformational digital age &ndash; one of the ambitions in Future Jobs Ireland 2019. The National Broadband Plan will foster innovation and employment growth by ensuring that our workforce is connected through world class broadband. <\/p>  <p>  Digitalisation can drive substantial increases in productivity, innovation, social improvements and connections, and economic growth and jobs. To maximise the benefits from digitalisation we will need a strategic approach. Future Jobs Ireland 2019 sets out how we will begin to implement this strategic approach through the development of a National Digital Strategy, an Industry 4.0 Strategy and a National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy. The roll out of the National Broadband Plan is critical for the use of advanced digital technologies, core to these strategies, such as the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, and cloud and cognitive computing.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, a driving goal of Government policy is to increase the living standards of our people. Increasing productivity levels is a key enabler of achieving this goal. Through Future Jobs we hope to adopt measures to increase the productivity of indigenous SMEs over time. Therefore, I welcome the potential for significant productivity benefits for the almost 44,000 small and micro businesses in the areas where high speed broadband will operate and the potential for them to link to new markets and develop a global footprint. Future Jobs Ireland 2019 includes the ambition of encouraging enterprises to exploit technology and business process improvements to increase productivity. High-quality broadband provision will be vital in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Investment now in a future-proofed network will also allow for much wider activities in the future &ndash; for homes, schools, farms and businesses. Technology is completely transforming our lives and will continue to do so. Future Jobs Ireland recognises that automation, AI and other forms of technology are expected to radically change many jobs, many businesses, and entire industries. A future-proofed network will enable advances in virtual reality, cloud computing, distance learning, precision farming, artificial intelligence, connected devices and the Internet of Things. The National Broadband Plan will allow Ireland to take full advantage of the opportunities in this digital economy which is conservatively expected to expand to more than &euro;21 billion or 6% of GDP, by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  High speed broadband will help diversify the rural economy and will offer further options for intelligent working arrangements, particularly remote working. Future Jobs Ireland 2019 aims to foster participation in the labour market through flexible working solutions. In a tightening labour market such as that in Ireland, offering flexible working options can benefit employers, workers and wider society. We already have a number of companies in Ireland who offer remote working to their employees and this trend is only going to increase in the future. The ability to work in regional locations can help to take the pressure off our cities. It can mean substantial savings for employees in terms of rents and property costs while also reducing the need to commute leading to a better work-life balance, not to mention a more motivated workforce, fewer sick days and greater productivity. <\/p>  <p>  The roll out of the National Broadband Plan will also have a critical role in driving our research and innovation agenda &ndash; a key component of Future Jobs Ireland. In this regard the important research work that Science Foundation Ireland funds in terms of developing innovative new technologies in areas such as eHealth, Smart Farming and Drone Technology, all of which will benefit strongly from the implementation of the plan.<\/p>  <p>  The pace of technological change means that workers across skill levels must be prepared to reskill and upskill throughout their working careers, or they face the possibility of being left behind. With this in mind, Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent is one of the five Pillars in Future Jobs Ireland. We need to enable enterprises, and SMEs in particular, to invest in upskilling their workforce, including their managerial capacity, to enhance and maintain productivity; to adapt to technological disruption; and to identify and exploit opportunities from the digital and green economies as they emerge. High-speed, high-quality broadband provision across the country will allow more workers to engage in lifelong learning through accessible and flexible training solutions including online courses, webinars etc. Through commitments in Future Jobs Ireland 2019, training providers will be encouraged to increase the provision of flexible training options to ensure that the courses suit the needs of those in employment. <\/p>  <p>  In line with Future Jobs Ireland aspirations, and complementing several Government strategies, delivery of the National Broadband Plan will help enhance the potential of the regions in terms of economic development by progressing the building of regional economic drivers and reinforcing opportunities to diversify and strengthen the rural economy, to leverage the potential of regional locations and communities. The National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler as officials in my Department work with colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, on the development of new and additional ambitions and deliverables for inclusion in Future Jobs Ireland 2020 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[20592\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has formally submitted a request or is preparing to submit a request at EU level to revise state aid rules as set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1407\/2013 to protect exposed Irish enterprises and exporters from Brexit.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>My Department has been working closely with the EU Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish\/EU Technical Working Group on State Aid.

Total employment in the Agency's client companies now stands at over 230,000 with 2018 representing a record year in terms of employment growth and new investment projects. Moreover, real progress is being made in deepening and growing regional investment. For example, 58% of all IDA-supported jobs are outside of Dublin.

The IDA is focused on building on progress made in recent years and continuing to attract jobs and create economic opportunities all over Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to Louth in particular, foreign direct investment (FDI) levels in the County are trending in the right direction.

The new Plans are complementary to the Action Plan for Rural Development and I am pleased to say that implementation has commenced in all regions. <\/p>  <p>  Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and, there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the Future Jobs Ireland initiative. <\/p>  <p>  The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise each region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. These stakeholders include: the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, higher and further education institutes, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 and the Action Plan for Rural Development are central pillars of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, of which 135,000 are outside the Dublin region by 2020 and the Government's commitment to prioritise balanced regional development.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been strong progress to date in delivering to these targets. According to the most recent CSO quarterly Labour Force Survey (seasonally unadjusted at regional level), the national employment target for 2020 has already been exceeded, with 2,281,300 in employment as of Q4 2018, which is the highest number at work ever recorded. With nearly 133,000 jobs created outside of Co. Dublin since Q1 2016, the Government is well positioned to meet the regional employment growth target by the end of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Through the new Regional Enterprise Plans and the ongoing work of the enterprise agencies and the LEOs, the Government remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 per cent in each region by 2020 and to bring and\/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.<\/p>  <p>  Unemployment has fallen in every region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative in 2015. Only two regions, the Midlands and South-East, are currently outside the unemployment target set for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In February I announced very good results from the Local Enterprise Offices around the country. Overall, they supported the creation of 3,656 new jobs (net) in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  All regions saw increases in IDA employment over 2018, with the Midlands region experiencing the highest growth at 14 percent. <\/p>  <p>  Also, two-thirds (64 percent) of new Enterprise Ireland jobs created in 2018 were outside of Dublin. The North West saw the largest level of increases at 9 percent.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as well as meeting the numerical targets, it is also about creating jobs that are of good quality and sustainable over the longer term.

Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises as they adjust to the new relationship with the UK and pursue new opportunities.   <\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland [ITI] works with SMEs on an all-island basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit.  As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness-raising events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.  To date, more than 7,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.    <\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Planning Voucher scheme, which enables businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each.  Businesses are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report, 1,476 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,310 have been approved.    <\/p>  <p>  In March, ITI launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit: Implementation voucher, which offers 50% financial support up to &pound;5,000 towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters.   <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business.  The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 593 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.  As of February 2019, the LEOs are also offering customs training workshops to support in businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.   <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help businesses prepare for Brexit.  Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as of April 2019, 651 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradeable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Dublin aside, the most recent quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme.    <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 3rd May, there have been 608 eligibility applications received, of which 550 have been approved and 124 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;27.76m.    <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was launched in April 2019.  The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.     <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.   <\/p>  <p>  Over 5,000 businesses have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 194 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved.  233 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience.     <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Customs Insights course helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes. The course advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available.  This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not.    <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). <\/p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.  This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit.    <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have participated in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign.  This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit and have included events in Monaghan and Donegal. In addition to these events, Enterprise Ireland has rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country, including events in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Cootehill.     <\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the continuing uncertainty around the withdrawal process may have led businesses to defer their Brexit preparations.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will bring change for Irish businesses. I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[20508\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if further supports are available to businesses that are affected by the uncertainty surrounding the decision of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union; if and when this will take place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies have put in place a full range of supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses across the country are prepared for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.

The Group comprises representatives from DG Comp, my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland.  Its objective has been to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  Much has been achieved by this Working Group.  It has examined and explored a range of opportunities within State Aid rules including the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme under GBER rules, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Rescue and Restructuring Scheme to include Temporary liquidity aid and the Group is currently working closely with DG Agri to explore the range of opportunities under the Agriculture and Forestry State aid guidelines.  It has looked at regionally important, exposed clients and their building resilience in their response to Brexit by using environmental and innovation aid.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I met with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centred around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implication become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Site Visits","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC04800"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[20588\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC04900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of regional IDA site visits by county; the number and status of vacant IDA properties nationwide; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>Regional development remains a key priority for myself and my Department. We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and my Department and its Agencies have been working hard towards that goal. Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment, for example, now located outside Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency. Last year the Agency also delivered 113 regional investments. Our aim is to increase these numbers further in 2019 and create more jobs and economic opportunities across regional Ireland. <\/p><p>As I have previously made clear, the availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment. Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure high quality jobs but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It therefore remains an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland. The IDA currently owns 29 properties across Ireland. Of these, 14 are occupied by IDA clients with the remainder available for prospective or existing investors. <\/p><p>As regards site visits, they are important in helping the IDA showcase regional locations to prospective investors. The Agency and its staff continue to do their utmost, including through site visits, to encourage overseas companies to locate in regional areas. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned. It is also the case, no matter what efforts we make to underline the undoubted benefits of regional locations, that certain overseas companies will only consider investing in large urban areas for various commercial or operational reasons. <\/p><p>Table A below outlines the number and status of IDA owned properties by County.

The principal EU legal instrument underpinning these controls is Council Regulation 4028\/2009 setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of Dual-use items. My Department is the national competent authority with responsibility for implementing this Regulation. Dual-use items are goods and technology that have both civil and military applications.<\/p><p>In September 2016 the European Commission published its proposal to <i>recast<\/i>(i.e. update and modernise) the Dual-Use Regulation of 2009.  The Commission proposed extensive changes to the Dual-use Regulation in order to enhance EU controls in support of global non-proliferation efforts. These changes reflect advances in technology, new business practices and operational experience over the past decade.<\/p><p>The complexity of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal is illustrated by the 98 amendments put forward by the European Parliament in January 2018.<\/p><p>The Commission's proposal is currently the subject of a detailed, line-by-line examination by Member States&rsquo; technical experts in the Council's Working Party on Dual-use Goods. The experts are working to enhance the Commission&rsquo;s proposal and to address the issues raised by the European Parliament in its 98 amendments. This close scrutiny by the Working Party experts is a key step in the EU&rsquo;s legislative process to ensure that new legislation is robust, proportionate and workable. My officials are contributing actively and constructively to this process.<\/p><p>My officials are strongly supportive of the recast of the Regulation and welcome many elements of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal. <\/p><p>My officials, and those from several other Member States, have concerns about certain provisions in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal related to cybersurveillance technologies. While they fully support efforts to ensure that cybersurveillance technologies are not used to commit human rights violations, they have serious concerns about the effectiveness, proportionality, and unintended consequences of these provisions.<\/p><p>My officials, in conjunction with their colleagues from a number of Member States, have put forward concrete alternative ideas for strengthening EU controls in this area. Principal among them is the suggestion that the EU should develop smarter and more effective sanctions specifically for countering violations of human rights around the world. <\/p><p>Accordingly, Ireland is not opposed to strengthening EU export controls on cybersurveillance software. Ireland is strongly committed to the protection of human rights; it is a cornerstone of our Foreign Policy. Ireland has long been at the forefront of global efforts to promote Human Rights. Ireland is strongly committed to the universality, indivisibility and inter-relatedness of all Human Rights, as set out in the corpus of UN and EU treaties, covenants and protocols. Ireland is actively working with the UN, NGOs and through its overseas development programme, Irish Aid, to promote and protect human rights.<\/p><p>The EU currently has significant controls in place in respect of cybersurveillance technologies and human rights. A broad range of cybersurveillance technologies fall within the scope of the current Dual-use Regulation, including Internet Protocol (IP) network communications surveillance systems or equipment; Telecommunications interception and monitoring equipment; and Intrusion Software. Consequently, a licence is required to export these items outside of the EU.<\/p><p>All applications for export licences are subject to rigorous scrutiny by my officials on a case-by-case basis. Each application is reviewed against the eight risk assessment criteria set out in Article 2 of the European Council Common Position 2008\/944\/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment. Criterion 2 specially addresses respect for human rights in the country of final destination.<\/p><p>My officials also seek observations from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on any foreign policy concerns, including human rights considerations.<\/p><p>Applications are also reviewed against any EU sanctions that may be in place in respect of the destination country.

Embracing Innovation and Technological Change; <\/p><p>2.  Improving SME Productivity;<\/p><p>3.  Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent; <\/p><p>4.  Increasing Participation in the Labour Force; and <\/p><p>5.  Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy. <\/p><p>While the first two Pillars focus on building economic resilience through greater productivity and innovation, the remaining Pillars emphasise the role that wider social policies have in shaping how Ireland&rsquo;s managers and workers must adapt for the changes ahead and how we can move towards decarbonisation.<\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland addresses challenges to participation in the labour force by developing and implementing a range of new initiatives aimed at easing barriers to entry into the workforce including investment in Early Learning and Care, providing tailored activation and training supports and generating attractive employment opportunities including intelligent working arrangements. <\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland sets out a number of medium-term Ambitions concerning Increasing Participation in the Labour Force as follows:<\/p><p>4.1Encourage participation in the labour force through high-quality Early Learning and Care <\/p><p>4.2Foster participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions<\/p><p>4.3Improve incentives to participate in the labour force<\/p><p>4.4Encourage adult dependents and beneficiaries of other full-time welfare payments to engage in activation, enter and\/or stay in the workforce<\/p><p>4.5Undertake promotional campaigns to encourage greater levels of participation in the labour force<\/p><p>As the nature of work and society changes, the way we organise work must also. As noted above, one of the Ambitions in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 is to foster participation in the labour market through flexible working solutions. Flexible working solutions, including part-time, remote working, compressed hours, home-working and job sharing, could improve labour market participation, particularly amongst women with young children, as well as those with caring responsibilities, older people and people with disabilities. Flexible working can also provide solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so.<\/p><p>Flexible can work assist in the development of an inclusive society. In a tightening labour market, such as that in Ireland, offering flexible working options can benefit employers, workers and wider society. We already have many companies in Ireland who offer remote working to their employees and this trend is only going to increase in the future. For workers, flexible work solutions such as remote working can mean substantial savings in terms of rents and property costs while also reducing the need to commute leading to a better work-life balance. For businesses, intelligent working arrangements can support staff retention, a more motivated workforce with fewer sick days and greater productivity as well as the opportunity to draw workers from a larger pool of talent. <\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland 2019 assigns my Department to conduct research on the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, and the attitudes towards such working arrangements, as well as the factors which inhibit employers and employees to partake in such arrangements. Under Future Jobs Ireland 2019, the Department of Justice and Equality will develop guidance to support employers in offering more family-friendly working options and promoting the adoption of flexible and or remote working solutions and structures for parents. In addition to this, the Department of Justice and Equality will commence a national consultation on the extension of flexible working options to all employees. The findings of the research and the outcome of the national consultation may lead to the development of further, new deliverables for inclusion in the next stage, Future Jobs Ireland 2020.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., is responsible for employment legislation. I understand that in view of the legislation already in place, it is not clear at this juncture what specific additional legislative provisions would be required to regulate remote working.  However, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection continuously monitors existing employment rights legislation to ensure that it continues to be relevant and fit for purpose and is updated to reflect international developments at European Union, Court of Justice and International Labour Organisation level. Where any new legislation is proposed, that Department engages in extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders, to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights of workers and the interests of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC06000"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[20534\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400055#WRC06100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress that has been made by her Department and agencies under her remit in driving job creation in the mid-west region; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>A total of 14,700 more people are in employment in the Mid-West at the end of 2018 than in 2015 when the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative was first launched.

In the event of an emergency at a National level or threats posed by an emerging emergency situation, the Strategic Emergency Management National Structures and Framework, approved by Government in July 2017, outlines the Lead Government Department principle and how this is applied across a \"whole of Government\" approach to managing such responses. Such responses are normally led by the convening of the National Emergency Coordination Group (NECG) by the Lead Department concerned. The lead Departmental responsibilities are outlined in the Annex A of this publically available document regarding the various emergency incident types. A lead Department may, therefore, convene the NECG at short notice to address and coordinate our responses to any National level threats or actual emergencies that may occur.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, since 2006, the Framework for Major Emergency Management has allocated primary responsibility for responding at a local or regional level to specific emergencies, such as those caused by fires, including wildfires. The responses to such emergencies rests with the designated principal response agencies, namely, the relevant Local Authority (including the Fires Services), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Health Service Executive. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces provide assistance, on an as available basis, to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of any natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority role.  The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed, on request, in such circumstances to any emergencies that may arise.  <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, the principal response agency designated to respond to fire emergencies is the Fire Service, under the responsibility of the relevant Local Authority. Mechanisms to request support at a local, regional and national level are well established and may be made by the Chief Fire Officer and the Local Authority under the Major Emergency Management Framework through the National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for such assistance. Such Aid to the Civil Authority requests are actioned immediately within existing arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of requests during the recent Donegal fires, the Air Corps moved immediately to assemble the necessary personnel and the required pilots and crew with the necessary training on the use of the specialised firefighting equipment (bambi bucket) as well as deployment of other specialist personnel. This took some time as some of the crew assembled from their time off, from a distance, but this was achieved as quickly as possible in the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The policy lead in relation to fire related emergencies, particularly those that require a National-level response, rests with National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and that Department has the lead responsibility for the Major Emergency Management Framework, which is currently under review by the National Steering Group chaired by that Department.<\/p>  <p>  As Chair of the Government Task Force, I am satisfied that the responses provided by the State to such incidents are provided in a coordinated way and that the tried and tested arrangements work well in response to such emergencies.

I was present when Vice-President Dombrovskis shared that response at the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle on 31 January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  From the perspective of both EU level and Ireland&rsquo;s individual decarbonisation targets, the attainment of emission reduction obligations under the EU 2030 framework will require considerable levels of sustainable investment. As the scale of the investment is beyond what can be facilitated through public sector funding, the mobilisation and reorientation of private capital flows towards sustainable development will be vital.\u00a0 In that regard, the vision informed by the high level report as set out in the Commission&rsquo;s Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, to embed sustainability throughout Europe&rsquo;s financial system and provide transparency to market participants and investors is a welcome development. <\/p>  <p>  To take forward the vision outlined the Action Plan, in May 2018 the Commission brought forward a package of legislative proposals to implement several key actions as contained in its Action Plan. The proposals which are still being progressed at EU level, and on which Ireland has being engaging constructively include: \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  1) A\u00a0proposal for a regulation to establish a unified classification framework ('taxonomy'), to determine what can be considered an environmentally sustainable economic activity;<\/p>  <p>  2) A\u00a0proposal for a regulation on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks and amending Directive\u00a0(EU) 2016\/2341 and;<\/p>  <p>  3) A\u00a0proposal relating to the creation of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The latter two proposals have been approved by the European Parliament, while the taxonomy proposal is currently being progressed at Working Party level. <\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, Sustainable Finance is also an area which the Irish Government has been active. Sustainable finance is one of three cross-cutting priorities in the Government&rsquo;s new strategy for the international financial services sector, Ireland for Finance, which the Government published in April.

Regulation under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 is managed through the protection of professional titles rather than by restricting practice. The Department of Health has proposed the designation of the professions &lsquo;Counsellor&rsquo; and &lsquo;Psychotherapist&rsquo;, each to have its own register. The use of protected titles is restricted to those granted registration. This has raised the question of the status of the title of Guidance Counsellor and continued right to use that title in education and training settings.   <\/p>  <p>  The role of Guidance Counsellor in the education and training sector is a separate and distinct role to that of counsellor or psychotherapist. Guidance in schools refers to a range of learning experiences provided in a developmental sequence, that assist students to develop self-management skills which will lead to effective choices and decisions about their lives. It encompasses the three separate, but interlinked, areas of personal and social development, educational guidance and career guidance&rdquo;. In an adult guidance context i.e. the AEGS, guidance is defined as facilitating people &ldquo;&hellip;to manage their own educational, training, occupational, personal, social, and life choices so that they reach their full potential and contribute to the development of a better society&rdquo;. These definitions capture the importance of the Guidance Counsellor&rsquo;s role in supporting personal and social, educational and career development. They also highlight the role of guidance in facilitating decision-making and life choices and promoting wellbeing.   <\/p>  <p>  Counselling in schools may include personal counselling, educational counselling, career counselling or combinations of these. Counselling occurs only within the guidance context to support the individual student or adult client in personal, social, educational and career development and where necessary at moments of personal crisis. Guidance Counsellors employed within the education and training sector are guided by the DES requirements  to operate within their professional  competence and boundaries and to make referrals to  personal counselling and psychotherapy as and when appropriate.   <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a regulation or statutory instrument recognising the title of Guidance Counsellor. Recognising the important role played by Guidance Counsellors in schools and other settings, my Department has made a submission to the Department of Health seeking a derogation of the title of Guidance Counsellor from regulation. This is the appropriate route to take towards protection of the title Guidance Counsellor for use in the education and training sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400060#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400060#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[20439\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400060#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will publish the 2009 report by a company (details supplied) on school transport services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann without redactions in view of the time that has passed since it was first published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department.

Following extensive research and consultation with schools, parents, SNAs and other stakeholders, a report was submitted last year.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the SNA scheme was working really well particularly for younger children and for certain type of care needs, for example, mobility and toileting.  It also found that a new and more widely based model of support involving both education and health supports was needed to meet the range of student need currently presenting in our schools. The review made a number of recommendations including the way SNA support is allocated to schools and the need to build school capacity through training.  Overall, the Council recommended a new service model, the School Inclusion Model that would involve the provision of speech and language, occupational and behavioural therapies in schools and the development of a national nursing scheme to cater for children with the most complex medical needs.  The overall aim of the model is to improve outcomes for children by ensuring each child receives the right support at the right time.<\/p>  <p>  The Government approved a pilot of the new Model in 75 schools for the 2019\/20 school year which will be independently evaluated.

The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school. <\/p><p>My Department has no control over the allocation process to schools and is not in a position to influence the allocation process in light of the fact that the NCSE is an independent statutory body.  In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource and allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.<\/p><p>In respect of job security, the supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed. These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 , and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school \/ ETB.<\/p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2018\/2019 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0034\/2018 which issued on 17 May 2017 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0034\/2018 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400062#WRK02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[20709\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400062#WRK02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if information regarding to the way in which special needs assistants' bank of 72 hours should be used and on which tasks could be circulated immediately to schools nationally; and if these hours can be brought into line with those of teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>All Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.

There were also 2,460 prisoners serving sentences between 3 and 12 months released to take part in the Community Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) project which is in operation since 2016 involves an intense and highly collaborative approach by agencies to the supervision and rehabilitation of prolific offenders in particular areas of Dublin and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014, was enacted in April 2014 and commenced on 11 January 2016. It will ensure that there are sufficient alternatives available to courts to reduce the need to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of fines.   <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the total number of prisoners in custody on 14 May 2019 was 4,016 compared with a bed capacity of 4,244.  This represents an occupancy level of 95%.  I can also advise the Deputy that according to the most recent snapshot of the prison population taken on 30 April 2019 the provisional figure for committal to prison is 3,165, which is an increase of 422 or 15.4% from the same time last year when the figure for committals from 1 January 2018 to 30 April was 2,743. <\/p>  <p>  It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service does not have the option of refusing committals and must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts. The prison system is, of course, subject to peaks and troughs.  Numbers are particularly high when the Courts are at their busiest, giving rise to a high number of committals. As a result, almost all of the closed institutions are operating at or near full capacity.  <\/p>  <p>  Where the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum capacity in any prison, my officials make every effort to deal with this through a combination of inter-prison transfers and structured Temporary Release. Decisions in relation to temporary release are considered on a case by case basis and the safety of the public is paramount when those decisions are made. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that plans are advanced for the re-opening of accommodation not currently being used within the system, including the re-opening of the Training Unit which itself will provide approximately an additional 90 spaces. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, an audit of existing accommodation is underway, in order to identify where additional spaces can be brought on stream with the potential to provide in excess of an additional 100 spaces.<\/p>  <p>  I have also recently signed a construction contract for the female prison in Limerick as well as a new wing to Limerick male prison. Together, they will provide 130 new spaces.<\/p>  <p>  I regret the reversal of the trend towards lower prisoner numbers, however, the Deputy will appreciate that I must be respectful of the independence of the judiciary and their total discretion in deciding whether or not to imprison persons appearing before the Courts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400063#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Judgments","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400063#WRL02600"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[20351\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400063#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 273 of 29 November 2017 and 168 of 25 October 2018, if he will report on developments in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>As I indicated in previous responses to Parliamentary Questions from the Deputy on this matter, I am aware of the case referred to.<\/p><p>I would however again point out to that I was not a party to the legal proceedings referred to.<\/p><p>I am informed that the Chief State Solicitor's Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to engage in relation to the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400063#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400063#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[20391\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400063#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a project (details supplied) will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the effective and efficient use of the resources at his disposal.

The Group's Report was approved and published by the Government on 20 March, 2019. The Report contained a significant number of recommendations concerning all aspects of gambling activity. In particular, it recommended that future responsibility for licensing and regulation of all forms of gambling, including online gambling, rest with a proposed new gambling regulatory authority.<\/p>  <p>  Work in this regard is underway in my Department. This is a complex area and we must be certain that any reforms will be achievable and effective. At the time of publication of this Report, the Taoiseach indicated that work on a revised General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill, taking account of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, would likely take a period of about 18 months to bring to completion.<\/p>  <p>  The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019 is an interim measure and amends the 1956 Act but it is not intended to change or extend its general scope.

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility.

This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. <\/p><p>I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTradeIreland to help SMEs prepare for the challenges associated with Brexit. <\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. <\/p><p>In addition, over 590 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 651 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. <\/p><p>As of February 2019, the LEOs are also offering customs training workshops to support in businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. 199 Participants have attended Customs Training.<\/p><p>InterTradeIreland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. To date, more than 7,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  <\/p><p>ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,476 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,310 have been approved. <\/p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched in March of 2018, provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  <\/p><p>As at 10th May, there have been 614 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 557 have been approved to date by SBCI. 124 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;27.77m.<\/p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was launched on the 17 April, and provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. The Scheme is currently accepting eligibility applications. Since the 17 of April 115 applications have been received, 108 of which have so far been deemed eligible.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p><p>Over 5,100 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 194 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 233 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. <\/p><p>EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,200 Customs Insights Course participants.<\/p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.

Last year, for example, 56% of all net new jobs created by IDA client firms were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, experienced FDI-supported employment growth. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. This amounts to 58% of all IDA-supported employment and represents the highest number of people ever employed in the regions by Agency client companies.<\/p>  <p>  While there were no new FDI-supported jobs created in Cavan in 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County.

Over that period, Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath each hosted one site visit. Information on site visits for the second quarter of 2019 will be available later this year. While the IDA will continue to promote and showcase locations in these Counties to prospective investors, it is important to remember that the decision as to where to invest is always taken by the companies themselves. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of Budget 2019 I allocated an additional &euro;10 million for the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme (RPP).

These facilities can help to encourage overseas investors to consider regional areas and I am confident that the ATU in Knockaconny, once complete, will lead to further investment and job creation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the RPP, the IDA targets further investment for the wider area through its office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. The Agency has also recently appointed a new Regional Business Development Manager for the North-East Region. As part of its strategy to promote the area, the IDA is focusing on specific sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.

I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness we must preserve fiscal sustainability, maximise investment in infrastructure and talent, maintain cost competitiveness, and drive innovation and productivity across all economic sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs 2019, launched in March, is a whole of Government framework designed to improve our economy&rsquo;s resilience in the face of emerging and future challenges. It sets out 26 &lsquo;ambitions&rsquo; to 2025 across five pillars in the areas of innovation; productivity; skills and talent; participation; and transitioning to a low carbon economy. <\/p>  <p>  Along with Project Ireland 2040, Global Ireland 2025 and the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming All of Government Climate Plan, Future Jobs represents an integrated approach to prepare for the opportunities and challenge of the future economy.<\/p>  <p>  A range of specific deliverables in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 aim to enhance the business environment and improve competitiveness, as well as other factors, that contribute to specific sectoral cost challenges. For example:<\/p>  <p>  -  On credit and financial costs, the Future Growth Loan Scheme will provide long term debt financing for strategic investments. This scheme will offer loans to SMEs for a period of 8 to 10 years with an interest rate of 4.5% for loans up to &euro;249,000 and 3.5% and less for loans greater than or equal to &euro;250,000. It will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses and the primary agriculture and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment;<\/p>  <p>  -  On legal services, new business models for legal services will be introduced, including new legal partnerships and limited liability partnerships;<\/p>  <p>  -  On construction, an implementation plan for actions to stimulate construction sector productivity will be delivered, including greater deployment of Building Information Modelling. <\/p>  <p>  As a small open economy, we must never underestimate the importance of maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring that the cost of doing business does not impede this. This requires us to have mutually supporting policies in place. In this regard, Future Jobs Ireland is an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s over-arching plan for the future of the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[20891\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which the development programme of the IDA continues to develop to maximise advantages for job creation and economic competitiveness on international markets; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[20897\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she continues to promote Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment, with particular reference to the ability of the State to compete effectively with all other countries in the EU and outside in which the greatest competition is likely to come from; if particular advantages and disadvantages have been identified from an Irish perspective; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 259 together.<\/p>  <p>  Retaining and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) remains fundamentally important to our economic model.

These new Plans build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017.<\/p>  <p>  Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and, there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the Future Jobs Ireland initiative. <\/p>  <p>  They are two-year, focused Plans, which set out a series of prioritised &lsquo;Strategic Objectives&rsquo; that will help to drive business development and expansion in all of the regions. The Plans are also &lsquo;live&rsquo; documents, so new initiatives can be adopted during their operation by the regional stakeholders working together. These stakeholders include: Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.<\/p>  <p>  The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential and add value to the ongoing core work of the enterprise agencies and other bodies. <\/p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Plans enable continued dialogue with the enterprise sector in the regions. Each of the Regional Steering Committees established to oversee the implementation of the Plans is chaired by a representative from the business sector, which ensures that the enterprise perspective is at the forefront of the Committee&rsquo;s work. The Committees also include a number of &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo; and business representative organisations, such as the Chambers and Ibec, who are involved in driving implementation of many of the actions. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside the collaborative structures that I have put in place through the Regional Enterprise Plans, the enterprise agencies and the LEOs continue to work directly with businesses on the ground in all regions.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and the economic growth across all regions.  In 2018, two-thirds (64 percent) of new Enterprise Ireland jobs were created outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in every county are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.  In February I announced very good results from the LEOs Offices around the country. Overall, they supported the creation of 3,656 new jobs (net) in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019.  These investments are a combination of new name investments, expansions from existing overseas companies in Ireland and R&amp;D investments.  Over 2018, all regions saw increases in IDA employment, with the Midlands region experiencing the highest growth at 14 percent. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the Government has put several funding streams in place to support enterprise and regional development, including my Department&rsquo;s &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund, and the Project Ireland 2040, that include in particular, the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund and the Rural and Urban Regeneration and Development Funds.  <\/p>  <p>  Guided by the new Regional Enterprise Plans, the regions are well positioned to build on successes to date and to continue to see the benefits and results of collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development in the regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Innovation Fund Ireland","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP02400"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[20893\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which innovation continues to be a feature of enterprise and investment here; if she remains satisfied that new enterprises have adequate access to innovation technology and-or appropriate assistance from the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>Innovation 2020, Ireland's strategy for research and development, science and technology, was launched in December 2015 and articulates Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to become a Global Innovation Leader. The strategy aims to build on the significant successes which have seen Ireland dramatically improve its innovation performance globally.<\/p><p>Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) is globally recognised as the key economic differentiator and, as such, a very important feature of enterprise and investment in Ireland. <\/p><p>RDI enables Irish companies to make innovative products and services that are competitive and more novel than those in global markets. However, for an SME investment in RDI can be costly in terms of time, personnel and budget. It also requires a focus beyond the day to day challenges of running a business with limited resources. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) has a role in this regard to de-risk such RDI so that companies will develop new and improved products and services and achieve the required exports to allow economic growth. This is done either by supporting companies to do RDI within the company, or by collaborating with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) or by sourcing \/ licensing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities. These supports all help companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.<\/p><p>SMEs qualify for all of EI&rsquo;s funding programmes and a limited number of these programmes are also open to FDI companies. These supports all help companies develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth and are detailed below:  <\/p><p><b>-  In-Company RDI<\/b>- supporting the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market.

In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled indigenous workforce to serve the needs of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is seeking to advance this goal under the framework of two overarching skills development strategies:<\/p>  <p>  - Ireland's National Skills Strategy 2025, which sets out a vision of how Ireland can continue to develop relevant skills and ensure that the supply of skills is activated and effectively used; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Action Plan for Education 2019, the annual implementation plan for this vision.<\/p>  <p>  The enhancement of skills and the development and attraction of talent also forms a key pillar of Future Jobs Ireland, the new whole of Government strategy for driving Ireland's development as a resilient, innovative, and globally connected economy, capable of coping with technological and other transformational changes.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's sophisticated skills architecture is key to identifying and responding to skills gaps as identified by enterprise and education and training providers, and therefore supporting the objectives set out in these strategies. It is made up of the following fora, all of which include representation either from my Department or its enterprise and research and innovation agencies:<\/p>  <p>  - National Skills Council (NSC): The NSC was established in 2017. It provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of identified skills needs, while also enhancing the response to and delivery of these needs by education and training providers. The Council draws on the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS, and the network of Regional Skills Fora. <\/p>  <p>  - Regional Skills Fora: A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora foster close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and regional enterprise. The Fora provide a cohesive education led structure for employers and the further education and higher education system to work together in addressing the skills needs of their regions.<\/p>  <p>  - Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN): The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business and trade union communities, relevant Government Departments, enterprise agencies, and education and training agencies. It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employer needs. My Department provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.  <\/p>  <p>  High level ICT skills have been a key concern for the EGFSN over the past decade, in particular through the undertaking of skills demand forecast studies that have helped inform the various ICT Skills Action Plans published since 2012. The EGFSN recently published the latest of these studies, Forecasting the Future Demand for High Level ICT Skills in Ireland, 2017-2022. <\/p>  <p>  This research- a qualitative and quantitative overview of the market and demand for high level ICT skills in Ireland over the coming years- helped inform the strategic direction and scale of the third ICT Skills Action Plan, Technology Skills 2022, which I launched along with the Minister for Education and Skills earlier this year. <\/p>  <p>  The new plan sets out the supply measures the Government and wider ICT skills stakeholder community have committed to in the years to 2022, in order to meet the scale of demand identified by the EGFSN. At official level, my Department is involved in the High Level Steering Group responsible for monitoring the implementation of  Technology Skills 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Through the skills architecture and implementation of the strategies mentioned above, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills will continue to ensure that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains available to meet the requirements of the high tech industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP03000"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[20895\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400067#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to encourage start-up enterprises in all regions nationally; the issues to date identified as being likely to impede progress; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>My Department has a strong focus of developing indigenous businesses.

Officials in my Department are in regular contact with their DfE counterparts to ensure the body is supported and equipped to carry out this important work.

Once that report is received in the Department, I will give further consideration to the requests made by the forum that the Deputy refers to.<\/p>  <p>  I have been aware of the issues surrounding sodium valproate use in pregnancy since early 2017, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiated its most recent review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. The risk reduction measures recommended by the EMA on foot of its previous review in 2014 were fully implemented in Ireland; prior to this, there were no specific restrictions over and above those listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet for healthcare professionals and the patient information leaflet. As with any medicine, these documents were regularly updated as new data emerged about the medicine and its potential side effects. The study referred to by the Deputy suggests that the association between valproate use in pregnancy and congenital malformations in children was firmly established by 2005. The SmPC and patient leaflets used in 2005 reflect this association, and the patient leaflet includes specific information for women who become pregnant, or could become pregnant, while taking this medicine, based on the increased risk of having a child with an abnormality. <\/p>  <p>  An assessment conducted by the HSE estimates that between 153 and 341 children will have experienced a major congenital malformation and up to 1,250 children will have experienced some form of neurodevelopmental delay following exposure to sodium valproate in utero between 1975 and 2015. It should be noted that this assessment was subject to a number of assumptions and limitations, and relied heavily on international data when developing estimates of the numbers of children who may be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400068#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[20330\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the healthcare assessment and needs of children suspected of having foetal valproate syndrome will be prioritised; and if there will be no delay in diagnosis and service provision","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

These timeframes are not statutory but, rather, reflect the Department's overall policy in dealing with these matters.  In relation to the initial assessment of a protected disclosure, the Deputy correctly refers to the timeframe of 21 days within which the person who has made the disclosure should be advised as to whether the matter requires an investigation.  The specific case referred to relates to a body under the aegis of the Department of Health.  Regrettably, in this case it was not possible to meet this timeline, given the extensive nature and complexity of the disclosure made.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that this protected disclosure has been given significant attention by the Department.  Given the nature of this protected disclosure and its overlap with other matters, it was decided that it would be more appropriate to make arrangements for an external review.  This is in keeping with the Policies and Procedures document.  A procurement process has been completed to source an appropriate reviewer.  The Department is currently engaged in finalising the terms of reference for the review.  To assist in the process I understand that the Department has been in contact with the person who made this protected disclosure and that, most recently, a significant amount of additional information has been provided which is currently being examined by the Department.  These papers will be passed to the external investigator to assist in finalising the terms of reference of the investigation.  It is intended that the person who made this protected disclosure will also have sight of the terms of reference of the investigation prior to its commencement.  The Department fully appreciates the desire on the part of the person making the disclosure to have the matter concluded and the delay in doing so is regretted.  The person who made the disclosure has been updated on specific developments and the Department's plans and this will continue.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the carrying out of the review, the policy states that an investigation should be carried out &lsquo;without delay&rsquo;.  It is also clear that the investigation should be consistent with investigatory procedures and should embody principles of natural justice.  There is no precise timescale or steps required for investigations under the policy as it is recognised that this will depend on the nature and extent of the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the above, I do not believe it is necessary to amend the record.  While it was not possible to meet the suggested timelines in this policy, the necessary steps have been complied with and arrangements are underway to conduct an external review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[20392\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide information relating to maternity units (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR02100"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[20409\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding has been sanctioned for planned refurbishment and upgrade works at St. Joseph's and Ramelton community hospitals; and if so, when works will commence","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR02400"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[20412\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400069#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an MRI scan will be arranged for a person (details supplied); and if the matter will be expedited.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The CervicalCheck programme has agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. In addition, agreement has been reached with the laboratory with the largest backlog to process tests based on a HPV initial testing model; i.e. HPV testing will be carried out on samples prior to cytology. I am advised that this approach was chosen as the most effective way to process all outstanding tests based on prioritising women most at risk.<\/p>  <p>  However, the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. It has said that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the reduction of turnaround times is a priority.  With the programme now back to normal call-recall procedures, lab turnaround times are improving and the HSE reports that more than half of tests are being returned in 9 weeks. However, they can take as long as 33 weeks, and this remains a significant challenge. The HSE is continuing to work actively to reduce these turnaround times. In order to do so, it has been undertaking a global search for additional laboratory capacity to support the programme. Additional capacity has now been identified and the HSE is currently engaged in intensive negotiations to finalise commercial arrangements, in order to enable it to incorporate this capacity into the CervicalCheck programme. <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring the programme is fully supported, in the interests of public health, remains my priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400070#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[20438\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400070#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the HPV screening programme that was due to begin in September 2018 will be rolled out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>The introduction of primary HPV screening is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally.

Lyme disease is a notifiable disease in Ireland since 2012.  Lyme disease is a well-recognised infection, which is familiar to GPs and hospital specialists (especially those specialising in Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Dermatology Cardiology and Microbiology).  Accordingly, such specialists would be very familiar with how to manage such patients, and as a result, all physicians deal with Lyme disease, as they would with any other infectious disease for which they have responsibility.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and the Department of Health have highlighted the issue of Lyme disease, and how to prevent tick bites and Lyme disease, since 2008.  The HPSC publishes significant amounts of information on Lyme disease on its website -<i>hpsc.ie<\/i>- for the general public and health professionals.  In addition, Public Health physicians give talks at medical conferences to junior physicians as part of their continuing medical education, bringing the issue of Lyme disease (along with the other wide range of infectious diseases) to the attention of established physicians and doctors in training.  Also, the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Day each year to highlight this issue and is constantly adding new material to its website.  This year a Lyme Awareness Day was held on Monday 29 April.<\/p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee to look at ways of increasing public awareness - that Subcommittee is due to report before the summer.  Part of the work of the Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee is to ensure that all GPs are familiar with identifying and managing Lyme disease.<\/p><p>Tests used in Ireland conform to all international standards.  Clinical laboratories in Ireland operate to the highest quality standards.  Testing for Lyme disease in such laboratories is to an internationally accredited level.  Microbiologists in all major centres would be familiar with Lyme testing and the tests they use are internationally recognised and eminently effective at differentiating those who truly have Lyme disease from those who truly have not.  As testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in all major hospitals in Ireland there is no need for people to travel to other EU Member States for diagnosis or treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400073#WRV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":835,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400073#WRV02300"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[20715\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400073#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if treatment for a person (details supplied) will be approved under the treatment abroad scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":837,"content":"<p>The HSE operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) which allows public patients to be referred to another EU\/EEA Member State for treatment, in their public healthcare system, that is not available in Ireland, subject to qualifying criteria.

I am advised that this approach was chosen as the most effective way to process all outstanding tests based on prioritising women most at risk.<\/p>  <p>  However, the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years.

Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on the sector, given its unique exposure to the UK market, which accounted for 38% (&euro;5.2 billion) of agri-food exports last year. <\/p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties which would face Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture food and fishery sectors.  Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the impact of the UK tariff regime as announced would have had a significant impact on beef prices and on beef farm incomes, as a result. <\/p>  <p>  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector. I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agri-food and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308\/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  Obviously, as Minister, I have no role when it comes to prices paid to producers but it is important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a period of depressed prices since last autumn with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.  I also note that prices have started to increase week-on-week recently, mainly due to tightening supply of cattle and the outlook is that this will continue.  Market intelligence also points towards other factors such as the presence of African Swine Fever in China affecting their pork output, thereby strengthening the demand for beef in a market to which Ireland already has access.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the on-going market disturbance, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.<\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025. It is crucial that we all continue to work together. I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the RDP, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400076#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400076#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[20363\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400076#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of non-EU maize in euro and volume imported here annually over the 2016 to 2018 period; and if his attention has been drawn to the negative impact this has on the income of tillage growers here that are left with stores full of barley due to the importation of feed.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":951,"content":"<p>The following table outlines the volume of non-EU maize imported into Ireland over the last three years. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Tonnes<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>689,545<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>1,042,463<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>1,485,702<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Figures in terms of the value of maize imports are not available.<\/p><p>The majority of maize imported is used in the animal feed industry.

Therefore, the details requested will only be known following engagements by these financial institutions with the Commission and the EIB.   <\/p>  <p>  In recent years, I have introduced a number of initiatives on access to finance. The Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed by my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in partnership with the Department of Finance, the SBCI and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. The loans will be competitively priced and will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.   <\/p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security.

Co-benefits for road safety may also arise. However, negative economic impacts, reduced fuel tax revenue, and longer travel times are noteworthy concerns. It is also possible that a proportion of the motorway traffic would divert on to secondary networks as a result of a reduced speed limit. Reviews to the design speed for existing infrastructure and speed enforcement procedures would be required in light of any proposal to lower speed limits. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that reducing speed limits on motorways has been identified as a possible longer term transport mitigation measure in the National Mitigation Plan (Measure T24). My Department officials estimated the impact of reducing maximum speed limits on motorways from 120km\/h to 110km\/h for cars\/vans and from 90km\/h to 80km\/h for heavy goods vehicles compared to current speed limits and estimated that cumulative total greenhouse gas emission reduction savings of 1,881 tkCO2 were possible over the period 2017-2030. <\/p>  <p>  Implementing such a mitigation measure would require a full detailed review of the potential economic, safety and societal implications as well as an assessment of the likely environmental impact. Concerns also exist regarding the potential erosion of the considerable economic benefit derived from substantial motorway investments made to date. It should also be highlighted that National Strategic Outcome 2 (Enhanced Regional Accessibility) in the National Planning Framework commits to improving average journey times for connectivity reasons. The Framework targets an average inter-urban speed of 90kph. A reduced motorway speed limit may be in conflict with to this aim. <\/p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that actual fuel consumption benefits of lower speed limits for motorway drivers is dependent on a number of external factors such as vehicle types; driving patterns; the frequency of speeding; road load patterns; and congestion levels. I am given to understand that carbon savings from lower speeds can also vary markedly depending on engine characteristics; vehicle weight; distances travelled; and supplementary equipment such as rear mounted storage racks or even taxi signs.<\/p>  <p>  While some limited research has been conducted at EU level and in other jurisdictions, there continues to be a lack of official and scientifically robust data on this issue. I am, however, committed to the ongoing exploration of all mechanisms available to reduce emissions and encourage more individuals to move towards decarbonising the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is also noteworthy that the vehicles we drive and the fuels that power them are themselves steadily becoming less carbon intensive. The penetration of renewable biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years.  In 2017 alone, biofuels blended in fuel reduced CO2 emissions from vehicles by an estimated 457 kilotonnes. A further important role is played by ever more stringent efficient standards for vehicles. Such developments will erode emissions reduction benefits of reducing speed limits. Through better technology, improved efficiency and higher biofuel use vehicle emissions are being decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400079#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann Services","counter":1064,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400079#WRBB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1065,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[21062\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400079#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of scheduled services that use private contractors on each route of the Bus &Eacute;ireann network.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":1066,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[20719\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400079#WRBB01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of scheduled services that use private contractors on each route of the Bus &Eacute;ireann network.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1067,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 and 434 together.<\/p><p>The issue raised is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the company for direct reply.

The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme will ultimately replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.  To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on\/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.  <\/p>  <p>  Parents who do not qualify for an enhanced hours subsidy may still qualify for a standard-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 15 hours per week).  This approach reflects the evidence on the strong benefits of early childhood care and education for young children and, particularly, those from disadvantaged backgrounds, but also the evidence that these benefits are &ndash; in most cases &ndash; realised with part-time participation. The cap of 15 hours will provide for continuity between the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE scheme, whereby it will be possible for a child to commence subsidised sessional care before the age of 3 and to continue in such care without disruption or a change of hours as they transition into the ECCE scheme.  For children in school and pre-school, the standard hours subsidy will still entitle them to up to 15 hours of subsidised childcare out of term time while, during term time, child development needs will be met through school and pre-school. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note the provision of Educational Welfare services across the country.  Many of these services offer after-school activities. Where a parent is at home and not in work or training, and where the NCS therefore provides 15 hours of school age childcare in non-term time only, certain children will have access to educational welfare after-school activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400081#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme Implementation","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400081#WRDD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[20701\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400081#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will consider referrals to the affordable childcare scheme from other educational practitioners in cases of vulnerable children in which Tusla is not involved.","asker":"1330","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1145,"content":"<p>The Childcare Support Act, which was enacted on 2<sup>nd<\/sup>July 2018, specifies five statutory bodies with which the Minister may make agreements in relation to referral procedures for free or additional childcare.

It will ultimately replace all previous targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted subsidies. The development of this scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare to families throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>When the scheme is introduced in October 2019, many families will become eligible for childcare subsidies for the first time and many more families will qualify for increased levels of subsidy.  The Scheme also provides a vital platform for future investment in the sector. This is a very positive development for the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector.<\/p><p>It is important to note up front that ECCE, the scheme Government invests most in, remains as is for providers, with no changes for the sector. <\/p><p>The new National Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, recognising that childcare needs are different for each family.  In creating a single, national scheme, it was important to recognise these differences and create a system that could respond to them without affecting service operations for providers.  For this reason, subsidies will be awarded as an hourly rate, along with a maximum number of hours for which that rate is payable.  The hourly rate of subsidy illustrates to parents their level of subsidy and will not affect service operations.<\/p><p>Parents and providers will continue to work together, as they currently do, to decide on the amount of childcare that is needed and can be provided.  Providers will continue to set their own fees, sessions and admissions policies; there is no change to this.  The scheme will pay subsidies based on the hours of care agreed between the provider and the parent, up to the maximum hours awarded to the parent. Providers are not required to change their operations to run their services on an hourly basis.<\/p><p>As with the current targeted subsidy schemes, subsidies will be awarded for a set period of time, normally twelve months.  As such, providers will have visibility of the annual subsidy payments applicable to each child in their service, subject to the child regularly using the childcare place. This is similar to the current CCSP scheme which an increasing number of services have signed up to, it is also similar to the arrangements in place for the TEC schemes. In these latter schemes currently, services are not guaranteed a set income for the year, but they can continue to earn it if they retain the same number of children attending for the same hours overall. As such, these schemes are already based on attendance, not merely on enrolment, or attendance during a particular snapshot.<\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will have rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is continuously absent from the service, or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  These rules will be child-centred, fair and proportionate, clear and consistent and will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  The rules will not disadvantage services for what would be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.<\/p><p>On 11th March, I launched a communications campaign for the National Childcare Scheme.  The campaign encompasses a major nationwide training programme for providers.  I would encourage all providers to sign up for a local training session on the new website -<i>www.ncs.ie -<\/i>so that they can learn more about the operation of the scheme, including the rules on attendance and payment.  <\/p><p>With regard to the viability of childcare facilities, I am committed to increasing investment in the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector. Over the last four budgets, my Department has increased funding for the sector by an unprecedented 117%. A significant proportion of this funding has been targeted at families who use community childcare services, thus assisting with the sustainability issues faced by some services. The National Childcare Scheme will further increase investment in childcare and will reduce the top-up many parents have to pay for their childcare. This will have corresponding benefits for providers. The National Childcare Scheme is also expected to increase demand for services, thereby supporting services to operate efficiently and at full capacity.<\/p><p>For any services facing issues with financial sustainability, my Department oversees an integrated Case Management system which is administered by Pobal.  This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance.  Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges; these may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.

Under Section 220 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, Child Benefit is payable to the person with whom a qualified child normally resides.  Regulations governing normal residence for Child Benefit purposes are contained in S.I. 142\/2007 (Article 159) and they provide inter alia for the following: <\/p>  <p>  1. In the event that a qualified child is resident with both mother and father, he or she will be regarded as normally residing with the mother (or step-mother);<\/p>  <p>  2.

Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there. <\/p>  <p>  In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act. Housing authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the housing authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer to local authority social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400084#WRGG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":1283,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400084#WRGG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":494,"qnumall":"[20479\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400084#WRGG02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address a matter regarding Rebuilding Ireland funding (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1285,"content":"<p>The issue referred to is a matter for Kerry County Council to consider, as it is the Council that identifies projects that are eligible and are to be prioritised in terms of the delivery of new social housing in their area. <\/p><p>Funding under Rebuilding Ireland is, in general, targeted towards the provision of permanent new social homes for those on housing waiting lists. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400084#WRGG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Data","counter":1286,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400084#WRGG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1287,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[20511\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400084#WRGG02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the date the non-principal private residence charge was introduced; the effective date for the charge for each year; the amounts now payable in respect of each year while the charge was in existence in circumstances in which persons have not paid such a charge to date; the amount now due by an individual in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1288,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, provides the legislative basis for the Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) charge.

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, Cost Rental can make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.<\/p>  <p>  To support the introduction of affordable housing, including Cost Rental, the Government has made &euro;310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure, under the Serviced Sites Fund, over the next three years.<\/p>  <p>  Two Cost Rental 'path-finder' projects are currently being supported by my Department. Firstly, the Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and two Approved Housing Bodies (Respond and T&uacute;ath) are working on a project at the Enniskerry Road, Dublin, which will deliver 50 Cost Rental homes. Tenders for the project have been assessed and the contract is due to be awarded shortly, with construction expected to commence by the end of this month.  An application submitted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for Serviced Sites Fund grant funding associated with the project has been successful, with a resulting budget of c. &euro;5 million.  <\/p>  <p>  The second planned pathfinder project, at Emmet Road, Inchicore, Dublin 8, is estimated to have the potential to accommodate circa. 470 homes in a high quality development.  The anticipated tenure mix is 30% social and 70% cost rental.  Initial estimates of the St. Michael&rsquo;s project by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) indicated that rents of between 15-25% below market are achievable.  The European Investment Bank is also working on this project in terms of financial and advisory services. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Land Development Agency is examining the potential to deliver cost rental homes at scale from its land port-folio and the broader State land bank, and constructive engagement is ongoing in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these delivery actions, my Department has just signed an agreement with the European Investment Bank for the provision of Cost Rental advisory services.  The EIB, which has extensive international experience of delivery, will provide technical assistance in examining market demand for Cost Rental housing.  It will also provide advice on optimal operating structures that are scalable and accessible to attract finance. Guidance will be provided as to other notable examples of successful European Cost Rental housing projects. <\/p>  <p>  Informed by, and in parallel with all of this work, my Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental for Ireland.  This requires consideration to be given to the many delivery options possible, and the challenges posed, in order to ensure that a coherent Cost Rental model can be delivered at a scale and in a manner that will have the desired positive impact on the Irish housing sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400085#WRHH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Approved Housing Bodies","counter":1317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400085#WRHH01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1318,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[20758\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400085#WRHH01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the actions he is taking to have tier 3 AHBs reclassified as off-balance sheet; the timeline for this reclassification; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1319,"content":"<p>My Department is continuing its work on the issue of reclassification, by Eurostat, of the majority of Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies as part of the Government sector for accounting purposes.

The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003.  The strategic context for the Arts Council&rsquo;s support of visual arts and all other art forms and areas of arts practice is set out in which is available on the Arts Council's website.  This 10 year strategy describes how the Council will lead the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade and has five priority areas: the artist; public engagement; investment strategy; spatial and demographic planning; and developing capacity.  This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers, by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy, and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.<\/p><p>In determining the award of funding, the Arts Council  includes as an assessment criterion, an organisation&rsquo;s policy on the remuneration of artists.  This helps to ensure that organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.  <\/p><p>The Arts Council Visual Arts Policy &amp;amp; Strategy sets out how the Council plans to support visual artists over the next three years.  This includes working with its funded organisations to develop principles and standards in relation to remuneration and working conditions as well as dealing with other challenges facing visual artists working in Ireland today.  In addition, the strategy sets out how the Council will develop public engagement, progress specific development areas that are strategic for visual arts.

This includes an increase to the Arts Council funding by almost &euro;6.8m or 10% to a total of &euro;75m made up of &euro;6m in current expenditure, which is more than double the increase in 2018.  The vast majority of this money goes directly to artists and those working in the arts in Ireland.<\/p><p>In 2017, the Government launched a pilot initiative allowing visual artists and writers to apply for jobseekers benefit if and when they became unemployed.

These are Killarney National Park and Wicklow Mountains National Park. <\/p>  <p>  There have been four significant fires within Killarney National Park since the 1st January 2018, three of which occurred in 2018 and one in 2019.  Their locations are as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  The 2018 fires occurred in Doogary, Gallavally and Gortracussane.  <\/p>  <p>  The latest fire occurred on Torc Mountain in late March 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  11 significant wildfires have been reported in the largest of our National Parks, Wicklow Mountains National Park since the 1st January 2018 &ndash; seven in 2018 and four in 2019.  The 2018 fires occurred in the following areas: Paddock Hill, Liffey Head, Lough Bray, Corrig Mountain\/Castlekelly and Carraigeenshinnagh.  In October 2018 there was a fire in  Laragh East and  in adjacent Drummin.  It should be noted that some of these fires, namely in Liffey Head and Lough Bray, burned for weeks and were fought multiple times by hand, by water tanker and by heli bambi-buckets,  although they are listed each as one fire.  To date in  2019 fires have occurred at Maulin, Seefingan, Sorrel Hill and Ballydonnel South.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the damage assessment of the recent fires in Killarney National Park, operational field staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), generally survey and undertake assessments of impacts after each fire.  The assessment procedures include mapping location\/extent of the area affected, habitats affected, significance of impacts, and on occasion detailed surveys of e.g. breeding birds.  Furthermore, NPWS is currently incorporating more detailed and systematic studies on the impacts of fires on the biodiversity of Killarney National Park into on-going scientific work there.  As far as damage assessment is concerned, in each case, local rangers and management are aware of the extent and severity of the fire, as well as the habitats affected and inform future decisions on firebreaks, public awareness, etc.  In respect of Wicklow Mountains National Park, the fires, whether in or out of the National Park are mapped as part of Site Inspection Reporting processes for SAC (special conservation area) and SPAs (special protection areas).  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that with regard to our National Parks, on an on-going basis, officials from my Department are in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Service.
