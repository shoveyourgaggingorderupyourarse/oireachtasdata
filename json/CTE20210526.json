While I welcome the scrutiny, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority already have.  That would send out the wrong message to the world, one of waning commitment to trade and free enterprise in Ireland which would have negative consequences for investment and employment.  Ireland should be a leader in Europe in support of free trade.<\/p> <p>  Unlike other countries, Ireland is not wealthy in natural resources.  We did not grow wealthy on the back of colonies.  Nobody owes us a basic income.  As a country, we owe our relative prosperity to the goods and services produced by our people and our land which we sell around the world.  It is a formula that has worked very well.  It is based on international trade, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter international free trade agreements with other countries.  Our position at the heart of Europe, its Single Market and the eurozone is also crucial to this.<\/p> <p>  This economic model has consistently raised our living standards throughout the decades and created hundreds of thousands of jobs for our citizens.  We will depend on that for the recovery.  It is the model that can best serve Ireland, the EU and the world as a whole, lifting billions out of extreme poverty in our lifetime.  This is the message I conveyed last week to EU trade ministers as we finalise Europe&rsquo;s trade policy review.<\/p> <p>  However, Ireland cannot take this for granted.  Following the departure of the UK from the European Union, Ireland has an even bigger responsibility to promote the EU&rsquo;s role as a champion for global free trade and to resist any backward moves towards nationalism or protectionism.  Nor can we take for granted the range of free trade agreements we benefit from every day - trade agreements that are negotiated on our behalf by the European Union, as a bloc of 27 countries and 440 million citizens.<\/p> <p>  Since the provisional application of CETA in 2017, the benefits have been plain to see.  Goods exports to Canada increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 78%.  Services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44%.  This all benefits Irish jobs, Irish businesses and Irish tax revenues, which we use to fund our public services and public infrastructure.<\/p><p>The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures and the more compatible technical requirements that flow from CETA make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to trade with Canada.<br\/><br\/>My Department recently released the results of an independent study by Copenhagen Economics of the potential economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland of the EU's free trade agreements, FTAs, with Canada, South Korea, Mexico and Japan.  It found that these four European Union FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income for Ireland.  It goes without saying that the deal with Japan benefits us the most, but that is due to the size of that country and its economy, which is approximately 120 million relative to Canada's 20 million.  An important finding is that real wages would increase by up to 4.4% by 2030 as a result of the trade agreements, with the largest increases for low-income workers.  This refutes the notion that well-designed free trade agreements exert downward pressure on wages or labour standards when in fact the reverse is true.<br\/><br\/>As members are aware, the full coming into force of CETA, once ratified across all member states, will see the implementation of the investment chapter of the agreement, including provisions for the resolution of disputes between investors and states should they arise.  This has been the area of most controversy.  All international agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  They have to.  Where such agreements cover not only trade in both goods and services but also investment rules and protections, then there must be some form of dispute resolution mechanism that covers the investments.  The EU's new approach to investment protection is the investment court system, ICS, which is contained in CETA and replaces the old investor-state dispute settlement or ISDS mechanism.  It is something that we, as Europe, looked for.  It was not imposed on us by Canada or anyone else.  It is there as much to protect our companies and their workers and to ensure that they are treated fairly and not discriminated against if they trade with China and other countries.<br\/><br\/>The rights of governments to regulate in the public interest is paramount and I believe this is fully protected under the terms of this agreement and the joint interpretative instrument.  Investors may utilise national courts or the ICS but cannot use both or forum shop.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can already sue the Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts whether CETA exists or not.  In the courts today we see plenty of examples of companies suing the Government and its agencies or the Government and its agencies suing companies.  The same will apply to Irish companies that operate in Canada, so it very much works both ways.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative to using national courts.  However, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the courts, cannot find any act by Government to <i>be ultra vires<\/i>or unconstitutional - it is concerned only with redress if harm is proven.  As the ICS tribunal cannot interpret national law or seek to overturn it, there is no question of it overriding national courts or legislatures.  Significantly, CETA introduces a precise and specific standard of &quot;fair and equitable treatment&quot; of investors and investments.  Therefore, an investor may only have recourse to the investment court system on very specific limited grounds such as in the case of the denial of justice, a fundamental breach of due process, or through targeted discrimination for example on the grounds of race religious belief or gender.  None of these rights gives the Government any concern that Ireland would be subject to ICS proceedings.  We are not going to discriminate against Canadian companies or treat them unfairly, so we do not anticipate many serious legal challenges.  Moreover, it is important to say that under the ICS a state can never be forced to change its legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly under the specific grounds detailed.  It is important to make clear that an investor cannot be given compensation just because they have lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs.  It is for the investor to prove they were discriminated against and to establish that it incurred losses as a consequence of the discrimination.<br\/><br\/>CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada's right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning policies such as those relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, or minimum alcohol pricing can continue to be introduced.  These &quot;right to regulate&quot; provisions are specifically designed to avoid any danger of so-called &quot;regulatory chill&quot;.  Despite having more trade agreements than ever, we have more regulations than ever and it is pretty obvious that one does not prevent the other.<br\/><br\/>As part of the finalisation of the agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding joint interpretative instrument, JII, that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety nor does CETA affect the Government's scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  Importantly, within CETA, both sides agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  The EU and Canada will not seek competitive advantage through the lowering of standards in any domain.  On the contrary, the European Union and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps confirm that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection should go hand in hand as far as is practicable.<br\/><br\/>As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefited immensely from our export-orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we support international trade and the EU free trade agreements that seek to underpin this.  Equally, Ireland has been an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, FDI, for many decades and participating in EU third country agreements that cover investment and provide investment protection continue to assist us in marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to invest with the attendant jobs and prosperity that entails.<br\/><br\/>As somebody who hopes in the coming months to travel to North America and around the world again to promote Ireland as a place to invest, ratifying CETA is an advantage in that regard.  Not doing so may cause some potential investors to have concerns.  Taking the foregoing into consideration and given that there can be no doubt that CETA is a progressive, high-standard agreement, I believe that ratifying the agreement, albeit at this late stage, would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.  I again thank the committee for taking the time to consider the agreement in detail.  I hope this process can help us to move towards ratification very soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#A00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming before the committee.  This all comes down to the investment court system that he dealt with substantially.  We had a number of legal minds and other experts before the committee.  There was some element in the narrative of people moving away from ISDS.  Regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, some of the ISDS-related situations were being negotiated out and the Canada-US-Mexico agreement does not have the same element of that at this point.  The French are looking at moving away from the energy charter treaty on the basis of the ISDS provisions within it and the Dutch are being sued currently.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the fear of being sued on the basis of the legitimate expectation of profits.  To a degree, I and others have asked why we would hamper ourselves in this regard and leave ourselves open to a chilling effect.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste stated earlier that Canadian companies currently have the right to go to court in the case of agreements.  I contend that we are not a rogue state in terms of our legal system and therefore companies have the option of European or Irish courts.  A number of speakers, including members, asked why we would rush into this given the difficulties.  A number of major players in Europe are making no moves towards signing up to the ICS.<\/p><p>I am thinking of France and the Netherlands.  Why would we sign up to this when elements of the provisions contained within the trade deal are in operation at this point?  We are talking about signing up to the ICS, while many trade deals are now being done without that.  That does not stop the EU, the UN or whoever coming up with some sort of ICS or dispute resolution mechanism that exists outside of trade deals and could be useful in facilitating business and such.  In this case, the fear is the chilling effect and that we will be slower to take action on climate change and all the rest of it.  The big example is the fears that have arisen regarding the Energy Charter Treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#B00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Fundamentally, there are a few things we need to accept.  If one has an investment treaty, one must have some form of dispute resolution system.  An investor court system is as good as any and better than an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS.  This will not be renegotiated.  It has been ratified by most member states.  I would not like Ireland to be the country that holds this up.<\/p><p>It features in other trade deals.  There are dispute resolution mechanisms in approximately 2,000 investment treaties.  It is in the EU-Mexico deal.  If we hold up CETA because of this issue, we will have to hold up the Mexico agreement too.  That would be a big mistake and would damage relationships with Mediterranean countries and Latin American countries, in particular.  While Canada might resile from aspects of this in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, it is signing up to it in the Pacific agreement.  It is not going out of fashion.  It may in time be replaced by some sort of world trade court, which I would not object to, but I imagine people will make the same arguments against that as they are making against this system.  <\/p><p>Governments can always be sued and often the cases I hear people citing in their opposition to CETA have nothing to do with CETA.  They are taken under other treaties or national laws.  Governments can be and are sued by companies.  It does not mean the companies win the cases.  <i>Vice versa<\/i>, governments sue companies.  That can be seen in our courts today.  On the fear of being sued having a chilling effect, I do not get that argument.  One may as well prevent access to the courts or to justice because companies can sue states and states can sue companies.<\/p><p>It is important to say it works both ways.  This is there to protect our companies and their workers if they end up in difficulty in Canada.  This is something the EU wants and looked for.  It was not imposed on us by Canada.  We would like this in agreements with other countries, particularly where we have concerns about their court systems.  We do not have concerns about the Canadian court system but there are countries around the world where we might be concerned about their court systems and would like to have an alternative mechanism such as this.  This is something the EU wants rather than something being imposed on us.  We want it to protect our companies, their workers and their owners.  <\/p><p>The real advantage for an Irish company investing in Canada is that rather than having to navigate their system which involves many provinces, municipalities and national courts, there is a single mechanism.  That is an arbitration panel comprising one Canadian, one European and one independent.  The same is true for Canadian companies.  Instead of having to navigate 27 countries with different constitutions and legal systems, they can have one system.  That promotes investment.  It is easier to invest in Europe if there is one mechanism that can be used rather than having to navigate up to 27 different ones.<\/p><p>I heard what was said in terms of the rush.  There is no rush whatsoever.  The agreement has been around for approximately ten years.  It might have been the Fine Gael-Labour Government that signed off on it.  Maybe it was not that long ago.  We have had another Government and two elections since then.  This is not being rushed in the slightest.  It is happening really slowly.  Of the 27 states in the EU, 15 have ratified this.  We are a slow adopter, which is not where Ireland should be.  We should be early adopters of trade agreements, not slow ratifiers.  Whether it is a UN convention or an international treaty, we should ratify agreements we sign up to quickly.  I would have made the same argument about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Istanbul Convention and was keen to get them done during my period as Taoiseach.  I am keen to get this done during my period in this office.  <\/p><p>France was mentioned.  The Assembl&eacute;e Nationale in France has ratified this.  We are behind them.  It has not been ratified by the senate in France but it has been ratified by their lower house.  It has also been ratified by the Bundestag in Germany but the vote has been challenged in the courts.  So we are even behind countries such as France, which are not seen to be advocates of free trade.  We are way behind on this.  Far from a rush, we are laggards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#C00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a couple of points the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made, elements of which the T&aacute;naiste referred to in his opening remarks.

More generally on Irish and EU trade strategies, how important is it that we, as an open, dynamic trading country, seize the opportunity with new trade deals?  Returning to Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s point, how do we look to the rest of the world?  For example, Australia and New Zealand are in their ninth round of negotiations with the EU or Vietnam and Malaysia which are starting off their negotiation with the EU on trade treaties.  How do we reassure those future trade partners if, all of a sudden, Ireland, of all member states arguably the most reliant on open international trade and investment, is trying to throw a spanner in the works after more than a decade of discussions about CETA?

It was the first time we met in person since Berlin last year and my first time in Brussels since February 2020.  It used to be kind of a second home.  It was strange to be there again but great to meet up in person.  Hopefully, that will be the norm again from now on.  We had a very long meeting.  It went on all day.  CETA did not come up, or, if it did, somebody might have mentioned it in passing.<\/p><p>This is not a hot topic of debate among EU trade ministers because the expectation is that it will be ratified by every member state sooner or later.  There is certainly no discussion of it being renegotiated.  That is not something I have seen any government seriously propose.  Individual politicians or parliamentarians might do so, but not a single one of the 27 member governments has said that.  It is quite different from Mercosur where a number of governments, including our own, are saying it needs to be renegotiated to include legally binding and enforceable protections around the environment, afforestation etc.  This is not in that space.  Not one of the 27 governments is suggesting an annex, renegotiation or protocol or anything like that.  Largely, Europe is moving on.  The focus of our discussions was China.  It was the US-EU trade agenda, trying to get things back on track given the change in administration with the Biden Harris Administration being much more multilateral and open to free trade agreements than the Trump Administration and also WTO reform now the new Director General is in place, and making that work better.  That was the focus of the agenda.<\/p><p> The potential for Ireland is considerable, particularly being an English speaking country with a similar culture and business culture to Canada, Ireland will be one of the countries that can benefit the most from increased trade with Canada.  The estimate you see from Copenhagen Economics might sound small, 0.2% of GDP, but that is &euro;600 million a year, of which about a third gets to the Government in taxation.  It could be worth &euro;200 million a year to Revenue, which is 20% of the mental health budget, to put it in context.  When you turn 0.2% of GDP into a cash figure and work out how much of that would come to us in tax, it is actually a considerable amount, and &euro;200 million a year for the Irish State to use on public goods is worth fighting for, to my mind.  <\/p><p> Yesterday, the Minster of State, Deputy Troy, launched the first of our free trade round table series which focused on raising the profile of the recent free trade agreements.  An online webinar was held in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland which focused on the Canadian market and the benefits arising from CETA for those companies.  Some 80 companies joined the webinar, mainly from the ICT area, digital, tech, engineering and consumer products.  They are the companies expressing an interest in trading more with Canada.  We were trying to help them to do business in the region, make them aware of CETA and its tariff-free benefits and also procurement opportunities.  One of CETA's big benefits is that it has opened up public procurement in Canada to Irish companies.  It is a campaign we will run through May and June, really focusing on the agreements with Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea.  There will be a further cycle later in the year looking at other regions that represent further opportunities for Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#C00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>As a member of the Government which ratified CETA originally, I was strongly of the view that CETA was in Ireland's interest and worthy of ratification.  Since most of the treaty has already been implemented, the obvious benefits for Ireland as a very open trading-focused economy is already self evident.  We live or die by trade.  We trade more <i>per capita <\/i>than virtually any country in the world and we support free trade.  However, the investment courts system has been focused upon.  I have not only listened to every piece of evidence presented but I have also done my own research as has every member of this committee.  There are undoubtedly real and substantial issues that we as a Parliament must address.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste, in his presentation, says that dealing with countries like China, we must have a robust dispute resolution system.  Of course we do.  Every international agreement has to have a dispute resolution system that both parties agree to, but in a trade deal with Canada and the EU there cannot be any doubt that the domestic court systems, the things that the T&aacute;naiste has mentioned occur every day, are both fair, robust and ones that everybody who is party to the agreement can have full confidence in.  Nobody has said for a second that any Irish investor could not have full confidence in a determination made by a Canadian court.  No Canadian who presented evidence to us has said they could not have full and complete confidence in a decision of an Irish court.  The whole mechanism has often been presented as a tool to encourage investors in developing countries where confidence in their court system is lacking but none of that applies in this particular agreement.  There may well be situations were we do agreements where there is an arguable case for an external oversight mechanism for disputes outside the domestic dispute resolution systems that are robust, tried, tested and in accordance with our constitutions but I do not see it in the context of this agreement.  That is the point on which I have the greatest difficulty.  <\/p><p>The committee has had presentations from professors in Ireland and from the University of Amsterdam, for example, citing the individual issue that the T&aacute;naiste has already been alerted to.  Among them is that once this is agreed, there will be a lack of oversight available to our Parliament for any rogue decisions made subsequently.  We have no legislative control over it once it is done.  Therefore the net question is whether we can have CETA without the investment court system, ICS?  The T&aacute;naiste's answer to Deputy Richmond was &quot;No&quot;, that it is an integrated package.  My experience, and I chaired three European Councils, is that where there is a very serious difficulty to be overcome, the flexibility within the EU institutions is extraordinary.  I have sat at Council meetings where intractable positions were resolved by clever legal operations.  I have no doubt that these things can be resolved if there is determination for it.  <\/p><p>It boils down to my last point that we do not want to go there because of the reputational damage it might do.  That is a fair point to make but if there is a component part of an agreement that causes us real concern then we have to set it out and see if we can have the agreement without the ICS.  I see no difficulty in arguing that case from an Irish perspective.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#D00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Howlin on a few points.  We have no concerns about the domestic court system in Canada and I do not think that Canada has any concerns about the domestic court system in Ireland.  I am not sure if that is necessarily the case for every EU country.  There are some EU countries which unfortunately do not uphold the kind of legal standards of independence of the courts as we do, and we need to bear that in mind.  ICS will work as an arbitration tribunal.  One person from Canada, one from the EU and one independent.  Before going down this line, a company has to decide if it is going to use the court system or whether it will use the investor court system.  They must consult with the Government, mediate and then arbitration occurs.  The advantage is that it will be easier for Irish companies in Canada.  They might not choose to use the mechanism but if they run into difficulties, in the unlikely event they are being discriminated against or treated unfairly by Canada or a government agency of Canada, they can opt for this system rather than having to navigate different provincial courts, for example.  Similarly, for a Canadian company investing in the EU, having this one simple mechanism that they can understand and take part in as an alternative to particular domestic courts, all with different systems and constitutions.  It is an advantage in terms of investment and will help to promote investment.  Companies will be more likely to invest in the EU and EU companies more likely to invest in Canada if we have this mechanism than if we do not.  However, we need to be very clear about what it can and cannot do.  Unlike the courts, it cannot overturn or strike down domestic legislation, it cannot decide that anything is <i>ultra vires<\/i>or unconstitutional.  There is no concern about that with this mechanism.<\/p><p> The Deputy stated that sometimes in European politics, if a country is a particular concern or if there is a bottleneck, we get together politically and use our ingenuity to resolve matters.  When Ireland initially rejected the Nice and Lisbon treaties, we saw how we could sit around a table and, without changing the treaties much, give reassurances to people that helped the treaties be ratified.  I take the Deputy's point in that regard.  It is only true to a point, however, and I think we have reached that point because that has been done.  The ISDS was changed to an investor court system.  We had the hearing of the European Court of Justice, which determined this was consistent with EU values, EU law and EU principles, and there was the joint interpretative instrument, so I think we have already been through that process.  Steps can be taken to reassure people and to allay fears, but there is a point at which we can go beyond that.  I think we have already reached that point.<\/p><p> As for what would happen if a member state definitively rejected CETA, I am advised that in order to formally communicate the completion of their national procedures, member states are required to officially notify the General Secretariat of the Council.  Were a member state to lose a vote on ratifying the terms of CETA, it might choose to engage in a period of discussion regarding the possibility of charting a path forward towards a positive endorsement of the agreement.  If a member state were unable to ratify CETA and this represented a permanent and definitive position, it would be obliged to formally notify this to the General Secretariat of the Council prior to any action being required on the part of the Commission.  If that were to happen, it would be the first time for any EU trade agreement - I would not like Ireland to be the country to do that - and the Commission would engage with member states regarding the implications.  The possibility of termination of the provisional application would arise and could be determined by qualified majority voting, QMV.  The idea, therefore, that we have banked the good bit of CETA and that is grand, and that we do not now need to ratify the second bit or try to get it changed, is not entirely true because there is the possibility of the provisional application being terminated, and that would do harm economically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#D00300","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his presentation.

We were happy to concede to that.  I would ideally like it to be put to a vote before the summer recess, and certainly no later than this year.  I do not want to go into too much detail on any court cases but I would find it very surprising if the courts found this agreement to be unconstitutional.  The ESM treaty was not, so I do not see how something that is less far reaching and does not involve a transfer of sovereignty could be unconstitutional.  People have a right to go to court, but I hope they will not impose on the taxpayer the cost of the court cases.   I think it would be wrong that the Government would have to pick up the bill for substantial legal fees if the case was defeated.  The decent thing for them to do would be to cover the cost of that themselves, or at least to contribute to the cost of it rather than asking the hard-pressed taxpayer to do it or for the money to be taken away from public services, which would be the effect, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  I do not recall being lobbied by any Canadian interests but the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, would certainly have met the Canadian ambassador and perhaps Canadian interests too.  By lobby, I mean to physically or virtually meet.  I get many letters all the time and I do not see them all, as the Deputy knows, so there may have been letters.  The Irish business associations have been very much in favour of the treaty and supportive of it, such as the various IBEC associations.  They are the ones dealing with Canada, and they know it is in their interest and is good for Irish business and Irish jobs.  They also know what signal it could send if Ireland starts to be seen as one of those countries in which the political consensus in favour of free trade is breaking down.  That would be a problem.<\/p> <p>  The chilling effect of that is the effect about which I worry.  One good thing we have had in Ireland for decades is that business and investors know that among the major parties, there is a political consensus in favour of the European Union, the Single European Act, the euro and so on.  It would be damaging for Ireland if people thought it was drifting away or that there was a move towards more extreme, nationalist ideologies that oppose the Union, the Single European Act and the euro, and that now might start opposing free trade agreements as well.  When businesses make investments, they make 30-year investments.  If they have a concern nationalistic politics of that sort could take hold in Ireland, they might invest elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#E00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

This has the potential to create a chilling effect whereby policymakers could be and will be hesitant to use the tax and regulatory system to try to change corporate behaviour.  This will create significant risks and could place limits on legislators acting in the public interest.  It will also mean that the State could incur significant fines or, even where cases are won, large legal fees.  I am interested in what the Government has done to examine the financial impact assessment of CETA.  Is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about the financial impact it may have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#E00500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>In regard to the argument on regulatory chill, it is clear in CETA that the Government continues to have the right to regulate.  That is specifically directed to allay concerns about regulatory chill.  Most investment claims do not challenge the Government's ability to legislate or regulate but are administrative in character.<\/p><p>A Government or State actor would be sued not because it has legislated or regulated, but because it has discriminated against a particular company or investor in the context of a particular licence or permit, or in cases of expropriation.  CETA does not restrict the EU or Canada from passing new laws in the public interest, such as in the areas of the environment or health and safety, nor does it affect our scope to develop new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  As I said, the chill effect about which I am concerned is not around our ability to regulate and legislate.  The number of free trade agreements is increasing year-on-year and so there is need for more regulations year-on-year.  Some people would say we have additional taxes every year notwithstanding that we have more trade agreements every year and more environmental rules.  As trade agreements have increased, so, too, have taxes, regulations and protections.  I do not see that as a chill.  The chill that I am concerned about is an economic one, that is, that Ireland, which has been always a reliable country and supportive of international trade, multilateralism, the EU and the WTO, might be moving away from that path.  There could be a fear among investors that the political consensus that we have had in Ireland, which has been always internationalist, pro-European, pro-free trade and pro-enterprise, might be waning and that nationalistic forces might becoming popular again in Ireland.  We saw the effect of that type of politics in the 1930s with the economic war.  It brought our population down to 2.5 million at one point, until it was reversed by Se&aacute;n Lemass and others.  <\/p><p> On the financial impact, we do not think there will be a financial impact.  If there is one, it will be minimal.  The Deputy mentioned that we could still face legal fees, but if one wins the case generally legal fees are covered, or most of them are covered.  There would only be a financial impact if the Irish Government or an Irish State actor was to discriminate against a Canadian company and that company was able to prove in court that it faced losses as a result of that decision and was then granted compensation as a result.  We think that is pretty remote.  It is impossible to assess on an econometric basis because there are so many variables and it is so unlikely to occur, but our assessment, applying logic, is that it would be zero or minimal because the Irish State and its agencies are not going to discriminate against Canadian companies and, therefore, they will not be able to prove that we have and, therefore, they will not receive any compensation for any losses.  <\/p><p> Deputy Howlin made the valid point that there is a strong case for having these mechanisms when it comes to countries not like Canada.  In other words, countries we are less confident about in terms of their legal systems and in their courts acting independently and fairly.  One of the reasons the EU wants this in CETA and in the Mexico Agreement is to set a precedent.  In negotiations, countries that are not democracies and do not have a courts system like ours, might ask why they should agree to this when it does not apply to other countries.  They might take the view that we would be saying we do not trust them and that is why we are demanding that this clause be in a treaty with them, yet we did not say that this should be in a treaty with countries like Canada and Mexico.  From a European point of view and from a strategic point of view, as team Europe, we want this included so that when we negotiate with Canada or, for example, countries in the Middle East, we can say this is standard clause that we now have in agreements with democratic partners like Canada and Mexico and we would like to see it in a particular agreement too.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#E00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#F00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#F00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>There will be time for supplementaries later.

At a previous meeting of this committee at which the Chair of the Ireland Canada Business Association was in attendance, I asked where I could find a list of the members represented by the association.

A company would have to go to the investor court tribunal and prove that the Irish State or one of its agencies had discriminated against it.  The grounds on which discrimination is defined are very clear in CETA.  They company would have to prove that it was discriminated against and that it incurred losses as a result and then be granted compensation from the Irish Government or one of its agencies as a result.  That is extremely remote.  I do not see the Irish State or Irish State agencies discriminating against Canadian companies and them being able to prove that before the three person tribunal.

It took Egypt to court because there was a clause in the contract providing that it would be compensated for any changes to social charges.  The company actually lost the case.  Anyone can take a case to court.  It does not mean the plaintiff will be successful.  I think the case referred to by the Deputy taken against Romania is the Gabriel Resources case.

The T&aacute;naiste is saying Ireland is a laggard and that he has no wish to go to North America unless Ireland has ratified it.  Yet, the French are content in the sense that they will not ratify this until after the French presidential elections.  That is on the basis of their experience with investor-state dispute settlement under the Energy Charter Treaty and Canadian companies.  The environment minister there was threatened with a billion euro legal suit by Vermilion, a Canadian oil company.  It forced the French ministry to change position.  If we are talking about being laggards, it is interesting that the French do not have the same concerns.

When people take cases that are unnecessary or unsuccessful, they should not burden the taxpayer or the Irish citizen with the full cost of them.  They should be willing to accept some of the costs themselves out of a point of decency, just as a person must when he or she makes a planning objection or when someone applies for a tender or contract and does not get it.  The tenderer has to bear the cost of a failed attempt.  There is a decency issue for people taking some of these cases.

We should seek to be among the early adopters and among the first to ratify the agreements.  That is the approach I took with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when getting it through as Taoiseach.  I feel the same about the Istanbul Convention and similar agreements.  We should not wait to be last or be in the second half of countries.  We should not say that simply because a country is slower than us, then it is fine.  We should aim to be among the countries first to ratify.  That is a matter of opinion.  Again, it speaks to my issue of Ireland being seen as a country that is committed to being pro-enterprise, multilateralist and interested in free trade rather than a country that waits until everyone else has done it to ratify.

One would have to imagine all cases of discrimination causing harm that could be successful that would get through the ICS but that would not have got through the national courts.  To me, it is minimal or zero.  To get compensation from the State, a company has to prove that it is being discriminated against and it has incurred losses as a result.  It then gets compensation and that is the cost to the State.  It also has to be proven that the company would not have achieved the same result had it gone through the national courts.

However, as there is more regulation, particularly in the area of the environment, more cases are taken by investors for compensation in respect of that investment.  Some 80% of investor claims have been taken in the past 15 years.  The number has increased year-on-year.  As we have more regulation, there is a relevant factor, so that where there is more regulation, we see more cases taken.  That has been acknowledged by the European Commission in respect of the energy charter.<\/p> <p>  I have been on the board of a very small company and we conduct a risk analysis.  Of course, it is about imagining scenarios.  Frankly, the idea that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not conducted a risk analysis is cause of concern for everyone.  Something that could be considered in that is a risk analysis on the legal cost.  Even the infamous Phillip Morris case, where Australia won, it paid a &euro;12 million legal fee.  We spoke of the decency principle but the fact is countries pay large costs even when they win.  Then there is risk analysis on areas of policy where we may have exposed ourselves.  One of the grounds for claims of unfair and inequitable treatment is under Article 10.2 of CETA where representations have been made to investors to induce investment leading them to have a legitimate expectation of operating in a particular area.  A very clear example might be REITs, which have been encouraged to invest in a certain way in property, as well as many others who have been encouraged and supported.  What is regarded as encouragement and inducement in case law under ISDS is often as simple as giving planning permission, giving a grant or a meeting with a representative body of the State.  These can be regarded as creating legitimate expectation and then creating a vulnerability when regulations in that area are changed to a claim for compensation.  We need to be really clear.  No one is talking about whether the State can regulate; that is not the question.  The question is: when the State regulates, is a potential liability added by this ICS for compensation in respect of companies that feel they have been unfairly or inequitably treated?  The T&aacute;naiste indicated that we do not need to worry because we will not discriminate.  Is he telling us that all policies in these areas where there are investors from Canada will be examined and that we will ensure that we form those policies in a way that will not leave us vulnerable to cases being taken?  Is that why he is confident we will not discriminate?  Is it because the Department has conducted a full review of our exposure to investors and such things we have done that may constitute inducement?  <\/p> <p>  It is correct that there are arbitration mechanisms in all trade deals but it is also the case that increasingly those arbitration mechanisms are solely between the parties, that is, the countries or blocs, not private investors.  In the UK-EU deal. there is arbitration between the UK and EU.  In the new deal between Canada, the US and Mexico, there is a very limited access for investors to arbitration mechanisms.  One reason for this is internationalism, because there is increasing realisation that Europe shares international goals with Canada regarding climate, sustainability and so on, and they could be undermined when an individual company that does not have to share those values decides to take a case in respect of its interests.  In that context, is the T&aacute;naiste concerned that there may be diplomatic or international damage if an Irish company were, for example, to sue Canada for taking an action that damaged the company's interests and that the company might have thought was unfair, but that was in line with our collective international goals in areas such as climate?  <\/p> <p>  I am asking explicitly around discrimination and what mechanisms will be in place to anticipate and look at questions about whether there might be discrimination and the risk assessments that might be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#H00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>One of the Senator's points is very valid, which is more cases are being taken with respect to environmental and other regulations, not only by companies but also NGOs.

Again, it says in the agreement for certainty that the mere fact a party regulates, including through modification of its laws, in a manner that negatively affects an investment or interferes with an investor's expectations, including its expectations of profits, does not amount to a breach of an obligation under this section, so I think there are very clear protections and there is a very high bar for companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#J00900","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>We have a number of supplementary requests.

It has been of great assistance to the committee.  I want to deal with one issue I am still concerned we have not dealt with enough, which is the chilling effect many people have presented to us regarding regulation.  I looked again at the chapter on investment and regulation measures.  Certainly CETA does, as the T&aacute;naiste says, reaffirm the right of states to regulate for legitimate policy objectives such as public health, environment, safety and so on.  It goes on to say it can take account of an investor's profit expectations arising from its interactions with the state or statutory bodies.<\/p> <p>  I want to be careful in what I say about this.  With regard to our public-private partnership programme, a particular company frequently resorted to the courts.  In my judgement, our experience with this company had a real and demonstrable impact on other companies tendering for business.<\/p><p>I am referring to the circumstances that would arise if there were in the public system a notion that certain things could not be done because it would mean ending up in court.

It is always the case that states and companies can end up in court.  I believe I know the example the Deputy is thinking about.  That has nothing to do with any international treaties but it is always the case that companies and states can end up facing each other in court.  Of course, that could have a chilling effect, deter investment or deter people from tendering.  It is a question of whether the inclusion of this additional mechanism, an investment court system, makes it better or worse.  I believe it makes it better because there is a clear system that companies can use.  It involves a panel of three people: one for Canada, one for the UK and one independent.  It is an alternative mechanism and is very difficult from what could be a much more complicated and difficult process, namely the process of trying to get through different courts in different legal systems, whether it is across Canadian provinces or EU states.  The risk exists.  It is a matter of whether the existing mechanism, this arbitration and mediation option, makes it better or worse.  I believe it alleviates the problem and makes things better.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the process for CETA and the argument that it is somehow being rushed, it was in negotiation for eight years and was agreed in 2016 with the joint interpretive instrument.  It was approved by the European Parliament and the 15 member states in 2017.  This was sorted out already.  One gets one shot at allaying concerns, as was done after the ratification of the Nice and Lisbon treaties.  We have already been beyond that process with CETA.  That was done through the joint interpretive instrument and the ECJ ruling.  I do not believe we can go back again.  It would be like rejecting Lisbon twice, or at least twice.

The T&aacute;naiste gave the example of Egypt and stated the case was won in the end.  The problem was that the workers did not get a pay rise for several years while the court case was ongoing.  The same applies to New Zealand.  As a former doctor, the T&aacute;naiste will appreciate that New Zealand and Australia withheld the introduction of plain packaging while the court case went ahead.<\/p> <p>  Let me give an example of regulatory chill at home.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste can rule this out for us.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to ban the importation of liquified natural gas, LNG, at Shannon.  It was previously on a list of projects of common interest, PCIs, of the European Commission.  The Government removed its support for the initiative from the PCI list but it remains on the PCI list until September.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications released a policy statement on a ban on the importation of fracked gas last week.  He said the Attorney General said it would not be compatible with EU law for the State to ban LNG importation.  The Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway has a legal opinion that clearly contradicts that.  Information I have from the European Parliament's research service states Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union indicates that member states choose the conditions for exploiting their energy resources and which energy sources they use so they can, therefore, ban particular fossil fuels and structures if they so decide to.   Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm categorically that the Energy Charter Treaty was not part of the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion concerning why we are now going ahead with what was in the programme for Government, which was a ban on LNG importation?<\/p> <p>  Under the Energy Charter Treaty, in respect of which the T&aacute;naiste keeps referring to fair and equitable treatment, 62% of the investor cases have been taken based on fair and equitable treatment.  Is it not true that the chance of winning a case is far greater if the case is taken through the investor court system as opposed to the national courts system and that this is why investors choose it?   We are going to set ourselves up for greater losses because the odds are against us.  One of the international legal experts said it is the equivalent of playing at home rather than away.  When one signs up to an investor court system, one is signing up to playing away constantly because investors will choose that system.  I would particularly like the T&aacute;naiste to confirm categorically that the Energy Charter Treaty was not part of the thinking in the advice that the Attorney General gave the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications on why we could not ban LNG importation.<\/p><p>Is it the case that we cannot ban it, which contradicts the advice I have from the EU, or is it that we stand at risk of being sued for compensation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#K00900","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I do not know.

There were two ECJ rulings.  One told us that states had responsibility, explicitly, for considering the investor court component and that this could not be decided at European level because of its implications for states.  That is one ECJ ruling we are trying to fulfil through the process of scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Paragraph 221 of the more recent ECJ ruling explicitly states that the dispute settlement mechanism should be reviewed prior to member states having to consider this in the ratification process.  It explicitly pointed out that the investor court system is not finished.  One of the concerns of the ECJ is that there is inequitable access and small and medium businesses do not have the same access to the investor court system as larger companies.  It found the measures and suggestions the Commission made in that respect, about a one-judge court and so forth, inadequate.  It explicitly asked that the mechanism be reviewed, allowing sufficient time for member states to consider that in the ratification process.  As far as we know, it has not been reviewed.  Is that not something of which member states should be aware?<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Howlin that things may need to be negotiated.  Whether or not they are negotiated to remove ICS, which I would prefer, it can certainly be adapted.  One area which could be adapted is the 20-year sunset clause.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on that clause, which has been identified by the European Commission as a major concern in the context of the Energy Charter Treaty?   Does the T&aacute;naiste not think that we should look for a shorter sunset clause so if we have adverse consequences from an investor court system under CETA, we have the option of exiting?<\/p> <p>  A one-word response will do in respect of my final question regarding internationalist goals.

On climate goals, there is always a potential conflict between trade and climate.  Trade, by its nature, means transporting things across seas and oceans.  That can increase emissions but one has to look at these things in the round.  There could be major advantages in terms of achieving our climate goals from increased trade and investment from Canada, particularly given their knowledge in the energy industry.  I do not mean gas, but renewables and so on.  There are potential benefits there.<\/p> <p>  The 20-year exit clause will only apply in the unlikely event of either party terminating the agreement.  The purpose of the investment court system is to protect small and big businesses, individuals and pension funds from discriminatory and unfair treatment by the state.  It is built around the core principles found in most domestic courts and international tribunals, such as permanency, the possibility of an appeal and the random allocation of cases.  Were a party to deny an investor due process by simply terminating the agreement, this could result in significant adverse effects for the investor and would be against the principles of natural justice.  Given that one of the main goals of CETA is to encourage further investment between the EU and Canada, which will facilitate jobs and improve prosperity for both parties, the agreement ensures only investment made under the terms of CETA is protected for a period of 20 years in the unlikely event that the agreement is terminated.  It once again seeks to encourage and protect investment, which I believe is a good thing.  It is important to note that only investments made prior to the agreement being terminated would be covered.  The ICS provisions under CETA would not be available to new investors during a phase-out period.<\/p> <p>  On CETA being revised to permanently exclude ICS from the agreement, all international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements of some sort.  Recent witnesses before the committee appear to have indicated there is very little appetite for reopening the agreement, from either the EU or Canada.  I can attest to that.  There is a fear that would lead to a Pandora&rsquo;s box situation regarding adjustments to the current text of the agreement.  Once the agreement is reopened, all the agreement is reopened.  I can attest to that when it comes to other negotiations I have been involved in.  Having negotiated a text that has been agreed and ratified by most European states over almost a ten-year period, there is no appetite to reopen it.  If we sought to exclude the dispute resolution mechanism, it is not clear what value the protections set out in the agreement would be worth if one cannot vindicate one&rsquo;s rights.  The protections are intended to encourage investors in terms of the security of their investments.<\/p><p>We need to remember that the provisions of CETA are not judicable in our domestic courts because CETA is not part of our national law.  In the absence of ICS, a Canadian investor would be required to progress a case under the respective national law and constitutions of 27 member states.  If we are confirming protections in CETA, we need a way that they can be vindicated.  I believe using arbitration and in a single consistent framework across 27 member states is a practical option.<\/p><p> There is an attempt to make it less costly for SMEs to engage in dispute resolution than is currently the case.  CETA includes specific provisions on mediation which do not exist outside EU agreements.  These are of relevance to SMEs, as mediation represents a low-cost option compared with full litigation in the courts.  CETA encourages parties to a dispute to solve the issue amicably within 60 days, rather than go through litigation.  The possibility to have mediation is available at any time in the proceedings.<\/p><p> The provisions allowing parties to hold consultations via video conference, which is easy and of low cost, can be of particular benefit to SMEs.  Procedural deadlines also make proceedings faster and reduce the cost of litigation.  As I mentioned earlier, an SME has the option, on request, to submit claims to a single judge which would make proceedings faster and cheaper.  It seems that ICS might be a better option for SMEs rather than relying solely on national courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021052600002#L01700","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Ar&iacute;s, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don T&aacute;naiste ar son an choiste agus d&aacute; oifigigh as ucht a theacht go dt&iacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht inniu.

Engineers, and I am talking about qualified professional chartered engineers, are critical to the construction sector.  However, all engineers involved in the sector - structural, civil and fire safety engineers - face a problem securing professional indemnity, PI, insurance.  While I will focus today on the fire safety specialists where problems can result in catastrophe, unfortunately the problem is wider.  We are not here to allocate blame but to help to find a solution.  Without a solution, today's housing and other construction infrastructure projects will just get worse for everybody.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to give evidence on the serious concerns and difficulties faced by engineering professionals in obtaining PI insurance in 2021.  I am the vice president of Engineers Ireland and a chartered engineer.  At 186 years old, Engineers Ireland is one of the oldest and largest representative bodies on the island of Ireland, with over 25,000 members.  This membership, comprising third-level engineering graduates, incorporates all disciplines of the engineering profession in Ireland in consulting and contracting organisations, the public sector, semi-State bodies and educational institutes.  Our members are organised into regional branches, engineering divisions and societies, including our fire and safety division.<\/p> <p>  A professional engineer offering a professional advisory certificate or opinion is required to hold PI insurance.  The PI insurance issue is quite broad for engineering professionals and affects fire safety sign-off, procurement and structural sign-off.  It is intended to protect professionals and their businesses in the event of a claim arising from a loss as a result of non-performance or negligence in the services provided.  In addition, the policy can cover legal and other costs and expenses incurred in the defence of any claim, which can, in many cases, be a substantial portion of the overall costs in processing a claim.  PI cover is also required for any work to existing buildings, including refurbishment, extensions and change of use.  <\/p> <p>  An important difference between PI insurance and other insurance policies is that PI insurance is written on what is called a \"claims made\" basis.  It is the policy in force at the time that the claim is made that deals with the claim rather than the policy in force at the time when the work was done.  An example would be where a practice was asked to complete a project in 2016 but the client did not make a claim until 2021.  As a result, it is the policy in force in 2021 that deals with the claim rather than the cover in place in 2016.  Therefore, PI insurance is generally required to be kept in place for a number of years after the project's completion.  That is an issue in itself.  I will now hand over to Mr. Michael Lyons, chairperson of the Engineers Ireland fire and safety division and a chartered engineer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Our members work in both the public and private sectors.  The PI insurance issue affects those in the private sector immediately but the crisis will have adverse implications for the public sector, particularly when it comes to delivering housing completions.  Those engineers having PI insurance would include sole traders and fire safety engineering practices with three to four engineers, up to practices with over 20 to 30 employees.  Generally, engineering practices would typically carry out fire safety design, inspections and certification of fire-resisting construction, fire safety systems, electrical and mechanical systems for fire detection, emergency lighting, smoke control and active fire suppression.  Activities requiring inspection and certification include the construction of fire-resisting floors and external walls in houses and smoke detection systems in houses as well as specifying proper materials on cladding systems, wall and ceiling linings.  All such design and construction is required to comply with Ireland's building regulations for fire safety.  It should be noted by the committee that 12 years of PI insurance cover is the norm when a collateral warranty is in place.  This requires that a practice be able to renew its PI insurance cover for each of the succeeding 12 years.<\/p> <p>  In respect of PI insurance in 2021, insurance underwriters, which are mostly UK-based, have withdrawn from the Irish market.<\/p><p>The amount of capital to cover PI insurance claims has reduced, precipitating a prohibitive and exorbitant rise in premiums, excess and the imposition of more restrictive terms, including the exclusion of covering fire safety-related work.  The high levels of PI insurance required as part of procurement contracts and the multiple risks involved mean that cover is replicated and risk is pushed down the insurance supply chain.  As a result, many engineering practitioners are finding it increasingly difficult if not impossible to obtain cover at reasonable costs.  Some fire practitioners are being refused cover or are just not quoted.  Many are only being offered policies with fire safety being excluded from cover and policies are offering much lower limits on individual and aggregate claims.<\/p><p> If the current trend persists, after a year of restrictive renewal notices, there will be relatively few firms in a position to offer fire safety certification for design and construction.  This will impact on all of the construction industry, on the approval of designs, on the commencement of projects or on the handover of completed projects such as housing, flats, nursing homes and factories.<\/p><p> PI insurance premiums are priced on a number of factors including the practice&rsquo;s turnover and the values of projects that the firm is involved with.  The culture of below-cost tendering, inappropriate risk transfer and costing in tenders directly impacts on the estimated level of capital required in the PI insurance market.  The underwriting of the insurance industry in Ireland is Anglocentric.  There are impacts from Brexit but also from contagion due to developments in the UK market, for example, the liquidation of Carillion in 2018 and the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Engineers Ireland has been raising this issue along with our colleagues in the Construction Industry Council.  We welcome the attention that the committee is giving to PI insurance and we look forward to working with the committee, the Government and other stakeholders towards a solution or solutions.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Lyons","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Lyons or Mr. Power tell the committee what the premium cost is?

I know from discussions with different colleagues that when a project begins, a consulting engineer practice will have PI insurance.  During the course of the construction of the building, it will be inspected and materials will be approved.  At the end of the project, depending on the set-up, the assigned certifier may be relying on a fire safety consultant or on another engineer who is acting as the fire safety certifier.  In order for the fire safety certifier to issue an opinion of compliance and an ancillary certificate, there will need to be PI cover at the end of the project.  If during the course of the project they cannot renew their PI cover, they will not be able to issue the certificate that the rest of the team were relying upon.  Either there will be delays, replacements will have to be found or the development of the project will founder.<\/p> <p>  I have many colleagues who are in the middle of projects and are finding it difficult to get their policies renewed, or in getting the renewal of their policies they are finding that the terms are very heavy.  For instance, I have a colleague in Waterford who has been in practice for over 20 years.  In 2020, the firm had a PI policy for &euro;6.5 million insurance cover at a cost of &euro;10,000.  In 2021, it was offered just &euro;1 million cover and was quoted over &euro;40,000 with a significant number of exclusions attached to it.  I will explain the implications of that.  If a project the firm is involved in requires having &euro;6.5 million insurance cover, and mid-race it loses that &euro;6.5 million cover, it is no longer able to meet the terms of the contract it entered into at the very beginning of the project.  In the case of a housing estate worth &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million, the firm can no longer cover the fire safety risk that the policy was intended to cover because its level of cover has been reduced to &euro;1 million.  In addition, the exclusions that have been attached to the policy may mean that the engineering firm cannot certify the external walls or something like that.  It could have something to do with some aspect of the construction.  Current projects could be under threat.  Certainly, the ability of fire safety engineering firms to get involved in new projects is most definitely at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Have Mr. Lyons and his colleagues carried out an analysis on the various sites around the country to determine where this might happen?

One colleague, for instance, has a deadline of the middle of June and has no offer of renewal of PI insurance.  From the middle of June, this firm will have to cease providing inspection and certification cover for any particular project it is involved in.  I have a colleague who has a housing estate beginning in Wicklow in July with over 110 houses.  His general engineering and architectural practice has been told that fire safety will no longer be covered under its particular policy.  He has to inform the developer and the client that they need to engage a new engineer or architect to do all of that inspection and certification work, or they need to employ a specific specialised fire safety consultant on that type of housing project.  That would be very unusual because engineering and architectural practices are typically able to cover domestic fire safety issues, particularly on single-storey and two-storey housing, because the degree of fire safety work is limited and domestic.  If the firm's PI policies exclude it from having anything to do with fire safety work, it will have to buy in additional external fire safety specialisation, which obviously adds additional costs.

I will commence with questions to Engineers Ireland.  The committee has received correspondence from fire safety engineers who are concerned about the huge rise in the cost of PI insurance.  One particular company said that the cost of cover in 2019 was &euro;2,500, that it then rose to &euro;7,000 in 2020 and that in 2021, initially, it was unable to get a quote and when it did the annual premium quoted was &euro;65,000.  In a two-year period, the cost of cover increased from &euro;2,500 to &euro;65,000.  That is unmanageable for many companies.<\/p> <p>  We are all aware that this issue has come to a head as a result of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.  It needs to be recognised that the systems in Britain and Ireland are very different.  In the main, British underwriters are not differentiating between the Irish fire safety risk exposure and that in Britain.  We have a report which confirms that Ireland does not have the same fire safety risk exposure as Britain, but that does not seem to be recognised by these underwriters.  It is essential that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, engages with underwriters in Irish construction and with the engineering industry to understand these concerns, provides underwriters with the assurances that are needed and clarifies the differences between the systems in Britain and Ireland.  We are aware of 15 businesses that have withdrawn from the market as a result of this issue.  This impacts on businesses, but also on construction because this is a key component in regard to the construction of office buildings, etc.  Does Mr. Lyons agree that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, needs to engage on this matter and that the Government needs to take strong action in this regard?  This is a huge issue and it is putting companies out of business.  The cost of &euro;65,000 for 2021 is not possible for many businesses.

I can confirm it is not an outlier, unfortunately.  There are 1,240 affiliated members in the fire safety division of Engineers Ireland.  I would have regular contact with scores of different fire safety consultants and engineers.  Practically everyone is telling me that since the beginning of this year their policy renewals have trebled or quadrupled, the excesses have increased significantly and all of the conditions attached to the polices have excluded various things.<\/p><p>For instance, one of the fire safety consultant firms came back and informed me that when it applied for its renewal, the first offer of renewal excluded fire safety construction, fire safety systems and any fire safety aspect of external walls.  What that effectively meant was that the firm ceased being a fire safety consultant, which was its primary work.  It went back and its broker did a lot of negotiating on its behalf.  It ended up being offered a policy but the cost quadrupled from what it had been in 2020.  That firm was allowed to do fire safety work even though external walls were excluded from its future works.  The firm was happy with that because it was better that it was able to do the core part of its business, even though it was not going to be allowed to carry out its normal function on the fire safety aspects of external walls.  That is a simple example that has been repeated in Waterford, Cork, Galway, Louth, Donegal and Dublin.  The location makes no difference and the same story is being repeated throughout the country.  The bite has occurred this year in particular.<\/p><p> It is also happening with structural engineers who are finding some of the same difficulties.  In terms of fire safety work, practically everybody involved on a building site has a fire safety aspect of some type attached to their work.  That includes mechanical and electrical engineers who are doing ducting for air conditioning, fire dampers and the like.  There is always some aspect of their work that contains an element of fire safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#C01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Lyons","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lyons and have a couple of final questions on that matter.  I am looking for an understanding of what it will mean if this problem is not rectified.  Will costs be passed on to the customer?  What will it mean in terms of the prices of homes?  Have any calculations been done in that regard?  We are also talking about offices and hotels, etc., which all require this type of certification.  What concern would Mr. Lyons have for companies that are not able to deal with these increases?  Will they fold?  That is one of the concerns relayed to me by some of the companies.  They do not think that these levels can be dealt with on an ongoing basis.  That will result in unemployment and a bigger issue for any sector that depends on these certificates.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the level of underwriting that is taking place.  How many underwriters are we dealing with here?  Are they all British underwriters?  Is there a small number of them?  We have had similar issues in the childcare sector, for example, where we were down to one insurance company to underwrite the sector.  Other sectors, such as companies providing soft play areas and so on and so forth, have seen the appetite to underwrite withdraw from the market.  There have been other issues about which we will talk.<\/p> <p>  My final comment relates to something close to my heart.  Mr. Lyons talked about the north west.  We are currently dealing with a serious problem, and have been over the past number of years.  Homes are falling apart as a result of the mica scandal in Donegal, Mayo and Clare.  Some 6,000 homes have been affected, predominantly in Donegal.  One of the issues may concern Mr. Lyons' profession.  The scheme as currently drafted is flawed and we are hoping for a 100% redress scheme.  One of the problems with the scheme is that it is in the form of one home, one scheme, which means that the engineer must certify whether a home is affected by an outer block problem or an inner block problem, whether the house must be demolished and so on and so forth.  If it is an outer block problem, it is cheaper than both outer and inner, and cheaper than demolishing the house, but the problem is that if the engineer gets it wrong, it is he or she who will be sued.  As a result of that, the engineer needs insurance and indemnity.  It also forces engineers to be ultra cautious and go for the more expensive option.  Has Mr. Lyons had interaction about the scheme?  Is he concerned that we have a Government scheme that potentially leaves engineers liable in that scenario?  A number of claims in that area will cause insurance costs to spiral in terms of indemnity for engineers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#D00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I will come in there, if the Deputy does not mind.  Mr. Lyons will address the specifics of some of the Deputy's questions.  The Deputy mentioned passing some of the costs on to the customer.  Unfortunately, that will probably not be able to happen because the customer will probably not be able to pay.  In terms of sign-off on the project, it will not happen and the customer will not take delivery of their house, development or whatever at the end of the day.  I emphasise that the expertise is here.  We have plenty of engineers who have the expertise to sign off on this throughout the country.  However, if we cannot get to the bottom of this issue, the inevitability is that the construction sector will suffer significantly and there will be a significant number of job losses at a professional level.

One of the mechanisms that a professional team can use if it no longer has PI cover for fire safety is to pass the responsibility on to the builder and require the builder to employ a specialist contractor or fire safety consultant engineer, or whatever, to carry out the role.  The builder will, of course, pass the cost on to the client.  One way or another, if additional expenses are introduced to the construction phase, they will be passed on to the ultimate payer, the customer.<\/p> <p>  We have done some basic research on the numbers of underwriters.  Most of the information that is coming back to me is that the underwriters are based in the UK.  I understand there are one or two in Dublin but the vast majority involved in fire safety appear to come from the UK.<\/p> <p>  In terms of employment, if firms find that the running costs are too expensive, they will fold and close.  As I mentioned earlier, I am aware of one particular fire safety consultancy that has no offers for renewal of its PI insurance.  It has a date looming in mid-June and if its insurance is not renewed, it will close.  That will be a loss.

Turning to the market, and I should say that I am not enormously competent in this area, one must ultimately look at the risk versus reward element in this regard.  Many of the British operators have left the Irish market, obviously, because they were not receiving a return on their investment for some reason.  I am not stating where the fault lies for that, because it is not our job to blame people.  Our job is to recognise that there is an issue and that we must all get together around a table to sort it out for the good of the construction sector in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  However, an obvious reason for companies to leave would be the risk versus reward factor.  We are all aware of situations where some awards have been very significant.  Clearly, only a certain amount of money is available to balance awards against claims and that is the perspective from which the insurance companies are looking at this situation.  It may, therefore, be a matter of us looking at all the elements involved, namely, the premiums, the availability of those premiums, how the whole area is structured in respect of where the money goes and who gets the most out of it in the end.  We must ask ourselves which organisation will ultimately be left standing, because that entity will generally see a significant benefit in remaining involved in the market.

Several possible solutions and parameters will be required to address this difficulty concerning the underwriting of insurance policies for professional indemnity.  The Grenfell Tower fire in the UK triggered the awareness of the difficulty with external cladding on buildings.  Insurance and mortgage providers in the UK then introduced an external wall system, EWS, scheme and an EWS1 form, whereby the issue of external cladding was separated and removed from the normal process.  Chartered fire engineers now assess external cladding on buildings and subsequently fill out these EWS1 forms.  That was the solution arrived at in the UK to deal with the particular aspect of the difficulties that arose from the Grenfell Tower fire.  The EWS scheme was supported by the UK Government and a fee and cost was set in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There is probably not a major difficulty in Ireland in that area, because a review was done here following the Grenfell Tower fire by the then Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

It comes right in the middle of a housing crisis and at the same time as the pyrite and other issues mentioned by other members.  We are looking at situations where consumers must shoulder the burden and have become the victims in that regard, despite it now being 30 years since the creation of the national house building guarantee scheme, Home Bond.  I remember some 35 years ago having the roofs of all the houses in an estate replaced because of a structural defect.  Compare that with the pyrite situation we have now, where a limit was applied.  I cannot understand on what basis that was done, because there is either a guarantee or there is not.  In addition, it will be done subject to whatever evaluation must be done.  Many people have been severely impacted by the defects that have now emerged in their properties.  Several houses have had to be demolished and some of them have been gutted.  Ultimately, in most cases, the people involved must carry the full responsibility themselves.<\/p> <p>  After all these years of improvements to the systems we have put in place to protect the public, I find it very hard to accept that we have now arrived at a situation where we cannot get PI insurance cover for fire safety and it is being conducted from outside the country.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell raised the question of what other companies are underwriting in this area and what changes have occurred.  I am also conscious that we are in the European Union and the UK is not.  I do not know if that difference is affecting this situation.  If it is, however, we must do something about it urgently.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that I am deeply dismayed to hear the subject matter of this discussion.  It is a terrible blow to consumers.  Those buying houses are already badly enough beset by all the obstacles they face every day.  An urgent reappraisal is required in this area and it should be done with a view to ensuring, whatever else might fail, that our hard-pressed consumers are protected, and most especially in the area of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#E01200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#E01300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Clearly, the Deputy paints a bleak picture.

I remember suggesting one time at a meeting with all sectors that the insurance sector, the construction sector and the local authorities with a function in the area might come together as one with a view to addressing the issues.  For instance, if substandard materials are used in the construction of a building, there is a liability on someone.  It should not be on the customer.  There is a liability on somebody.

I wanted to start by welcoming the publication of the Action Plan on Insurance Reform and the adoption of the Judicial Council&rsquo;s personal injuries guidelines.  Both of these developments are significant steps in our collective endeavour to bring meaningful change to Ireland&rsquo;s high cost of claims.<\/p> <p>  The work of this committee has been invaluable in helping to bring about these and other reforms for the benefit of consumers and businesses.  I also wanted to acknowledge the profound impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our society and our economy.  It has been a huge challenge for us all.  Our customers and our colleagues have remained our priority throughout this extremely difficult period.  Before briefly addressing the specific topics, I hope it will be helpful to the committee if I provide an overview of AIG&rsquo;s business and its history in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  AIG has been in operation in Ireland for over 44 years, having entered the Irish market in 1977.  American International Group, Inc., AIG, is a leading global insurance organisation and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Today, building on over 100 years of experience, AIG member companies provide a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement products and other financial services to customers in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions.  These offerings include products and services that help businesses and individuals to protect their assets, manage their risks and provide for retirement security.<\/p> <p>  Our Irish business, which is run from our Dublin office in North Wall Quay, employs approximately 160 people in the general insurance division.  We have approximately 500,000 customers.  Since 1977, AIG has been the insurance partner for large and small companies, not-for-profit organisations and consumers in Ireland.  Our global footprint, combined with our local presence and knowledge, has enabled us to support the insurance needs of Irish-based companies expanding in the EU and throughout the world, as well as the insurance needs of US and other multinational businesses in Ireland.  Our principal products are financial lines, for example, directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; insurance, motor insurance, leisure and travel insurance, liability and property insurance.  Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, AIG has remained focused on continuing to serve policyholders, business partners and other stakeholders, as well as protecting the health and safety of our colleagues and partners.  Helping individuals, businesses and communities to prepare for times of uncertainty is at the heart of what we do.<\/p> <p>  AIG has introduced a range of measures to support its customers throughout Covid-19.  For motor insurance policyholders, these measures include priority repairs, free breakdown service and courtesy cars for HSE and front-line professionals.  We have also applied discounts for policy renewals where this is appropriate, reflecting, for example, lower driving volumes due to travel restrictions in place to contain the spread of the virus.  AIG&rsquo;s policies that include business interruption cover are typically property and commercial policies where the business interruption results from physical damage to property. This is the basis on which our property and commercial policies are priced.  Typical examples of covered physical perils include fire, explosion, material breakdown, machinery breakdown and natural catastrophe.  Our priority for all our business customers is to support their efforts to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity as society and the economy begin to reopen, by dealing with claims fairly and paying promptly where policies provide cover.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to the cost of insurance, AIG welcomes the publication of the Action Plan on Insurance Reform and the principal recommendations aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for the benefit of policyholders. The adoption of the personal injuries guidelines by the Judicial Council last month is an important step in this regard.  While each insurer is responsible for its own pricing, the industry has a track record of responding quickly to change, as is evidenced by the 40% decrease in insurance costs following the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, in 2004.  The guidelines will apply to cases that have not yet been assessed by PIAB.  We are hopeful that as the guidelines are implemented, award levels will begin to fall, leading to a reduction in overall claims costs.  The strengthening of the authority and powers of PIAB as set out in the action plan is also a positive step.<\/p><p> Finally, we welcome the Government's commitment to the review of the duty of care laws.  A more balanced approach to the duty of care applied to policyholders is central to achieving meaningful reform, which will in turn impact overall claims.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the reforms introduced to date have been the culmination of many years of work by the Government, the Oireachtas, insurers, consumers and other stakeholders.  We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the committee and the Government to deliver change and meaningful reform to the benefit of customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Connaughton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I am the CEO of AXA Ireland.  I thank the committee for the invitation to this meeting, in particular for its flexibility in facilitating the meeting today when I unavoidably had to decline the invitation to the meeting last week.  I am joined Ms Deirdre Fagan, who is a senior claims manager at AXA Ireland and Ms Antoinette McDonald, who is our customer and marketing director.<br\/><br\/>AXA Ireland is the largest general insurance company in the Irish market, with approximately &euro;900 million of premium income and over 1 million customers.  We operate across the island of Ireland and we employ over 1,400 people here.  We operate in all channels of the market and offer products direct to consumers and via intermediaries and partners.  Our direct channel is supported by an extensive branch network, including call centres and online capability.  We offer a wide range of insurance products, including motor insurance, home insurance, farm insurance and insurance for small businesses.  AXA Ireland is part of the AXA Group which is one of the world&rsquo;s leading insurance groups, with operations across the globe.<br\/><br\/>I took the opportunity to review the committee&rsquo;s meeting with a number of companies in the sector last week and, to my mind, there was a clear focus by the committee on two issues in particular.  The first was how individual insurers were responding to the decision of the Judicial Council to review its guidelines and whether the companies would reflect that decision in respect of motor premiums.  The second was how individual insurers were dealing with business interruption claims arising from the Covid-19 pandemic<b>.<\/b>I am sure we will get the opportunity to discuss these issues in more detail momentarily, but I will make a few comments on both.<br\/><br\/>I am constrained by competition guidelines in commenting on the specifics of pricing action.  However, on the issue of the Judicial Council decision and its impact on car premiums, I can confirm that AXA Ireland has already begun passing on premium reductions to customers as a direct result of the positive decision of the Judicial Council in March.  Indeed, the benefits of those rate reductions are evident in premiums written by AXA Ireland since March, and we have now begun writing individually to customers to formally confirm to them that their premiums will be lower as a direct result of the decision of the Judicial Council.  On business interruption insurance linked to the pandemic, AXA Ireland acted quickly, applying a fair, transparent and proactive approach.  Two core principles underpinned our actions: first, to honour all claims within the terms of existing policies; and second, to provide certainty and consistency to customers.  On that basis we wrote to customers and brokers shortly after the first lockdown commenced at the end of March last year and we confirmed cover under the AXA shop, office and surgery policy.  We made first claims payments in early June of last year.  To date, 94% of claims for our shops, offices and surgeries have been settled.<br\/><br\/>We have also received 459 separate claims under a different policy, which is called AXA enterprise commercial property policy and does not provide cover for business interruption from Covid-19.  Some of these customers understandably challenged this position and to progress the matter quickly, AXA Ireland funded a legal challenge, which will act as a test case under the Central Bank of Ireland business interruption supervisory framework.  That case was heard in January of this year.  In recent weeks, the High Court made its decision on this matter, and the court found in favour of AXA Ireland.  That decision may yet be appealed and if that is the case, we will support an early hearing on the matter in order to bring certainty to the companies that have made the claims.<br\/><br\/>Last week, some members of the committee asked whether, in business interruption claims, the insurer would deduct the value of State supports linked to the pandemic which were received by businesses.  From our perspective the answer to that is &quot;Yes&quot;, because that is the basis on which the policy was written and the risk insured.  One of the general principles of insurance is to place customers back in the same financial position before the loss, neither better nor worse off.  The AXA product is consistent with this guiding principle in that it was specifically designed to incorporate such deductions to reflect the mitigating actions that policyholders have made to reduce the scale of their financial losses.  AXA Ireland did not deduct any State supports which were intended to support a business in reopening or to help it to manage future cashflow, such as future rate waivers or reopening grants.  I recognise that others, including members of the committee, have a different view on this issue.  We will welcome discussion with the Minister to tease out this important and complex issue further.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I thank the committee for its commitment to supporting efforts to reduce the cost of insurance and to ensure a sustainable insurance sector at the heart of this economy.  AXA Ireland will continue to do all we can to support this work.  I thank members for their attention and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Bradley"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Bradley.

Across the board in insurance premiums throughout the world, across everybody's insurance regardless of what it is, insurance companies have to look forward and anticipate increasing costs and apply premiums based on that.

Fraud in all forms has to be stamped out.  AXA has a big part on its website about how fraud is increasing year on year, but the reality is that only 48 cases were referred to the Garda last year and only 63 cases the year before.  There has actually been a reduction in the number of cases that have been referred to the Garda for fraud.  If insurance companies are telling us they have 1,018, 1,048 or 3,794 letters inspected, why the hell are they not being referred to the Garda?  That is the point.  I am not asking the witnesses to respond but I am asking the insurance companies to tighten their ship in this regard and to stop claiming this is about fraud.<\/p> <p>  My final point is for AIG.  One of the big issues we have seen probably in the past ten years has been the reduction of investment income, which has hit the profitability of the insurance firms, which has in turn resulted in an increase in premiums.  We see now that AIG is investing heavily in the funding of apartments.  For example, it announced &euro;147 million in funding to Marlet, the construction company, for the construction of 596 apartments in the Grand Canal area, in Dublin 8.  Is this something that insurance companies will be more involved in from now on?  These apartments were funded by AIG without an end buyer, so there is no advance purchase agreement at the end.  Obviously, finance is important for the construction of apartments.  Is this a new trend that we will see more and more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021052600002#M00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I saw that note in the newspaper.

During the recession there were a number of issues with houses.  There were builders who had gone bust.  Under the Civil Liability Act, finding even a 1% element of liability means that the engineer or architect, as the case may be, ends up having the whole book thrown at them and the insurer has to stand behind that indemnity, which is exactly what the problem was before.

We are the national alliance for voluntary, patient-led organisations for people affected by or at risk of developing rare diseases.  Our vision at RDI is equitable access to diagnosis, treatment, health, social care and opportunity.  I thank all members very much for the opportunity to speak to them on the topic of improving the lives of those affected by rare diseases and their families.  I am joined by Dr. Sally Ann Lynch, consultant clinical geneticist at Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, and Ms Avril Daly, CEO of Retina International and vice president at EURORDIS - Rare Diseases Europe.  Ms Daly also has first-hand experience of living with a rare condition.<br\/><br\/>The challenges of living with a rare condition are acknowledged in the programme for Government, published in June 2020:<\/p> <blockquote> \t[M]any rare conditions are complex, and their impacts are severe on the patients living with them.  At times, it can be difficult to access appropriate medications and technology. <\/blockquote> <p>Today we are asking for the committee's support to press for delivery on the promises made to the rare disease community in the programme for Government, in particular those promises relating to genetics and genomics and an updated national rare diseases plan.  Almost one year on from its publication, there has been no progress on these promises.  As a priority, we must see allocation of resources at the Department of Health to bring leadership and accountability to these commitments.<br\/><br\/>Before proceeding any further, however, let me provide some background data on rare diseases in Ireland.  A rare disease is defined as a condition that affects less than one in every 2,000 people.  This is the definition used in Europe.  There are more than 6,000 individual rare diseases that we know of, with more being described daily.  It is estimated that 300,000 people are living with rare conditions in Ireland - 300,000 people, individually rare but collectively common.  This compares with 170,000 people living with or recovered from cancer.  A total of 300,000 people living with a rare condition amount to a little over 6% of the population.  More than one in every 20 people in Ireland is living with a rare condition, with 4% of children receiving a diagnosis of a rare condition by the time they reach 16 years of age.  Let us consider that of the 61,500 18-year-olds in their leaving certificate year this year, 2,500 have been diagnosed with a rare condition.  Paediatric rare conditions have an enormous impact with 58.6% of deaths in those under the age of 16 are due to an underlying rare condition.<br\/><br\/>Rare conditions are characterised by a wide diversity of symptoms and signs that vary not only from condition to condition but also from person to person with the same condition.  They are chronic, progressive, degenerative and often life-threatening.  While many people with rare conditions live with disabilities such as motor, sensory or intellectual impairments, others show no visible external signs that they are living with a rare condition.  In many cases, however, the burden of living with an invisible rare condition is as challenging as the burden faced by those with visible disabilities.  Planning and managing care and medical appointments, managing household chores, accessing education and employment opportunities, social interaction and building relationships are all challenges for people living with rare conditions.<br\/><br\/>People living with rare conditions are often described as having complex medical needs.  Complex medical needs are not an excuse for poor and disorganised provision of care and support.  Complex medical needs are the challenges that are driving enormous innovation in this area today.  Be it whole genome sequencing, orphan medicines, gene therapies, digital living spaces or artificial intelligence, much innovative work is being undertaken today across the globe to address the needs of the rare community.  One might think that Ireland should be a global leader in this space.  After all, we have a huge industrial footprint in pharma, medtech and ICT.  Innovation in the rare disease area is not just about therapies and treatments; innovation is also about how and where care is delivered, and pooling resources across Europe to ensure the best outcomes for all citizens of the EU living with rare conditions.  As citizens of not just Ireland but also the EU, is it unreasonable for us to expect to have access to the same care, treatment and opportunities as our fellow EU citizens in countries such as France, Germany and Denmark?<br\/><br\/>The national rare disease plan, originally published in 2014, must be updated and overhauled to account of the transformations that have taken place in rare disease care and delivery over the past eight to ten years.  The revised plan must also take account of Sl&aacute;intecare, a transformation programme that was not even under consideration in 2014.  As a matter of urgency, we are seeking a commitment from the Department of Health to prioritise people living with rare conditions as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.  People living with rare conditions deserve to benefit from the enhancements in community care spoken of in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is no longer acceptable to think that the rare community can wait.  There are 300,000 people living with rare conditions who must be prioritised.  If we can build a healthcare system that meets the needs of the most vulnerable in our society, it will be a system that meets the needs of everyone in the country.<br\/><br\/>One of the greatest challenges for people living with a rare condition in Ireland today is the diagnostic journey.  Diagnosis is often delayed for many years and involves multiple specialists.<\/p><p>The diagnostic journey is associated with significant hardship for patients and families alike, with unnecessary appointments, referrals, tests and interventions, loss of income and education or career prospects and delayed opportunities for the correct treatment.  Would we accept delayed diagnosis and treatment in other specialties?  We all know what a delayed diagnosis for cancer patients means, yet it is accepted as normal for a rare diagnosis to take several years. <\/p><p> Some 72% of rare conditions are genetic in origin.  Genetic testing, genetic consultation and genetic counselling are thus the fundamental building blocks for diagnoses of rare conditions.  In spite of this, in Ireland, we have a hugely underresourced genetics infrastructure.  The clinical genetics service in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI, at Crumlin provides a diagnostic, counselling and clinical genetic testing service for children and adults affected by or at risk of a genetic condition.  The service is the sole provider of general genetic service to the population of Ireland.  The service cares for and manages families with genetic conditions. <\/p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s review of the clinical genetics medical workforce in Ireland, published in 2019, reveals that there is a lack of a co-ordinated genetic testing service in Ireland, due primarily to funding issues.  There has been no significant investment in the service in the intervening period.  Lack of a co-ordinated genetic testing service has led to poor practice in terms of testing requests and also poor-quality foreign laboratories handling Irish samples.  There is an inherent risk in this.  Additionally, some people, including those without symptoms, have taken it upon themselves to have testing conducted at private laboratory facilities, sometimes without even a referral from their own doctors.  They are desperate to understand what the future may hold for them.  <\/p><p> With normal attrition due to retirement and sick leave and difficulties attracting and hiring qualified personnel, there are currently just three genetic consultants in position in CHI at Crumlin.  The HSE&rsquo;s 2019 review indicates that there should be 15.  The most visible knock-on effect is growing waiting lists.  As of March 2021, there were 3,999 people on the waiting lists for clinical medical genetics, up from 3,052 just one year earlier.  Of these, 1,392 are children under the age of 16.  Typically, the priority waiting list is between 15 and 18 months.  Routine referrals wait over two years to be seen.  As of March, there were 941 people on the waiting list for over 18 months, of which 657 were under the age of 16.  Our health service is failing the children of Ireland. <\/p><p> Genetic counsellors see patients with known genetic disorders, under the direction of a genetic consultant.  The British Clinical Genetics Society, CGS, recommends eight genetic counsellors per 1 million of population.  The department of clinical genetics in CHI at Crumlin currently has approximately six whole-time equivalent genetic counsellors for the entire population of Ireland.  We cannot over-emphasise the critical need for genetic services in Ireland.  Day-to-day management of people living with rare conditions, and the health system as a whole, would benefit from early accurate diagnosis.   There are huge risks in the current system.  People are sitting on waiting lists unnecessarily as they seek a diagnosis.  There is a potential for unqualified personnel to provide diagnoses and treatment based upon difficult to interpret results, and patients taking matters into their own hands seeking testing and diagnosis outside of the normal healthcare environment.  There are also enormous opportunities being missed.  People living with rare conditions are missing out on early access to new therapies and potentially on enrolment in clinical trials for novel therapies. <\/p><p> In the short term we must think creatively about addressing some of the bottlenecks that exist in genetic services today, with a view to building a best-in-class, robust genetics service for future generations.  Genetics are not just the future of healthcare, they are here now.  We need genetic services today that will allow the Irish people to benefit from innovations that are with us now and that prepare us for those that will be with us in the years ahead. <\/p><p> In summary, we are asking for your support today to ensure that the Government delivers on its promises in the programme for Government.  The very first step, we believe, is allocation of resources at the Department of Health to bring leadership and accountability, to update and develop a new national rare disease plan for Ireland and the delivery of world-class genetic and genomic services.  In the past, we have seen the Department of Health provide the leadership necessary to deliver on cancer strategies and plans for the country.  It is not unreasonable to expect a similar commitment to the 300,000 people living with rare conditions and their families and friends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

The reality is that we have 6,000 different rare diseases and one country is not going to solve the problem.  Over the past 30 years European action has led to the development of the first national plan.  We had the European Commission call in 2009, which led to the development of national plans for rare diseases.  A lot of work started on that 13 years ago, so one can imagine that in such a dynamic area things have moved on enormously.  What has happened recently is that over the years we have developed expertise not only in the patient community but also in clinical research and among policymakers to look at what has happened previously in rare diseases and what is about to happen.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission initiated a foresight study two years ago called Rare 2030 to look at what are going to be the necessary actions for the rare diseases community in Europe in the next ten years.  We had 200 experts across Europe working very hard on this.  We had some representatives from Ireland involved. There are eight sensible recommendations to look at developing a framework for rare diseases not only in Europe but in each member state.  They are very simple recommendations.  The first is to develop a new policy framework that will guide us in the implementation of rare disease strategies.  The second is to look at earlier, faster and more accurate diagnoses for rare diseases, which remains one of the most critical challenges for patients and healthcare providers across Europe.  The third recommendation looks at a highly specialised healthcare ecosystem looking at the issue of financial and technical support at European and national levels that leaves no person with a rare disease behind.  Recommendation 4 looks at the guaranteed integration of people living with rare diseases into society.  Recommendation 5 looks at a culture of encouraging meaningful participation and engagement and leadership of people with a rare disease both in the public and private sectors.  Recommendation 6 looks at rare disease research maintenance as a priority for innovation across Europe.  This is something that we can add to in Ireland because we have significant expertise in research and development.  Recommendation 7 also looks at the issue of data and using data to their maximum to improve the health and well-being of people living with a rare disease in Europe.  Recommendation 8 looks to improve the availability, accessibility and affordability of rare disease treatment by attracting investment, fostering innovation and collaboration across countries to address the inequalities.<\/p> <p>  Members can see these are very sensible approaches but, as Ms McGrath stated earlier, we must have proper genetic services or a situation where patients can access genetic testing, which is fundamental not only in the delivery of care for patients who have genetic disease but also leads to innovation because if one has a genetic test one can get on a register and then it can improve access to clinical trials.  One can improve the outcome of clinical trials by monitoring patients and their gene, how it manifests and keeping records of that and understanding how one can improve patient-reported outcome measures.  Ultimately, that creates the infrastructure to deliver innovative genetic and cell therapies that are curative in many cases so we can eliminate the disease.  It all starts at the very beginning.  There is a process to all of this and without the basics in care and diagnosis we cannot have that innovation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to a centre of expertise, in fact, we do have a lot of the expertise, but we are missing the infrastructure.  That is really critical.  One cannot have one without the other.  As sensible as these recommendations are, without the basics and the basic understanding of rare diseases and genetics and where genetics play such a critical part in society, we will not be able to address this framework in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Avril Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am not sure who wants to take the first question, but it relates to waiting lists and backlogs of people who might be seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease.

It will be more than that because the IT systems are down at the moment.  Approximately 1,900 are waiting to see a consultant and another 800 or 900 are waiting to see genetic counsellors.  The genetic counsellor waiting list is better than the consultant waiting list.  We do have some patients waiting up to three years, which is shocking.  We spend our time trying to validate the waiting lists.  We get 3,900 or so referrals per year but we also know that is less than half of the equivalent NHS service.  I did a publication with Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, and Cardiff two years ago and they were getting an average of two referrals per 1,000 people per year whereas we are only getting 0.84.  The reason we are getting that is because we put up road blocks to try to manage our waiting lists.  We no longer see people with this, that or the other.  We try to get the common genetic diseases managed by other specialists.  It is quite difficult to get on our waiting list.  We have to be really strict about it because if the waiting list gets to be so bad it is just unmanageable, and it becomes a risk in itself.  It is difficult to get to see us in the first place and we are not providing a service compared to our NHS colleagues.  We keep doing our best.  We deal with 6% to 7% by information letter as opposed to appointments.  We are trying to be innovative in that way and with Covid many consultations now are on the telephone or via video.  That is working quite well.  We spend our time doing capacity plans and trying to ameliorate the issues, but it is impossible.<\/p> <p>  One of my three colleagues came back from a unit where the population was fewer than 3 million and there were 12 consultants.  She has had a baptism of fire where we are just trying to put out fires all the time, as it were, because the risks are so huge and there are so few of us.  It is very difficult to forward plan.  We do not have the time to do that.  We are considered a centre of expertise.  We do annual clinical quality assessments, which we always do well at.  The tiny number of us who are there do our best to maintain the quality and we participate in the clinical quality assessments within Europe, and Britain is part of it too.  We try to keep up to international standards, but it is just not possible to do what my colleagues in the NHS are doing because there are five of them compared to one of me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sally Ann Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Ms Daly mentioned the need for more holistic genetic services and having a clear pathway from testing right through to therapy.

I was diagnosed with an inherited retinal degeneration, a rare form of sight loss, in 1998, when I was 23 years old.  I knew at that point that it was genetic in origin and that I probably had a recessive condition, meaning it had skipped a generation and popped up in me.  I did not know how the condition was going to progress, because no one else in my family had it, but I knew there were 300 different gene types, so I had to have a genetic test to understand mine.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, I received a genetic test and a diagnosis through Target 5000, a genetic testing and research study funded by a small Irish charity called Fighting Blindness.  This was undertaken by its clinical and research partners at Trinity College Dublin and the Mater Hospital.  I was able to understand my prognosis because of that diagnosis.  I was able to be told what research was being conducted on my gene and I could contribute to the research effort, not only nationally but globally if I wanted to go on a register, which I did.  Moreover, if a clinical trial arrived, I knew they would know where to find me.  A genetic counsellor explained to me on the day of my diagnosis that I did not have a recessive gene but rather a de novo gene, meaning it had started in me.  I cannot begin to explain the relief that gave me to know it was not going to affect me or my family.  I knew I had a mild disease and it could be managed, and I was given a care plan by my consultant at the Mater.  That is critical.  In the absence of treatment, a care pathway is incredibly important.<\/p> <p>  This is all very actionable stuff.  It should not be incumbent on a small Irish charity to develop a world-class service such as this simply because it can and it has the ability to fundraise for it.  There are patients living in this country, and parents with children with life-limiting diseases, who cannot set up a charity to fundraise to get access to these genetic therapies and all the processes involved.  They are finding out, if they ever do, much too late that their child could have been part of a clinical trial.  They are missing life-changing and potentially life-saving treatments.  I got a genetic test after 20 years through a charity.

Dr. Lynch might speak a little about genetic issues specifically and the impact of coronavirus on genetic services.  We conducted a study last year on coronavirus and its impact on patients.  It was mind-boggling.  A person living with a rare condition might be the only one in the country with it, so there is a lack of knowledge about different rare conditions.  It is not the fault of any particular consultant or doctor.  It is just the nature of rare conditions.  They are complex and not many people have them so it is very difficult to have a full understanding.  When coronavirus arrived, patients worried about their underlying rare condition now had an unknown virus lumped in on top of them.  It was terrifying them.

That is fine because there is a system called mainstreaming.  When mainstreaming occurred in the NHS, major controls were put in place in terms of education and complex genetic test reports.  That has not happened in Ireland.  For example, when a new antenatal test was brought in by the NHS, it had approximately seven different subgroups and one major steering group before it was introduced across the NHS.  That did not happen in Ireland, but the foetal medicine specialists were medically and legally obliged to offer these new tests.  They were just offered without any support, or minimal support, from clinical geneticists because we do not have the capacity.  There were no steering groups or subgroups, nothing.  That is really where the issue is.<\/p> <p>  Many tests can be done by other specialists but they are better done in a safe, controlled environment with service level agreements with the laboratories that do them, which ends up offering cheaper tests anyway.  There should also be proper consent because informed consent is meant to be taken from patients for these tests.  There are significant concerns because whenever tests are brought in internationally, within Europe, all these controls will look at every single different aspect before they are offered to populations.  This is so the safest test is offered in a good quality laboratory with supports when a result comes back that might be a little complex, so the patient is not left with an \"Oh look, not sure what is going on here\" response.  Not every genetic test is clear-cut.  They are not always black and white.  They can be muddy shades of grey that can be very difficult to interpret.<\/p> <p>  Not everything has to be done in Ireland.

For example, if the eye genes for a child with an eye disorder are targeted, in America they are also obliged when doing that sort of broad test to inform the patient about alterations in certain cancer or cardiac sudden death genes.  That is the American stance.  The European stance is quite different.  We are saying just look at the genes relating to the clinical query in the first place and do not look otherwise.  I very much agree with the European stance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sally Ann Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Okay.

We are learning as the treatment is rolled out.  We do not have the registers to monitor that, which is a challenge for the HSE.  One can understand where that challenge is.

A report was published yesterday, which is conducted on an annual basis, on access to medicines.  This is hot of the presses.  Of the 47 orphan medicines that were approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, in the four years 2016 to 2019, eight of them are available in Ireland today.  They are, therefore, on the reimbursement list in Ireland today.  Some 96% of them are available in Germany, 85% are available in Denmark and 72% in England in the UK.  In Scotland, a similar country to our own, the figure is 47%.<\/p> <p>  Our system is hindering access.  I know that we talk an awful lot about reimbursements of medicines and pricing and so on.

I am aware of this new retinal drug and gene therapy that is available.

It is a fascinating debate, which was prevalent in the previous D&aacute;il with regard to access to orphan drugs, particularly scenarios where families were campaigning to get access to these transformative medications.<\/p> <p>   Other Deputies and I got to know organisations, particularly those families campaigning for the drug Kuvan to treat phenylketonuria, PKU, Orkambi for cystic fibrosis, CF, and Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy, SMA.  All these families campaigned hard, for years in some cases, in difficult circumstances.  They obtained the medication eventually through much hard work and many hard years of lobbying with regard to the criteria, which are quite stringent.<\/p> <p>  It is my understanding that the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics gave the price structure for some of these orphan drugs, which are sometimes made in Ireland.  These medications can be at very high cost, however.  The pharmaceutical companies probably do not see where they can make a lot of money on these cases, which they can in most instances.  That needs to be looked at with regard to the cost of orphan drugs, particularly in respect of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.<\/p><p>I am aware that many of the families stated that the criteria around the reimbursement was very protracted and went on for years in some cases.  My question is underpinned by the 2013 legislation, which is the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Other members who were Deputies in the previous D&aacute;il have said that this Act needs to be amended to be cognisant of orphan drugs that need to be accessible to those rare conditions.  The narrative, which was very prevalent and true, is that these drugs were transformative.  The great thing about modern medicine is that these medications can be life-changing yet, at the same time, people cannot gain access to them.  I find it very difficult to comprehend that there is a medication out there that could be of great benefit but it cannot be obtained because of price.  We do not live in a civilised society if a child cannot get a medication because of price.  That needs to be looked at and medications like that need to be accessible.  Is it any easier now to gain access to orphan drugs?  My feeling is that it is not.

Often, if someone waits a long time for these therapies to be administered because he or she is looking to alleviate cost, then this is a false economy because this patient is going through this odyssey of different types of what are perhaps often inappropriate interventions or ones that are no longer suitable for them because they are now immune to those therapies.  There are many different complexities around this.  I draw the attention of the Deputy in the context of again being practical about this to looking at where we can potentially work with our European partners to address an issue that is common to many countries.  The eighth recommendation of the Rare 2030: Foresight in Rare Disease Policy study, states that we need to improve the three \"As\", availability, accessibility, and affordability, of rare disease treatments by attracting investment, fostering innovation and collaboration across countries.  We are not going to solve this problem on our own and we need to work together.  There are initiatives coming out of Europe and looking at this right now.<\/p> <p>  Once a therapy is approved by the EMA for safety and efficacy, it comes to 70 different agencies across Europe, including our own, where we have to reassess based on health technology and value assessments .  Perhaps there are ways that we can work together with our European partners, instead of having all of these individual processes, which are very different from each other, towards having a uniform process that could allow us to get better and cheaper access to these therapies.  These are incentives that we need to be involved with as a small country and from which we could benefit.  It is within those recommendations and it is something that the Government very much need to review, in the context of and going back to previous points about the national plan that was published in 2014.  We have moved on and we need to review these with a new lens based upon where we are right now.

At the time the Government bought the drug, it said that 5% of the population had the specific mutation that would allow them to be treated because the treatment is specific to a certain mutation.  We did a paper last year and although the Government believed it was 5% based on UK data, in actual fact 15% of the Irish population carry that mutation.  We would have done a different deal and have received a cheaper rate if we had our data.  That goes back to registries.  We may be talking about everything as being rare but often we find that if we simply get the data and the infrastructure to simply count and have a registry, there is a greater number of patients and we will then get a cheaper drug.

I will keep trying until I am dead.<\/p> <p>  The setting up of the training scheme was delayed as a result of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  No new training was allowed to be set up, so that delayed the start of our training programme by seven years, which was critical time lost.  I was the person who set up the training scheme and it was difficult to get buy-in from the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI, because small specialties tend to get squashed by the larger specialties.  To get to the goal of 15 consultants, it is important to recruit and train locally because one just cannot recruit from abroad.  For example, as I mentioned, there are six consultants in Northern Ireland.  All of them, as well as three consultants who have now retired, trained in Northern Ireland, apart from the original person.  The health service there knows it cannot recruit either, so it has put big efforts into training locally.  That is what we have to do.  We have one post and are hoping to be given a second but as there is such a small mass of consultants, one cannot have too many trainees.  One would need more consultants to accommodate more trainees because it is not fair on the trainee if he or she never sees the consultant because he or she is too busy.   It is a serious issue.  Many of us will be retiring quite soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sally Ann Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lynch for addressing the issue a second time.  My apologies for bringing it up again.  I always throw the net out when there is a topic coming up for discussion at the committee.  I spoke to a couple of people who have rare diseases.  I spoke to a person who has myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, and explained the situation.  Approximately 14,000 people in Ireland have this neurological disease but it is not recognised here.  The person to whom I spoke told me about the lack of support from his or her GP, who said the condition does not exist and was not supportive and so on.  Would it be fair to say that is not a stand-alone situation in terms of people with rare diseases struggling in the context of not being able access disability benefit because of the approach taken by their GPs?  My impression from what the witnesses have said is that it is not a stand-alone circumstance, given the complexities around rare diseases, even though such a high number of people suffer from a rare disease, with 6% of the population affected, as was stated.  It is about these smaller things.  What does the committee need to do or what otherwise needs to be done to get buy-in - that is probably the wrong word - from GPs or a recognition by them of some of these rare diseases such that people do not have to rely on Chinese whispers that they will be believed by a particular GP or that another GP recognises this disease?<\/p><p>How can we move on from this kind of Chinese whispers process regarding who to see and arrive at a more comprehensive and generalised recognition by GPs of some of these rare diseases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#J00700","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I can jump in here.  This is an interesting question.  The biggest challenge we face in this regard is general awareness and we have made some progress in this area.  A fabulous campaign is run in the US to raise awareness of rare diseases.  It uses the symbol of a zebra to highlight that a galloping sound does not always signify a horse.  One of our biggest challenges, therefore, is to make our GP community and healthcare providers more generally think about the possibility of rare diseases and realise that it is not always a common condition that is manifesting and that it is necessary to keep rare diseases in mind as well.<\/p> <p>  Realistically, however, with 6,000 rare conditions in existence, most GPs during their careers will only ever see a handful of patients with rare conditions, never mind someone from each of the categories.  A patient, however, might be unfortunate enough to have a condition suffered by only 50 people globally.  Recognition is a battle in that context.  I do not fault our healthcare providers.  They do not always have the time or opportunity to think about these rare conditions because they are very complex and that is where we need joined-up thinking in a European context.  A person with a set of unusual symptoms could then start to access expertise across Europe and further afield internationally.  It does sometimes happen.  <\/p> <p>  One challenge that families in this situation typically face in the context of young children who have what may appear to be developmental delays is what they would describe as being fobbed off.  The child will be fine in many cases, but, in some instances, that will not be the outcome.  What is required is a match between a worried parent and a healthcare provider who will be able to determine whether the issues in question are real or provide reassurance that what is being experienced is perfectly normal.  It is an interesting aspect, and I have seen this from a personal perspective with my child who has a minor issue.  We do not know quite what it is and some five years later we are still trying to work out the answer.  Parents reassure one another regarding these situations, however, and they are great at doing that.<\/p> <p>  More children being involved in the early childhood care and education schemes means they are now being seen by professionals who are very familiar with children and who may notice things that may seem a bit unusual.  We must be able to build on that and ensure that parents are not left alone in a situation where it might seem they are just being overly worried.  They must be able to have conversations with other professionals and parents.  It is an ongoing battle and it will continue to be a battle for a long time, until such time as our doctors are able to know everything about all our conditions, which is never going to happen.  This will always be an issue, but by building awareness we at least make our healthcare providers think of rare diseases and that is the first step.  If they are thinking of rare conditions, there is at least the possibility of moving on more quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGrath for that answer.  I had a conversation with a person who suffers from a rare disease and who feels the only way it is possible to describe the situation at present is that there is a price on life in this country.  The experience of the health system has left the person feeling that way.  No treatment is currently available for the condition in question, but there may be in a few years.  It will cost a great deal of money, though, and the person does not have much confidence that the money required will be forthcoming.  I speak to such individuals to try to get a perspective on issues and I do not want to create the impression that this is how it is for everyone.<\/p> <p>  It was remarked earlier, however, that a cost, and a cost-benefit analysis, is attached to everything.  Does Ms McGrath think perhaps there is a price on life in our health service?  We say there never is.  Ultimately, however, if people are unable to get the treatments they require, and, as has been stated, if only 16% of orphan treatments are available in Ireland compared with 90% in Germany, then that statistic tells me that some sort of price must be being put on well-being, care and life.  I find it hard to hear that.  It is really frustrating that there are people in Ireland who feel that a price has been put on their lives and the Government is not willing to pay it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#K00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I would like to say that there is not.  We have ended up with a narrative concerning access to medicines and drug reimbursements that attracts much media coverage.  It is not a pretty conversation and that is what has brought people to lean towards the view that a price is being applied.  People in the health system dealing with their consultants and GPs, or whomever it might be, have a very different view.  The best care the system can deliver will be received.  There are blockages in the system and limitations on what can be done because of the infrastructure in our healthcare system.  We cannot offer people access to clinical trials because we do not even know if a person is eligible for a particular trial.  These are system-wide blockages, which need to be removed.  Part of the problem in this regard involves the budget, but to a large extent it can also be a case of the time required and the difficulty involved.  We must all say that we are going to step forward and start making the required changes.<\/p> <p>  It worries me that people think it is all about the price of a drug; it is not.  There are so many other elements.  Many people are living with rare conditions that will never see a therapy devised and they are seeking supports in the community to allow them to lead the best life that is possible for them and their families.  We cannot put all the aspects involved down to there just being a price.  There is not.  We need a system.  We heard Dr. Lynch talk about the role of training geneticists.  That should not be an issue.  We have similar problems with healthcare providers and supports in other areas, such as in psychotherapy, for example.  Some psychotherapists and other specialists may be reluctant to deal with people living with rare conditions they do not know about or understand.  They are concerned that the result of their intervention might be more harmful than beneficial.  We must create the requisite knowledge, awareness and understanding in such areas and show people we are willing to give them the best lives possible, notwithstanding the fact that a therapy may not be available.  Where therapies are available, we require a system that will provide them as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGrath again for her answer.  I am looking at my notes, and I see that another person to whom I spoke also told me a treatment that may be available in a few years will potentially cost nearly &euro;500,000 as well.  I do not know if that is a generalised figure given to people.  I spoke to nine or ten different people with rare diseases ahead of this meeting and it struck me as sad that they felt the way they did in this regard.  The responsibility for that being the case lies with those of us in the political system.  I refer to a situation where it is known that a treatment for a condition may be available and the people with the condition are willing to do whatever is required because their lives are being affected, and yet they feel that the required political or medical support will not be forthcoming.<\/p> <p>  I cannot imagine what it would be like to live with that feeling of facing an uphill battle to get support.  Ms McGrath spoke eloquently throughout this session about these uphill battles that people face in trying to get recognition and support, or just to be believed.  It struck me that it is not good enough that we have people who feel that even if a treatment were to become available, they will not be able to avail of it because of the lack of structural support in Ireland.  I apologise for having talked at the witness for this past while.

Ms McGrath stated that physiotherapists or occupational therapists might not know about a particular rare disease or have the full complement of education on it but my experience relates to dieticians.  My child has a rare disease and I have a real difficulty with them in regard to that sensory issue.  The hierarchy of how those community teams work is going to be incredibly important in terms of who knows what and who is in charge of what.  What are the priorities from the perspective of the witnesses both in terms of the pathway to accessing genetic testing, care and counselling and on the other side once a person has the diagnosis accessing the correct soft supports?  The question is for both Dr. Lynch and Ms McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052600002#K00800","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The multidisciplinary team would be a godsend.  It would provide one-stop shopping for the patient and see patient-centred care beginning to be realised.  It is not always easy to achieve but it would be useful and would enable patients to know that their healthcare providers are talking to one another and can see the whole person again, that it is not just their sensory issues or whatever the issue might be.  It also provides a patient and a family with one point of contact.<\/p> <p>  We have a system that is transitioning towards patient-based needs and that is what is needed.  People with the same diagnosis and the same genetic condition will have different challenges.  They will have different needs and we must make sure that we are listening to the patient and that we are addressing the specific needs of patients and that it is not a box-ticking exercise but is customised for individual patients.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues I found when we were looking at the effect of coronavirus on the rare disease community relates to the use of telemedicine and consultations online.  Some patients really liked it and others did not.  It is down to that kind of level of personalised preferences being allowed and the fact that today I like telemedicine but next week I might not.  I know it makes the system a little more complex to run but it needs to be done because this is how we ensure that the most vulnerable in society are being listened to, are being heard and are having their needs met.

We see adults as well and we do foetal medicine.  Most of the queries are coming in to us from adult physicians or foetal medicine physicians but we cannot do those peripheral clinics any more.  Every person trying to access that type of care now needs to travel, as there is no regional access.  We provide telephone and video appointments.

I also thank the witnesses.  As we have the time, I have a couple of questions before they go.  Before the meeting I did some research myself online on some of the challenges we face.  To be honest, I had never heard of most of the rare diseases.  People said motor neurone is a rare disease, but it was not on the list, although 350 people are diagnosed with it every year.  Many of the diseases I am aware of did not seem to be on the list.  I saw a shocking figure indicating that 30% of children will die before their fifth birthday from a rare disease.  I presume that is a worldwide figure.  Reference was made to 6% of the population in Ireland or 300,000 who have a rare disease and 30 million in the EU so it makes sense that we would take an EU-wide approach.  I am interested in the witnesses coming back to us to outline how they would see that roll-out and what we as a committee could do regarding it.<\/p> <p>  It was stated that a major overhaul of the existing plan needs to be done.  The previous report talked about timely access to diagnosis, treatment, care through all stages of life and a clinical care pathway programme.  What I heard this morning is that it is clearly not coming through for many people with rare diseases in Ireland.  It was also said that the witnesses have not had sight nor sound of the review itself.<\/p><p>We, as a committee, will ask for that review and try to get it.  It does not make sense that when a report is done, it would not be made available.  Likewise, in regard to orphan drugs, if a report has been done on that issue, the committee will follow through on it.  Again, it does not make sense that such a report, if there is one, would not be released.<\/p><p> On the question of co-operation between the North and the South, we are hoping to meet with our committee counterpart in the North of Ireland.  It would be helpful in this regard if the witnesses could come back to us on what aspects of co-operation could be improved, not only in terms of engagement between geneticists but also other areas of co-operation.  It makes sense that systems of co-operation between experts on the island should be developed as much as possible.  I expect that both the administrations in the North and in this State would be very much in favour of rolling out that type of engagement.<\/p><p> I listened with interest to what the witnesses said about people missing out on clinical trials.  The key point I am taking is that a delayed diagnosis means the follow-up does not happen.<\/p><p> Reference was made to big pharma in Ireland and the fact we have attracted so many pharmaceutical companies, as well as IT companies.  There is a debate to be had about how we could use that to benefit people.  We did not have time to get into this particular issue but it is frustrating for many of us to hear about the cyberattacks that have taken places, knowing there are so many IT companies in Ireland.  There does not seem to be a system whereby we could call on that expertise and those resources.  There is a similar frustration in regard to big pharma and not only the development but also the pricing of drugs.  The point was made that, in some cases, the development of orphan drugs and their roll-out is not about the associated cost but the greed of the pharmaceutical companies in terms of the amount they are looking to charge health services for them.  There must be a responsibility on legislators in that regard.  I understand there has been considerable lobbying by a number of pharmaceutical companies, which involved contacting people to try to get them to put pressure on Oireachtas Members in terms of rolling out certain drugs.  We all accept there is a problem in regard to the orphan drugs being cleared and so on.  If the witnesses have some suggestions in that regard, we would be glad to hear them.<\/p><p> Much of what is said about saving money is nonsense.  We have had people before the committee who told us about the impact of certain diseases on their quality of life.  In the long term, it is costing the health service and the Exchequer a lot more if people need to stay longer in the health system.<\/p><p> We did not have time this morning to get into the area of artificial intelligence and the role it could play in developing a testing programme for rare diseases.  This is probably something that needs to be discussed with geneticists.  The testing programme I am familiar with is the heel test that is performed on newborns.  Do the witnesses see that as a possible way forward in identifying other diseases that children may be born with?  Realistically, how do they see a programme being rolled out to test the entire population in terms of DNA, genetics and so on?  Should such testing be confined, for example, to young couples and expectant women?  There has been some testing going on regarding bowel cancer, which has been quite successful.  How would the witnesses see that type of testing being rolled out to identify rare diseases?  Are there simple things that could be done better than how they are currently being done?<\/p><p> Reference was made to innovation in how care is delivered.  I am sure we are all in favour of that.  There is clearly a way forward in respect of telemedicine.  We are all having to think differently in how we operate and the health service probably needs to take that on board, particularly given there are so few geneticists in the country.  We will probably have to look at new ways of rolling out supports and diagnoses through telemedicine and other means.<\/p><p> It has been very useful to hear from the witnesses this morning and I appreciate their contributions.  If they feel there were issues we did not have time to cover during the meeting, I ask that they write to the committee with suggestions in that regard.  We certainly will take those suggestions on board and put them through the system.

There is very limited structured coursework on rare conditions available through the universities.  A consideration of the type of education that is needed is part of the need for joined-up thinking around the delivery of a new plan.

Before we start, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the bravery of the two members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were shot and injured yesterday evening in Blanchardstown.  This shocking event reminds us all of the dangers in which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na put themselves every day to protect us.  I also pay tribute to the other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who responded to the incident without any further injuries.  I acknowledge the full support and co-operation they received from the other first responders.  I wish both garda&iacute; a swift recovery and thank them and all those who responded last night to what was a very difficult and dangerous situation.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend to discuss the 2021 Further Revised Estimates for the Department of Social Protection.  Almost exactly a year ago, this committee considered the first ever Social Protection Estimate to include spending related to income supports introduced to provide assistance to people whose jobs and livelihoods were impacted by the pandemic.  I am here today, one year later, to discuss the continuation of that support as we thankfully begin to work our way out of what has been a very dark time for our economy and society.  As we all know, Covid-19 has presented many diverse and complex challenges for society, for the economy and for the Government in supporting our people who are dealing with these challenges daily.  The speed of reaction required to deal with the ever-changing nature of the pandemic required decisions to be made quickly, and that is what the Government did.  Across all branches of the Government, services and supports were galvanised to develop and deliver innovative measures designed to mitigate as far as possible the impact of Covid on the lives of our people.  One of the critical challenges has been how to support workers who are suddenly without the means to support themselves and their families.  This is why we have a social protection system and why it is important to secure the resources that allow us to respond efficiently and effectively in real time.  The roll-out of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in a very short space of time proved my Department's capacity to be responsive in providing invaluable income supports.  The scope and range of other supports such as an enhanced Covid illness benefit and the flexibility introduced to rent supplement contributed to easing the financial impact of the virus on the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate which the committee is to consider today reflects an ongoing commitment to supporting those who continue to be affected by the pandemic and all the Department's customers who need our support on an ongoing basis.  When the 2021 Estimate was originally compiled in October 2020, parts of the country were at either level 2 or level 3 of the public health restrictions.  That Estimate envisaged expenditure in 2021 of &euro;25.13 billion based on Government decisions that had been made at the time, including that pandemic supports such as the PUP and employment wage subsidy scheme would close at the end of March.  The resurgence of the virus in the weeks and months which followed led to the Government deciding to extend payment of and access to the PUP until the end of June 2021.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, was similarly extended to the end of June 2021.  These decisions, as well as the extension of other Covid-related spending, mean that further funding is required in 2021 to meet these new commitments.<\/p><p>An additional &euro;4.1 billion in funding is required, bringing the Estimate for the Department&rsquo;s spending to &euro;29.14 billion.<\/p><p> The primary drivers of the increase in social protection spending in 2021 are the schemes which provide support to the parts of the economy that continue to suffer the consequences of the Covid crisis.  Nearly 20% or &euro;5.75 billion of the total departmental spending of &euro;29.14 billion is attributable to Covid-related schemes.  PUP expenditure is estimated at &euro;3.3 billion or more than 11% of the total 2021 expenditure.  The funding of Revenue&rsquo;s employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, is estimated to be &euro;2.36 billion, representing 8.1% of the 2021 Estimate.  The Estimate also reflects the fact that the Social Insurance Fund, SIF, from which PUP is funded, is now in deficit.  The &euro;453 million surplus in the fund at the beginning of 2021 has now been eliminated.  SIF expenditure for the year is projected to be &euro;15.34 billion.  With SIF income projections of &euro;11.13 billion, the deficit for the year is projected to be &euro;4.22 billion.  Taking account of the 2020 surplus carried forward, the deficit, which will be funded by the Exchequer through the Department&rsquo;s Vote, will be &euro;3.76 billion in 2021.<\/p><p> As Minister for Social Protection, I never lose sight of the fact that our core business is the provision of income support throughout the course of people&rsquo;s lives.  Pension expenditure continues to be the biggest element of social protection spending.  It represents more than 30% of total expenditure and amounts to &euro;8.8 billion in 2021.  Working age income supports, with projected expenditure of &euro;7.9 billion, account for 27% of projected expenditure.  This includes &euro;3.3 billion for PUP expenditure up to the end of June 2021.  It also includes &euro;3.2 billion on jobseeker payments for the year.  Illness, disability and carers payments, with expenditure of &euro;4.9 billion, make a significant contribution towards supporting the most vulnerable in society and represents 16.8% of overall 2021 spending.  Working age employment supports cater for a range of schemes aimed at helping people get or retain employment and have a projected spend of &euro;3.3 billion or 11.3% of 2021 expenditure.  Included in this figure is a &euro;2.36 billion provision for the EWSS.  Expenditure on children is nearly &euro;2.7 billion in 2021 or 9.1% of overall social protection spending.  The supplementary payments programme funds are a range of household benefits, free travel, fuel allowance and other schemes.  It represents 3% of the projected 2021 spend at &euro;878 million.<\/p><p> Currently, the live register records the number of unemployed as 173,293.  This does not, however, include those on the PUP.  To provide an assessment of the cost of supporting those not in employment throughout the year, the Estimate applied the unemployment rates underpinning the April 2021 stability programme update.  Based on these quarterly unemployment rates, the numbers unemployed in each quarter, whether on PUP or jobseeker payments in the first two quarters, or jobseeker payments for the second half of the year, were determined.  The Estimate is, therefore, based on a robust foundation of the 2021 unemployment costs, which is not revealed by live register numbers alone.<\/p><p> The broad overview I have presented to members of Vote 37 expenditure, is developed in greater detail in the comprehensive briefing material provided to the committee last week.  It is, however, important to note that the expenditure underpinning this further Revised Estimate is based on decisions made at a point in time in a constantly evolving environment.  The Government is actively considering how we continue to provide supports beyond June as we enter a new phase of the pandemic, where many people have returned to their jobs and people gain back the freedoms that were curtailed due to public health restrictions.<\/p><p> It is encouraging that, in recent weeks, we have seen in excess of 100,000 people leave the PUP and return to employment and self-employment.  The coming weeks will see that progress continuing.  Research from the ESRI and others has shown that the Department&rsquo;s response to the pandemic cushioned the financial shock for people throughout the State as the crisis hit, particularly for those in the lower income deciles.  In excess of &euro;7.6 billion has been spent on PUP alone.  Some 23 million payments have been issued, with 865,000 people receiving at least one payment.  More than 10 million calls have been answered.  I acknowledge committee members and the Chairman have acknowledged the huge efforts by staff of the Department in every county to ensure people got the support they needed, when they needed it, during what has been a hugely challenging period for our country.  I look forward to hearing members' views and answering their questions over the next few hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#A00400","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Aire, as ucht do chur i l&aacute;thair.

Will new people be able to go on the PUP after that or is it intended to cease it?  We need clarification.  People are dependent on this payment.  Many people will not be back to work according to figures from the Minister's Department in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled.  On 1 July, it is estimated that there will be 325,000 people in receipt of PUP.  When will decisions be made on this so that people can plan with some certainty as to where they are going?<\/p> <p>  The second issue the Minister might clarify relates to the projected figure of 345,000 PUP recipients in the first week of June.  She said there has been a drop of 100,000 in the past month.  What is the latest figure she has for the number in receipt of PUP from this week or last week?  Are we going to overshoot or undershoot the end of May-beginning of June target?  Can she explain why we always go through this charade of not providing for the Christmas bonus in the budget calculations or in the Estimates?  It makes year-on-year comparisons difficult to gauge, because it looks as if there is an over expenditure on the previous year but there is not really.  The reality is that the bonus was paid out and it is not provided for in the Estimate.  The Minister might explain why it is not provided.  Is it intended to be back, as I hope?  I presume she will confirm there will be a Christmas bonus.  There is this situation of going through the year with people not knowing whether they are going to get it.  There will be utter shock in the system if people did not get it.  The Minister might explain that.<\/p> <p>  Third, how good is cyber control in the Minister's Department?  We have seen what happened and can imagine what would happen if there was a ransomware attack on the social welfare system and payments could not be made.  It is too horrible to think about.  How prepared is the Department?  It has a large range of systems, some of which are much older than others, and that they are constantly being renewed.  That could pose problems.  What is the situation, and will there be an immediate step up in protecting our social welfare system?  After health, social welfare and Revenue seem to me to be the two key services in our system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#B00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for raising all those questions.  I will try to take them but he should come back to me if I leave any out.  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a significant investment in the PUP.  At its peak in May 2020, more than 600,000 people were availing of the payment and, as restrictions were eased, the numbers dropped to just over 200,000 in October 2020.  That clearly shows that as the economy reopens, people want to get back to work.  The future of the PUP continues at current rates and remains open for new applications until the end of June.  The Government will set out the future of the PUP in the coming weeks, probably at the start of June.  As one might imagine, I am talking to my Government colleagues about a pathway out of the PUP.  We will soon have a better sense of how things are going with the vaccine roll-out, the number of new cases and the trajectory of the virus, and we will also have a clearer picture in terms of the numbers returning to work.  We have been clear that there will be no cliff edge for people.  We certainly have not been found wanting as a Government in regard to supporting people who have been out of work through no fault of their own.  I will meet my Government colleagues in the coming week and we hope to make an announcement in early June.<\/p> <p>  The current number of people receiving the PUP is 345,000.  We project that the unemployment number on Friday, 25 June, will stand at 523,281.  We estimate that 330,047 will be on the PUP and 193,234 on the traditional jobseeker's payments.  This estimate was based on assumptions made in April 2021, before the Government announcements on 28 April that have seen the reopening of sectors of the economy, with a significant number of exits from the PUP.  We are doing much better than we had anticipated because the economy has reopened.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Christmas bonus is announced at budget time and is not provided in the Estimates.  The briefing provided to the committee shows last year's expenditure without the bonus to aid comparison.  The decision to pay the Christmas bonus is something the Department and I discuss with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p> <p>  On the cyberattack issue, the Department has a full-time information security team, headed at principal officer level, and operates an information security management system, developed to meet the requirements of the industry standard ISO 27001.  The Department adopts a security-by-design and defence-in-depth approach to cybersecurity, meaning the system and networks are designed and built with a view to minimising the risk of a security breach.  Operational practices are developed and deployed to identify and deal with any breaches that may be attempted.  The Department ICT systems are fully operational and are always monitored from a cybersecurity perspective.  The recent HSE cyber incident has not affected the Department's core payment systems.<\/p> <p>  Out of an abundance of caution, the Department has deployed extensive additional cyberdefence mechanisms to provide additional reassurance.  Nothing abnormal has been detected to date.  The Department's information security team continues to monitor events closely and is liaising with the National Cyber Security Centre.  This is an issue of which we are very conscious in the Department and much work goes into it.  Sometimes we are criticised when we make announcements because there may be a lead-in time to putting those payments into effect, but one of the reasons there is a lead-in time is we have to build the system securely to ensure there are no cracks where hackers can get in.  We are conscious that these criminals - they are criminals - are becoming more and more expert in their work, and we continue to monitor the issue closely at the Department.  We are conscious that we hold a large volume of data and that the work we do is very important to people's daily lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#C00100","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.  On the PUP, I appreciate that she cannot make a decision at this time but the initial plan was from April to move those remaining on the PUP over to the jobseeker's payments.  Is that still being considered or what is likely to happen?<\/p> <p>  Has an extension of the fuel allowance, as it was last year, been considered by the Department?<\/p> <p>  Some people were moved from the PUP to jobseeker's payments because of the qualified child provision and so on.  On the short-time work support, for workers such as those in airlines who are working on reduced days and whose industries have not fully reopened, they may be running out of the 234 days they are allowed to remain on that scheme and running out of their PRSI stamps.  What are the options for them?  Would the Department examine extending the time that people can remain on the likes of the short-time work support or the jobseeker's benefit, given that their industries are not fully up and running?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to the rent supplement and how that was made available for people during Covid, which was welcome.  It was made available, has been extended to the end of the year, for people in domestic violence situations   Has the Department considered leaving that there permanently as a support for domestic violence victims or survivors?  I think that would be important.<\/p> <p>  According to the Estimates, the blind pension accounts for a cost of roughly &euro;12 million to &euro;13 million every year - small money, I think the Minister would agree, relative to the size of the social protection budget.  I recently met an artist who is in receipt of the blind pension, as I mentioned to the Minister the other day.  She has to be careful about awards and bursaries because the blind pension is means tested.  It reminded me of a case in my constituency office last year where the partner of a blind lady got a promotion and pay rise, which led to her losing her blind pension.  The blind pension is unique in the list of means-tested social welfare payments in that if my partner's income increases, I am still blind.  For an artist, it must be so difficult worrying about taking a gig or winning something in case he or she loses the blind pension.  Should the blind pension not be treated differently?  If a person is blind, he or she is blind for life.  That should be examined and I would appreciate if the Minister would undertake to do that.  It is small money for a small number of people.<\/p> <p>  I met staff members from the EmployAbility scheme yesterday.  They are concerned about the tender and what is happening with the future of EmployAbility.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is a unique service, aimed at persons with a disability or with mental health issues.  Can she give any certainty on the issue?  I acknowledge the Department is tendering out for job clubs in the local employment service, LES, but what are the plans for other schemes?  What is the future for the likes of T&uacute;s and community employment?  Will the Department tender out or contract out for all these services?  The Minister might give an update.<\/p> <p>  I have previously raised with the Minister the issue of the widow's pension.  The legislation is very outdated, given that it still requires the recipient to have been married in order to receive the widow's pension.  I accept it is complicated and there are legal impacts and so on, but some of these people may have been with someone for 20 or 30 years.  On the radio last week, there was a story about a person who had hoped to get married last March.  The woman became very sick and the wedding had to be cancelled because of Covid.  She later died, sadly, and the partner was left with nothing.  Where there are kids or dependants or where someone has been in a relationship for long enough, there should be some way around this and these people should be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#C00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The first issue she raised relates to the PUP.  As I stated, I am considering various options in terms of the PUP as the economy reopens.  I am discussing it with my Government colleagues and I will be in a position to make an announcement in early June.  We are working very hard on it and I am conscious of several issues that we are taking into consideration.<\/p> <p>  As regards the fuel allowance, it is paid to 372,000 low-income households.  In 2020, an increase of four weeks was provided on a once-off basis.  Although I understand these are difficult times, especially for the vulnerable, any further measures have to be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  In this regard, it is important to note the scale of the support provided throughout the pandemic, with more than &euro;7.6 billion paid out on the PUP alone.  Budget 2020 increased the fuel allowance by &euro;3.50 per week from January 2021, ensuring recipients benefited from the increased payment through the winter.  Finally, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet once-off costs, including heating costs.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the short-time working support, where a person has been temporarily placed on a shorter working week, he or she may be entitled to part-time jobseeker's payment or short-time work.  As the Deputy stated, several workers in the airline sector have been availing of some of these supports.  Where a recipient of jobseeker's benefit is working for part of a week, the amount of jobseeker's benefit he or she is paid is based on a five-day week.  This means that for each day the person is employed, one fifth of the normal rate of jobseeker's benefit is deducted from his or her payment.  The jobseeker's benefit payment week is calculated on a six-day week, with one fifth deducted for each day worked.  The sixth day is an unpaid day but counts towards the cumulative total each week.  The duration of the payment of jobseeker's benefit is nine months or 234 days for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions.  It is paid for six months or 156 days for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions.  It is a fundamental feature of the Department's range of benefit payments, including jobseeker's benefit, that the payment is time-limited.  Time limits apply across a range of PRSI-related schemes, such as maternity benefit and illness benefit.  Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseeker's benefit short-time work support, he or she may be eligible for support under the jobseeker's allowance scheme.  The Department will contact recipients of jobseeker's benefit short-time work support ten weeks and four weeks in advance of the expiry of their payment.<\/p> <p>  As regards the blind pension, it is a means-tested payment.  We can examine the means test in the context of the budgetary process.  I accept the Deputy's point that if one is blind, one is blind for life, but we have to examine the issue because there are other medical conditions that, unfortunately, are also life-long conditions.  I will consider the issue.<\/p> <p>  On victims of domestic violence, the pilot scheme will run until the end of the year.  It has been a valuable scheme, especially in terms of providing support to victims of domestic violence such that they did not have to remain in the premises or in a very difficult situation.  It is something that I very much support and I will certainly be looking at it towards the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the employability scheme, last Monday I met those running one of the schemes in my county and had a good long chat with them about the wonderful service they provide.  One thing that struck me is that those running the employability scheme place people in jobs but it is the follow-up they do that is really important.  If there are problems between the employer and the employee, they are able to facilitate addressing those issues.  That is key to their success because they have been doing really good work.  Some of those with whom they are dealing are long-term unemployed and vulnerable people and I take this opportunity to thank them for their work, as did the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware, we are expanding several schemes and I hope to publish the request for tender for the expanded schemes very shortly.  The employability scheme goes to the end of the year.  We have no plans as yet in that regard but, as the Deputy is aware and as I explained to the staff running the scheme, because of procurement rules we will have to put it out to tender in due course.  At this point, the employability scheme continues.  Just as the scheme is encouraging people to have the confidence to find new work and take up employment, those running it should have the confidence that they are well able to bid for this work.  I am very confident, given their track record, the work they do and their involvement in the community, that they have a very good chance of winning the contracts.  <\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point regarding the widow's pension in the context of partners.  Last year, I increased the grant that get widows and surviving civil partners get.  It is a once-off payment of &euro;8,000.  It had not been increased for many years.  When a person is bereaved, it is a very difficult time for him or her.  I was of the view that there is a lot of expense involved now with funerals and such things, so I increased the grant by &euro;2,000 to &euro;8,000.  It is available.  I take the Deputy's point.  We review all our schemes to make sure they are suitable and meet the needs of citizens.  As the Deputy can imagine, the legal context governs relationships such as marriage.  It is regulated by the Minster for Justice.  I suppose I will have to speak to her as well.  The status of marriage and civil partnerships is a much broader policy area than its implications in this regard.  I will certainly consider the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#D00100","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the report.  As regards the PUP, members are aware that people are getting the payment based on what they earned before the restrictions came in.  Now we can see there is an argument for tapering the PUP.  If a person who is currently on &euro;250 or &euro;300 works in the restaurant or broader hospitality sector and is brought back for outdoor service but on fewer hours, such as for ten hours per week, and will only get &euro;100, that person would be down by &euro;100 or &euro;150.  There is an argument for tapering the PUP to cater for those workers so that they do not find themselves on probably half what they received on the PUP, which was calculated on the basis of their previous wages.  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that issue.  Is she considering it?<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I intended to ask have been covered and I will not repeat them.  I refer to workers who were on the temporary Covid-19 wage support scheme, TWSS, payment from March to September last year.  All present know why the scheme was brought in and I am not in any way arguing that it was a negative payment.  It kept workers employed and it assisted employers whose turnover was down by 25% or more.  However, I refer to the workers who worked right through the pandemic, such as pharmacy employees and many thousands of other workers.<\/p><p>They found they had to pay tax on the TWSS payment.  The workers see that as a cut in their wages because the basis of the payment, as arranged by the Government and the Revenue Commissioners, was that the employer would not have to return the PRSI or tax payment, such that the worker would get paid his or her net pay.  Owing to that, workers found themselves paying tax on their net pay.  Essentially, it was a cut in the wages of the workers and they are very aggrieved by it.  This matter has not been given the airing it should have been given from the point of view of the workers.  What is the Minister's opinion on that?  Should the workers be in this situation?<\/p><p> Is the Minister considering introducing paid miscarriage leave at any point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#D00200","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins.

I will raise that with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  The rule is that if in any one year one earns a certain amount of income, regardless of the source, income tax has to be paid on it.  That is the way it works but I will raise it with the Minister.<\/p> <p>  We review issues such as paid leave for those who have had a miscarriage.

I wish the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na well.<\/p> <p>  On the Estimates, I pay tribute to the Minister and her officials for responding comprehensively to the huge challenge presented by Covid.  I welcome the Minister's comment that a decision will be made on the PUP and wage subsidy schemes in early June.  We need clarity in this regard.  Certain sectors, including aviation, hospitality and tourism, have been affected more than others.  These sectors are major contributors to our economy and employ hundreds of thousands of people.  There is a strong argument to be made for extending the supports for the sectors until the end of this year and even into next year.  I encourage the Minister to give strong consideration to that proposal with her Government colleagues.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of points to make.  I acknowledge the Minister has been working to try to resolve the issues concerning community employment, CE, supervisors.  She has been engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in this regard.  Could she update the committee on the position on finding a resolution to the long-standing issue?  Every member of this committee will be very familiar with the case.  There were hopes that it could be resolved in the immediate term.  I hope the Minister will have positive news about it.<\/p> <p>  I have received queries on the payment for people who retire at 65.  The Minister will be aware that there are many companies in the Clare area, including the Shannon area, that employ a lot of people.  Over the years, certain people retired at 60 but they are not deemed eligible for the new payment that was introduced.  I have dealt with the case of a man who was 60 when he retired.  He worked for 41 years and made all the relevant contributions but appears to be 13 contributions short and is not deemed eligible for the new payment that was introduced.  This is grossly unfair.  I ask the Minister to examine the circumstances.  Again, I thank her for her attendance at this committee and for her positive engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#E00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carey for raising these issues.  I thank him for his comments on the bravery of the garda&iacute; last night.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, we have supported many people through the PUP, with total expenditure to date amounting to &euro;7.75 billion.  We are considering the future of the payment.  It is the role of the social protection system to provide a basic income.  With regard to sector-specific measures, we need to take the point up with the Ministers with responsibility for the relevant sectors.  The social protection system has never paid sector-specific payments because it gets very complicated and it is probably unworkable.  For example, where does one draw the line between a painter or electrician on a film set in the arts sector and a painter or electrician on a building site?  Many supports have been given to the music, entertainment and arts sectors through the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has provided a broad range of supports for the business sector.  Therefore, there are sector-specific supports within each Department.<\/p> <p>  We have been working with CE supervisors and have had discussions with them.  For several years, they have been requesting, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue relating solely to the CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendations.  The Deputy can appreciate that.  Any proposals to resolve this specific issue can and will only apply to CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.  We have been working closely with the relevant Department and we have made a proposal.  The proposal was sent to the unions representing the CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.  The unions had a few queries and we have reverted to them with the answers.  We are engaging with the unions on this basis.  I hope we will find a resolution very quickly.  The process is at an advanced stage.  Any settlement arising will apply only to those parties who were the subject of the 2008 Labour Court recommendation and the related discussions with the Department, that is, the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.<\/p><p>I am confident that we have a solid basis for progressing and resolving this issue while not exposing the Exchequer to any additional costs.  That is the position as it stands.  As I have said, I hope we will get this long-standing issue resolved fairly soon.<\/p><p> Regarding the payment for the 65-year-olds, the Deputy will remember that, before we brought in this payment, people who had to retire at 65 had to come in and fill out a form.  This was the issue which was raised with me at the time.  I saw it myself.  They had to fill out applications for jobseeker's payments.  These were people who had worked all of their lives but who had to retire at the age of 65 because of their contracts.  They had to sign on and to present and say that they were available for work.  I felt that was wrong.  That is why we brought in the retirement payment for 65-year-olds.  Originally, this could be claimed for nine months, depending on one's contributions.  We then made it available for the full year but it only applied to people who retired at the age of 65.  It remains in place.  People do not have to sign on or attend an Intreo centre.  The social insurance contribution requirements are not as high as those for State pension eligibility.  Given that they have a recent attachment to the workforce, people retiring at 65 should, in most cases, meet the PRSI requirements.  One has to have been working at the age of 65 to get it.  That is part of it.  Unfortunately, the particular person Deputy Carey mentioned would not seem to qualify but, if the Deputy wishes to provide me with the details, I am happy to take a look at the case. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#E00400","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the report.

I have a number of general questions but, in this round, I will focus on more specific questions arising from the Revised Estimate.<\/p> <p>  With regard to live register figures and their interface with the PUP, do we have figures as to the number of people who transition from the PUP to jobseeker's payments?  If we have such figures, what do they imply?  If people chose to make that transition, it obviously shows that they decided they would be better off having done so.  <\/p> <p>  What do we know about people on the PUP?  Are we gathering that type of information?  Do we know their living arrangements, their total household income or whether they are students or people who were formerly employed?  This will obviously become a huge data set in the future.  It would be very useful to have that level of information so that we can know what sectors are most liable to this type of shock.  It would set a context for the continuing work in the Government with regard to universal basic income and for the way in which we set our basic welfare rates.  What information is the Department gathering in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the significant increase in funding for school meals, 21.8% or &euro;65 million.  What metrics are we using to measure efficacy?  Are we just talking about the number of meals on tables or the amount of money or are we looking at other ways of defining our success?  Are we looking at the nutritional quality of the meals being delivered, for example?  Are we looking at the social outcomes of children getting to sit together with a hot school meal?  I am interested in the metrics used in this regard.<\/p> <p>  A very small scheme which jumped out at me is the experience year Europe, EYE, scheme.  This caught my eye, and I am not going to apologise for the pun.  Funding for this has increased slightly.  It is a very interesting scheme for us.  We know that young people suffered disproportionately during the lockdowns.  It would be nice to see a pandemic divided for them, perhaps through a scheme like this which would support them in a European experience.  It is a very welcome scheme.  Would the Minister like to comment on that?<\/p> <p>  There is a line item for miscellaneous services.  Some &euro;17.8 million was provided for this in the Revised Estimates for 2021 and the outturn was &euro;13.3 million.  In this year's Revised Estimate, the provision is back up to &euro;20 million.  What is funded under this line item?  If the outturn was significantly below the Estimate provided last year, are we confident that the money will be spent this year? <\/p> <p>  I apologise that I am taking somewhat of a scattergun approach and jumping around.  Under administration, there is a heading for travel and subsistence which again shows the same pattern.  It was approximately &euro;5 million in the Revised Estimate for 2020 while the outturn was only &euro;1.5 million.  We can all understand why spending on travel and subsistence would be lower last year but in this year's Revised Estimate, the provision is back up to &euro;4.155 million.  Are we envisaging a return to business as usual?  Is there not an opportunity to bring this spending down now that we are all much more used to remote working?<\/p> <p>  I have two other specific matters to raise.  Some &euro;18.6 million is allocated for other working-age supports.  This may be a small figure within the overall context of the budget but does the Minister have additional details on this?  In a similar vein, spending on the working-age employment support scheme is up 174%.  There are ten smaller employment support schemes.  We all understand the need to resource employment supports in the coming year, but will the Minister supply further details on this?  The last matter I will raise in my scattergun approach is that there is an increase of &euro;3.6 million in spending on eGovernment-related projects.  I would not question this level of funding.  In fact, I would imagine there is scope to increase it.  Will the Minister provide some further detail on this?  I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#F00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>The Vice Chairman has asked me a number of questions.  I will try to answer them.  With regard to the PUP, we have collected a lot of data on the numbers in receipt of the payment.  I do not have it to hand, but I have asked my officials for a breakdown with particular regard to those who have been on the PUP for the long term, that is, those who have been on it since last March, because we want to see the sectors affected and how we can get people back to work again.<\/p><p>I will launch a pathways to work strategy in early June that will look at all the different supports we can give people to help them find employment.  This could mean we need to retrain or upskill so there are a number of apprenticeship schemes and we are looking at a work placement support system.  The main thing we want to do is help people find new jobs.  Some may not go back to the jobs they had previously so we want to give them that support and confidence.  This is also important because I speak to people, including older people and people who have been out of work for a long time, who will need confidence building because they have been at home or have not been out there in the workplace.  We have all been out working and it is easier for us but for those who have not been, it is about giving them the support they will need to go back into the workplace.  That is what the pathways to work programme will help to address.  <br\/><br\/>I am particularly conscious of young people.  We maintained the PUP for students.  I was very strong in respect of doing this because I felt students lost their jobs in the same way as everybody did when this pandemic hit.  We have continued to make the payment to them.  Thankfully, as the economy reopens, we can look to a brighter future.  I know there are a lot of young people who are just dying to get back to work and want to get out, meet their friends and return to normality.  I expect that as the economy opens further, we will see a lot of people who will take up employment and return to work.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of miscellaneous services, that expenditure includes <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments to women from the Magdalen laundries and other institutions, a small rent allowance scheme for people affected by the de-control of rents and information grants.  The food aid programme under the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived is also included.  The provision for miscellaneous services in 2021 is &euro;20.9 million.  When we were putting together budget 2021, we expected that the economy would reopen.  None of us thought we would be in lockdown in January so the figures were produced on the basis that life would start to return to normality but that did not happen, which is why in respect of a lot of the figures referred to by the Vice Chairman, there was an underspend in 2020 and an anticipated increase in expenditure for 2021.  <br\/><br\/>I think I have covered most points.  Other employment supports include an enterprise support grant, which aims to get people back to work; a training support grant; a credit union loan guarantee where we help people when they need to take out a loan; a part-time job initiative; an activation and family support project; and payments to long-term unemployed and lone parents.  There are a number of different things.  These are all working-age employment supports.  I can get the Vice Chairman more details on that.  Regarding e-government expenditure, it is necessary because we are investing in online and digital services.  The experience of the pandemic has shown that many customers want to interact with us digitally.  We all know that ourselves.  We are doing our banking over the phone and want to be able to interact with Government services digitally.  <br\/><br\/>I hope I have answered all the Vice Chairman's questions.  The school meals programme has been a great pilot.  I have increased it this year.  My view is that it is hard to beat a hot meal in the middle of the day for schoolchildren.  I am very supportive of that.  We will carry out a review of it because the Vice Chairman is right.  We want to make sure we are not wasting food and that the food has good nutritional value.  I am still of the opinion that a good hot dinner in the middle of the day is great for children.  It helps their concentration and is delivered to them in the schools.  I am a big supporter of that.  We have expanded the pilot scheme and I will continue to review that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#F00500","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I will return to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for a second round of questioning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#G00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I join in the thanks offered to the staff for their fantastic interaction with the public.  The responses we on behalf of the public get as public representatives are prompt and thorough and give one information.  So often nowadays, one gets official replies that say the matter is being considered and there are no timescales.  There is good interaction with the Minister's Department, which is appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I looked at the Estimate regarding T&uacute;s and the community employment, CE.  The Estimate for this year is up but the experience on the ground is down.  I have figures for Connemara.  Between 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2021, the number on T&uacute;s declined by 28% while the number on the CE scheme declined by 9%.  I would love if I could say that unemployment in Connemara had decreased at the time but this was in the middle of the pandemic when more people than ever were on the PUP and standard unemployment payments.  A lot of this is attributable to two things.  The first is people not being referred to these schemes because a hold back by the JobPath programme where people who are very unlikely to get employment are not able to access these schemes because they must go through a whole process with JobPath first.  The second issue is that there are unnecessary limits to how long someone can spend on these schemes.  I have never seen the rationale for pulling people off schemes and putting them back on to means-tested social welfare payments.  It is demoralising when people do not have the opportunity to get up in the morning, go into work, socialise and make a contribution.  It is an urban upper middle-class myth that people who get good employment in the commercial economy will be happy on a CE or T&uacute;s scheme.  The idea that if we allow them to stay on longer, it might disincentivise them from being activated is an urban myth.  It is not my experience of real people on the ground.  Will the Minister look at the length of time people can stay on these schemes, particularly on T&uacute;s because CE is more expensive and involves training?  It concerns whether after a number of years when a person has done all the training, that will make any difference in terms of activation.  What the person needs is a job or somewhere to work and make a contribution to the community.  This issue needs to be tackled.  Unless Connemara is unique, I would be very surprised if at the end of the year, the Department spends its budget here.  <\/p> <p>  There was a discussion earlier about pensions for CE supervisors.  I welcome the progress being made and hope this matter can be brought to a resolution and that the discussions lead to a good outcome.  However, the Minister knows that it is a bit disconcerting when people say that rural social scheme and T&uacute;s supervisors will be treated in a totally different manner.  I expect that what will happen here is that we say that they are similar schemes and should be included in this package.  What discussions are taking place based on the reality?  Sometimes we deny realities that are inevitable rather than getting on and doing the thing that will have to be done and that is right to do.<\/p><p> At the end of the year, there is a projected figure of 395,000 unemployed.  I find that a little surprising.  One would have hoped that by autumn, every adult in the country who wants it would have been vaccinated.  Obviously a small number will opt not to have one.  I am surprised the projected figure for unemployment is that high.  I would have thought that in some sectors of hospitality, because people had been deprived of going out, they would be even keener to go out.  I understand big indoor events in particular, concerts and so on, would be more difficult, but there will be other sectors of hospitality that would be even stronger than ever, with people taking staycations and so on.  I accept aviation would be down, but looking at it sector by sector, I am surprised the projected figure is that high.  On what is it based?<\/p><p> The PUP has three rates of payment.  One is the exact same as jobseeker's allowance.  How many people are on the three rates?  It is one thing to say there are 345,000 on PUP but a breakdown would be interesting.  How many are on the &euro;203 rate, the medium and the high rates?  That would be useful to us when thinking about this issue and in future debates on how we find a way forward from where we are.  I welcome the Minister saying there can be absolutely no cliff edge.  It would be useful for us to know how many people are at the different cliff faces, the high one and the very low one.<\/p><p> I join those who wish well the two garda who were injured last night.  It is horrific that this is happening in the streets of our country.  I would love to see guns out of this society in total.  Guns and criminality are a huge challenge we face.  We must all work to ensure we not only deal with the actual criminals but also with the underlying social issues that, unfortunately, breed antisocial and criminal behaviour.  We have a huge job to do in early diversion of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#G00300","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  That is exactly why it is so important we invest in our young people and give them the supports they need to find employment and show them there are better ways.  That is something this Government is committed to - to helping our young people in every way we can.<\/p><p>There were a lot of questions there.  One was on the pensions for CE supervisors and why we cannot extend it to T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme supervisors.  All these schemes are delivered by independent bodies.  The promoters of the schemes are funded by my Department.  While it provides funding for participant and supervisors payroll, the Department is not the employer of any scheme participants or their participants.  We need to be clear on that.<\/p><p>Community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors have for some time been seeking the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation that specifically related to a pension scheme for community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  It is within this context that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors held discussions on proposals to progress this issue.  These discussions were held on the clear agreement by all involved that they related solely to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and I recently reached agreement in principle to try and resolve the issue.  It has gone to the unions and I hope we will have a resolution in due course.<\/p><p>We have increased the numbers on CE schemes as part of the July stimulus package.  We announced an additional 3,000 places.  Unfortunately, the lockdown meant some schemes were impacted by restrictions.  There are 1,760 vacancies on community employment and 1,458 on T&uacute;s schemes.  The community employment sponsoring authorities are encouraged by my officials to promote awareness of the benefits of community employment in local communities and to advertise their vacancies on the Department's recruitment portal <i>www.jobsireland.ie<\/i>.  I take the Deputy's point about the length of time people are on these schemes.  CE schemes provide two services: job activation and a social service.  Until we recognise that, we will always have these problems where people want to stay on, they reach a certain age, and if they get another six months on the CE scheme, they might be due to retire.  It is either that or they might get another two years.  We have to recognise that.<\/p><p>I have met with a number of the CE supervisors and listened to their concerns.  A report was done and it said you are stigmatising people if you put them in the category where they can stay on and you do not expect them ever to work again.  On the other hand, there are those who want to stay on and who are doing really valuable work in their communities.  If those services they provide were not available, there would be a gaping hole and somebody would have to provide them.  There is a further conversation we have to have on CE schemes and I am prepared to have it.  I am clear we need to look at it from the perspective that it is a job activation measure and does really good work in that.  Many young people come in, get the work experience and training, and then get jobs.  That is what it is meant to do, but there is also the social side to it.  I am happy to work with the committee on that because it is something I feel strongly about.<\/p><p>As I said, there were a number of measures in the July stimulus to get people back to work, many of which we could not activate because the economy was closed down.  We will be getting these back up and running and they will form part of the Pathways to Work strategy.  I have been talking to the labour market advisory council which has given us good advice on how we go forward.<\/p><p>On PUP rates, 45% in receipt of the payment are on &euro;350, 18% are on &euro;300, 17% on &euro;250 and 20% are on &euro;203.  The vast majority on the PUP are higher earners.  The Deputy mentioned our projection of 395,000 unemployed.  They are all projections and it is hoped the numbers will reduce, but we have figures to back up the projections.  The unemployment numbers in the Revised Estimate are based on the assumptions of rates and numbers of unemployed used by the Department of Finance in the development of the stability programme update which was published in April 2021.  The stability programme update assumed that the quarterly unemployment rates would be 24.4% in quarter 1, reducing to 11.2% by quarter 2.<\/p><p>The numbers range from 592,000 in quarter 1 to the actual number of those on the live register plus the pandemic unemployment payment recipients, which was 273,000 by the year end.  As Deputies are aware, we are constantly monitoring projected unemployment.  The latest Central Statistics Office data for April 2021 recorded a Covid-19 adjusted overall unemployment rate of 22.4%.  This includes all those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  The traditional International Labour Office level of unemployment is 5.6%.  Neither of these is likely to represent the true underlying level of unemployment.  It is likely to lie between the two estimates.<\/p><p> The quicker the economy gets opened up, the better the position we will be in to beat the figures.  We have said we will get more people back to work.  The roll-out of the vaccine programme has been successful.  As the Deputy said, the vaccine has been rolled out and we want to get more people back.  People want to get back to normality and get back to the workplace and to social interaction.  We want to support them to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#H00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I have one eye on the clock.

I want to come back on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  I take the point made by the Minister that people pay tax on their income.  However, the scheme was brought in under extraordinary circumstances.  There must have been an arrangement between the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to forfeit the original tax that would have been due on the gross pay of those workers.  There was an arrangement to forfeit PAYE tax at that point.  Many workers did not realise they were on the temporary wage subsidy scheme because they were getting net pay and their employers did not have to inform them.  We know that thousands of employers availed of the scheme.  Therefore, thousands of workers were affected by it.<\/p> <p>  The idea of taxing those workers under an extraordinary scheme brought in on net pay has to be reviewed.  Under the initial scheme the Government was able to forfeit tax on gross pay.  It should be able to forfeit tax on net pay.  Effectively, these workers are taking a cut in their wages.  That has to be looked at by the Government from the point of view of these workers.  These workers were going into work.  It was the first phase of the restrictions.  They had no idea what was going to happen.  They were afraid of their lives.  This was especially the case for pharmacy workers who would have gone back to their families thinking they were probably bringing home the virus and so on.  Given the extraordinary circumstances we were dealing with in respect of the scheme, the Government should look at the impact it had and the unintended consequences for those workers in taking a pay cut.  I will leave it at that and ask the Minister to look at it again from that point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#J00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I take the point the Deputy is making.

However, I take the point the Deputy is making for those who could not afford to do that.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, tax issues are a matter for the Department of Finance and Revenue.  We are the administrators and it came out of our budget, but tax issues are a matter for the Department of Finance and Revenue.  It is underpinned by legislation.

I will begin with two of the measures announced by the Minister in the July stimulus plan, namely, the work placement experience programme and the JobsPlus programme.  The Minister touched on this already.  How are we doing in terms of take-up?  Are we getting the employers?  It has been a difficult context to roll out those schemes.  Are we hitting targets?  Are we getting anywhere close?  What are the sectors where we are seeing deployment?<\/p> <p>  Young people have been mentioned repeatedly.  That is appropriate and I will mention them again.  We know they have been disproportionately affected by the contraction in the labour market.  It has been very much in hospitality and so on.  They will now face a reduction from the pandemic unemployment payment to a lower level of jobseeker's allowance, especially for people under 25 years of age.  I am concerned this will affect young people with lower social capital in particular.  They are less likely to be in education and they may now find themselves more distant from the labour market.  Are we specifically planning ahead for how we deal with that so that we do not have young people falling into long-term unemployment?<\/p> <p>  Some issues have been raised with me relating to people whose income dropped during the course of the pandemic.  Maybe they fell behind in their rent or mortgage payments or utilities.  I am concerned we will have an overhang of Covid-19 debt.  People will fall into hardship.  Certainly, we do not want to see people cut off from utilities or losing rented accommodation.  Is there any contingency within the departmental budget to deal with that as we begin to come out of this Covid crisis?  In a more general sense are we beginning to see the new policy direction of this Government and Department reflected in the figures?<\/p><p>I think it was Joe Biden who said: \"Don't tell me what you value; show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.\"  Are we beginning to see that support for lone parents, the cohort most likely to be affected by issues such as deprivation or isolation?  There are very ambitious targets in regard to consistent poverty of about 2%.  Are we beginning to see forward planning on the Department's part in regard to how we will achieve this, not just in this budget but over the lifetime of the Government?<\/p><p> We always talk about base rates in absolute terms and cash figures, whether that is the &euro;5 increase in the pension or whatever it is.  That tends to apply to both pensions and jobseeker's payments.  Has the Department considered the potential benefit of benchmarking payments against other measures, such as the cost of living or as a percentage of the average industrial wage?  Are we considering different ideas for how we measure these payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#J00700","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I am very conscious that we need to support young people and that is why we have all these programmes, including the EmployAbility service, that target young people who have difficulties getting back into the workplace.  I met representatives of EmployAbility on Monday and they explained to me how when young people come in to the service, they are placed with an employer and sometimes there are problems.  A typical example could be if somebody is suffering from an addiction and is trying to go to work.  He or she might then miss an appointment with the addiction support service and slip back, and then the employer wonders why the person is not at work.  When there is somebody who can connect and address those issues, there is a better chance of resolving it.  The employer can give the employee time off to attend the service and there will be a better outcome.  I am very conscious that we must provide those services for people who need to get back to work, and particularly young people.<\/p> <p>  There are some figures regarding youth unemployment.  At present, approximately 43,000 PUP recipients are students, 90% of whom are under 25 years of age.  Using the international definition of unemployment set in the International Labour Organization, students are generally not counted as unemployed as they are not considered part of the labour force because they are in education.  Therefore, the inclusion of students has inflated the Covid-19-adjusted measure of youth unemployment.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I am not taking away from the fact that we need to focus on getting our young people into work and skilling them.  There are many jobs out there at the moment but some of them do not have those skills, so our further and higher education system is important.  As the committee will be aware, the Minister with responsibility for that matter, Deputy Harris, has launched a new apprenticeship scheme and a number of supports are available in that regard to reskill and upskill, and to take on the jobs of the future.  I am familiar with a number of projects from my time as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation where the focus has to go on industry 4.0.  We have to train people.  While it may still be on the factory floor, it will be about telling the robots what they have to do.  Many young people are very interested in programming and so on, and we have to capture their imagination, look to the future and use technology in every way we can.<\/p> <p>  The Vice Chairman mentioned the work placement experience programme and a number of other programmes we launched in the July stimulus package last year.  Unfortunately, we were not able to launch some of them because the economy was closed and the jobs were not there.  I will announce the pathways to work early next month and it will certainly be a case of all hands on deck.  Every effort will be made to maximise the take-up of all the supports out there.<\/p> <p>  In recent budgets, we have targeted resources at those at most risk of poverty.  In the most recent budget, the employment income limit of &euro;425 was removed from the working lone parent benefit.  We increased the qualified child allowance by &euro;5 a week for children aged 12 and over and &euro;2 a week for children up to age 12, while for pensioners and people with disabilities, we increased the living alone allowance.  There a number of other supports we provided in the previous budget.  It was targeted at those who needed it most and we wanted to help those most in need.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the indexation of pensions, as a first step the Department undertook a consultation process with a number of interested stakeholders throughout 2019 to hear their views.  The outcome of these discussions was considered and, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department has developed proposals for setting a formal benchmark for contributory State pension payments.  The roadmap for social inclusion outlines the potential approach currently under consideration, using what can be described as a smooth earning system that ensures that, over the long term, the relative value of welfare payments compared with market earnings will be maintained and, over any short-term period, the real value or purchasing power of these payments will be protected.  I have asked my officials to continue to engage with their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to progressing this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021052600002#K00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>On metrics and how the Department measures the success of our welfare system, we measure issues such as workforce participation, deprivation and consistent poverty.  I have one eye to the work being done by the Government on the well-being indices, which is under way.  Are there other measures we use in regard to our social welfare outputs, such as well-being?  Do we have health outcome data on the effects of reducing poverty in certain cohorts?  One issue that has come home to me over the course of the pandemic in particular, although I am sure it applies at all times, relates to subjective measures of community participation or people experiencing loneliness, for example.  Some people question the merit of subjective measures but I think they are important and they have a role to play.  The Department is probably uniquely positioned to gather such data on people living alone, for example.<\/p> <p>  Has the Department begun work to evaluate our Covid response in the context of key policy outcomes?  I refer to lone parents and how difficult they must have found the period of home-schooling in particular.

The pilot was relatively successful in pushing for equality considerations.  In 2019, the OECD was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the then Department of Justice and Equality to conduct a review of Ireland's approach to equality budgeting, both to accelerate the uptake and impact of the initiative and to take account of developments.

The network will also facilitate cross-Government training on the purpose and application of equality budgeting.  The interdepartmental group will include a senior member of staff from each Department, with each member having a broad knowledge of the policy work undertaken by his or her Department and its relevance to advancing the goals of equality and inclusion.  This network will help inform the future direction of equality budgeting policy in line with the provision of a distributional overview by income decile and household type.

In our first session, we will meet representatives from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  The witnesses will be joining us remotely.  Unfortunately, that is how matters must be at the moment, but it is still good.  I welcome Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, the chief commissioner of IHREC, and her commission colleague, Dr. Lucy Michael.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite witnesses to make opening statements, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before I invite them to deliver their opening statements, I remind them they have three minutes to do so.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the position on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if the statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory of any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with such directions.  I have no doubt this situation will not occur.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to participate in our public meeting.  I will not permit members to attend unless they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I ask that members identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the debates office staff preparing the Official Report and to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask that members use the raise hand button when they want to contribute.  I also ask everyone joining today's meeting to ensure all mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms Gibney to make her opening statement on behalf of IHREC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#A00500","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, I thank the committee.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is Ireland's independent national human rights institution and equality body.  In this role, we hold a specific mandate to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice relating to the protection of human rights and equality, and to examine any legislative proposal and report our views on any implication it has for human rights or equality.<\/p> <p>  Our written contribution, already provided to members, focuses on a number of specific issues, primarily the role and functions of the media commission, the definition of \"harmful online content\" and \"age appropriate content\", and the accessibility of services for people with disabilities.  Most fundamentally, we are clear that any proposed legislation must satisfy the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality.<\/p> <p>  There can be no doubt this is significant legislation from a human rights and equality perspective and that it can be strengthened through stronger and more consistent reference to human rights and equality standards.  Protecting people from online harmful content and conduct is a requirement under international human rights law, but it is necessary that such measures be balanced against competing fundamental rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, privacy and freedom of assembly.<\/p> <p>  We have covered the issue of disability access, informed by the work of our disability advisory committee and our role as the independent monitor of Ireland's compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.  However, we strongly recommend that, on issues of disability access and in line with the CRPD principles, the committee invite disabled people's organisations to speak to it about their direct experience and understanding.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the establishment of a media commission, it is important this legislation includes a specific statutory requirement for the commission to have due regard in the performance of its functions to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights.  This requirement is one incumbent upon all public bodies as part of the public sector equality and human rights duty.  Given the breadth of responsibility of the new commission, though, an explicit statement of this obligation is an important addition.<\/p> <p>  Legal definitions of concepts that are central to the effectiveness of this law in practice need to be articulated more explicitly.  For example, the definition of \"harmful online content\" needs to be clear and sufficiently precise.  Terms relating to hate speech, such as racism, sexism, and ableism, should also be clearly defined under the proposed legislation.  I will invite Dr. Michael to contribute during this part of our discussion.<\/p> <p>  We would further question why the definition of online harm does not include material that violates other legal regimes, for example, defamation law, data protection, privacy law, consumer protection law or copyright law.  The fact a statement is defamatory or in breach of data protection or copyright law does not necessarily mean it may not also be a form of harmful online content.  This clarity is in the interest of delineating freedom of speech as well as providing adequate protection for affected groups.<\/p> <p>  For these and other reasons, we are clear the Bill is sorely needed, but it must be designed and defined in ways that make it truly effective, and it cannot be a stand-alone measure.  Legislatively, it must fit hand in glove with the draft hate crime legislation that is also being prepared by the Houses and combine effectively with the eventual publication of a national action plan against racism.<\/p> <p>  Beyond legislation, to ensure an overarching, effective and human rights-compliant framework for online safety, media regulation and tackling hate speech and hate crime, there must be a broader societal conversation beyond criminalisation and prohibition, one that includes education, counter-speech and the promotion of pluralism.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Michael and I are happy to take members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gibney for her detailed presentation.

That ongoing participation should be baked into the commission.  Ultimately, we would advise that the commission should be a diverse representation of Irish society.  Like our organisation, membership of the commission could have the lived experience of disability within its ranks.  Engagement and participation should be an ongoing function of the commission.

I am conscious that Ms Gibney was before the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU on Monday.  It has been a busy week for her before the Oireachtas committees.  I agree with Deputy Munster&rsquo;s point about some of the disability organisations.<\/p> <p>  I will ask about two specific issues.  The first, which has been raised with us by a number of organisations, is the question of whether to have an individual complaints mechanism.  Questions arise with regard to human rights and equality, particularly in respect of broadcasters and tech giants.  Some of the actions of these organisations are allegedly in breach of some of the protections in the proposed Bill.  How would IHREC see that operating?  What mechanism would it like to see in place with the new media commission?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to algorithmic decision-making.  I take a particularly strong position on this issue.  We need to have a code that will ensure that any organisation, be it a State organisation or private business, that uses algorithms to make decisions will be audited and that there are guards against bias.  It is particularly crucial against the nine equality headings that we have that in place.  This is going to be a big issue.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views on how they would see that operating.  It is certainly our intention that there will be a code.  I want a guarantee that any organisation that uses an algorithm to make a decision will be audited.  I would be grateful to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#B00700","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  It is good to see him twice in the same week.  On the question of individual complaints, we did not go into detail on this issue in our submission.  However, I would be more than happy to engage in further scrutiny of this.  I will give my response to the question today.<\/p> <p>  We want to see more detail on the super-complaints mechanism proposal.  That would be welcome.  I listened back to some of the contributions to the committee from both rights groups and tech companies.  There has to be better transparency around the handling of individual complaints.  There has to be a move away from the obligation on the individual, rather than on the tech or online platforms, in determining the harmful content.  This is an example of where there has to be an inclusive approach.  The tech companies have expertise to help address this issue.  A body or commission like this has the potential to bring together the different actors within this State and provide leadership across Europe in finding a resolution to this issue.  This is an example of the kind of issue where we can bring those groups together to deal with it.  This is not something we can do without co-operation among the different actors involved.  The tech companies will play an important role in resolving this and their expertise will be needed to do so.<\/p> <p>  I know there are issues around speed of take-down and the ownership piece.  First and foremost, there has to be transparency within the Bill.  To go back to what we are putting forward most strongly around legality, proportionality and appropriateness, if those concepts inform the design of this law and the commission, the committee will, I believe, come up with appropriate solutions.<\/p> <p>  I would be more than happy for our team to go into more detail on that element of the Bill.  The legislation is so wide-ranging that we were only able to go into certain areas of it in our initial submission.<\/p> <p>  On algorithmic decision-making, the Senator will see that we have encouraged the incorporation in the legislation not only of content but also of conduct.  That would deal with the particular issues to which he alluded.  We saw the first example of that essentially in the predicted grades last year.  That will definitely be a huge issue as more artificial intelligence, AI, is used across the public and private sectors.  It is critical that is incorporated.

The most important feature of how the commission is set up is that it is independent and it is able to execute its functions within that independence.  As the head of a State agency that enjoys that independence, and IHREC is arguably one of most independent agencies within the State, I can tell the committee that the future media commissioner will thank it for considering this in the drafting of this legislation.  The specifics of our recommendation on this are around the budget itself, which should be a separate Vote account, and the removal of the capacity for the Minister or the Department to remove individual commissioners because that is problematic.  What is most important is that, as a regulatory body, the commission has the discretion and independence to operate as it needs to.  To elaborate on that, the need for that is down to the fact we are engaging rights which are core, fundamental rights, namely, the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and privacy.  While interference with those rights is required in this instance, and I think everyone can agree with that, that interference should be allowed to happen with full independence and without any undue influence from Government.  That is why we have chosen to emphasise this piece within it.  We, as a body enjoying similar regulatory functions, have a lot of sympathy for that.<\/p> <p>  Maybe I will hand over to Dr. Michael to discuss hate speech.

I will try to be brief.  Hate speech is a term that causes much confusion among policymakers and legislators as well as the public.  Certainly in terms of this legislation, I would be very cautious about ensuring it was well defined.  This legislation must be carefully aligned with the hate crime and hate speech Bill that is coming forward.  We know many people need a little more education and awareness on what hate speech is in this context.  Only the most extreme instances of hate speech are criminalised, and the European Court of Human Rights and the charter both recognise there are limitations on free speech and those should be for particular purposes.  If a state does not criminalise certain hate speech, then it must regulate it in some way, and that is where this Bill comes in.  The implementation without gaps of hate speech legislation in such a way that it protects both those who are targeted by hate speech and freedom of expression for them and everybody else means we need that careful definition and alignment.  Therefore, in creating the media commission and those involved in creating further codes, toolkits and guides going forward, a careful definition now, along with a mechanism to ensure that is kept up to date and in alignment with other legislation is crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lucy Michael"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>We have not gone into detail on this, so perhaps this is another one I can add to in any further scrutiny we might provide in future around private communications.

In terms of the set-up, those are the two key pieces we recommend but the make-up of the commission itself should be considered.  Speaking as the chief commissioner of a group of 15 people who do represent the diversity of society, we have a legislative mandate to have gender equality within the commission and that representation only strengthens our organisation.  For such an organisation as the media commission, which impacts so strongly on the rights and equality of rights of individuals, to have that same level of representation would be very strong.  Added to that should be the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and rights.  Those are some things we feel would be important for that.  Like I said at the outset, that is within the 2014 IHREC Act, something this body would most likely be subject to anyway, but given the significant impact this would have on rights and equality, we believe being more explicit in the drafting of the legislation, giving it that legislative footing, will strengthen that positive obligation on this body.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Michael might want to elaborate further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#C01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>To elaborate on what Ms Gibney is saying, it is important to say much of this legislation, both this Bill and others coming through this year, are about restoring public trust in the face of online harm and disinformation.

Colleagues and our guests are very welcome.  We are joined by representatives of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Digital Rights Ireland to discuss the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  I welcome the following witnesses who will be joining us virtually via Microsoft Teams: Mr. Liam Herrick, executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL; his colleague, Ms Olga Cronin, policy officer on surveillance and human rights; and Dr. T.J. McIntyre, chair of Digital Rights Ireland.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make opening statements, to be followed by questions from members.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  I will first call the representatives of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to deliver their opening statement, to be followed by Digital Rights Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes per organisation, I advise them of the following in terms of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if the statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory of any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with such directions.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  I ask those participating in the meeting to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the debates office staff preparing the Official Report and I ask them to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I remind members to keep their mobile phones switched off or on silent mode.<\/p> <p>  With that housekeeping out of the way, I am delighted to get to the crux of the meeting, which is the presentations by our guests.  I invite Mr. Herrick to make his opening statement on behalf of ICCL.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#E00100","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, of which I am executive director, is very grateful to the committee for this opportunity to appear.  The committee has received our opening statement.  The ICCL is an independent NGO which works to promote and protect human rights in Ireland.  We do not represent particular groups but, rather, work to ensure the Government fulfils its human rights obligations in all relevant law and policy.<\/p> <p>  In our submission to the committee, we analysed the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill in light of Ireland&rsquo;s human rights obligations.  We specifically considered the Bill in respect of the right to freedom of expression, the right to send and receive information and the right to privacy and private communications.  Having analysed the scheme of the Bill, the ICCL is concerned that aspects of what is proposed are overly vague and poorly defined to the point that it is wholly unclear who can expect to be regulated by the proposed media commission and when and how.<\/p> <p>  We have the following main concerns.  There is a troubling vagueness in the context of the definition of what might constitute harmful online content under head 49A of the Bill.  The ICCL is concerned about what this vagueness may mean for legal accessibility, foreseeability and the safeguarding of the right to freedom of expression and communication, as well as the potential chilling effect that may result from this vagueness in the context of self-censorship and in the internal workings of platforms and technology companies.  The ICCL accepts the legitimate and important intention on the part of the Department in bringing this forward to reduce the hurt that children and adults may feel because of material online.  However, there is a danger that in passing this legislation in the manner proposed, the issuing of notices for the removal of content which, for example, could be deemed likely to cause someone else to feel humiliated is a threshold so low that it could seriously damage individuals&rsquo; constitutional rights to freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, there is troubling vagueness in terms of what online services may be deemed a designated online service by the commission.  We particularly endorse the submission by our colleagues in Digital Rights Ireland to that effect.  There is an assumption that by defining content, the intention of the Bill is to engage with commercial operations of large technology companies.  However, this vague definition has the potential to capture a much wider range of online services, the operators of which will be subjected to as yet unwritten regulator codes.  What we do know is that these designated services will be chosen at will by the commission from a plethora of services that have one thing in common, namely, facilitating the dissemination of content.  The scheme tells us that this will cover online services that might include social media services, public boards and forums, online gaming services, e-commerce services, private communications services, online cloud storage services, press publications and so on.  It is a vast and potentially unlimited list.<\/p> <p>  The Bill fails to provide for the actual role of the online safety commissioner and, as a consequence, it fails to specify the specific functions of the commissioner in the wider media commission.  We understand this is essentially a technical drafting issue.<\/p> <p>  There is a common purpose between the intention of the drafting and what all present wish to see, that is, a well-defined body, but it needs further work, perhaps on Committee Stage.  We endorse the submissions of bodies such as the Law Society and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission with regard to ensuring gender diversity and wider diversity principles in the membership of the commission.<\/p><p>As it stands, we believe this Bill will provide for the regulation of conversations that are had online.  It will see words written by members of the public subjected to codes via service operators, even though members of the public do not make up a licensed body.  The enforcement of State codes of conduct against members of the public for non-illegal behaviour creates serious problems with respect to fundamental rights.  It is unclear to the ICCL how the commission intends to regulate private conversations which might contain criminal content in a manner which balances the rights to freedom of expression and privacy in communications and respects principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.<\/p><p> The ICCL is supportive of the mechanisms that will provide supplementary routes of redress to victims of crime perpetrated online.  However, we are concerned about the approach being taken and the potential human rights impact of a system designed to restrict speech that is, in and of itself, non-illegal.  Our colleagues in Digital Rights Ireland have raised some interesting points about how one might seek to define what is illegal content in this manner.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick for that comprehensive opening statement.

In our submissions, we focused on several points that have been mentioned by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  We described in some detail why we believe the provisions of the Bill on online safety, which are separate from the requirements of the audiovisual media services directive, are in breach of national and European standards of freedom of expression and privacy.  I am happy to elaborate on this later if the committee wishes.<\/p> <p>  It might be helpful to outline the wider regulatory context.  This Bill has two parts.  Part of it is required under European law to transpose the audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD.  Ireland is long overdue in doing so.  It should have been done by September 2020.  The part relating to online safety goes significantly beyond that.  Much of Part 4 of the heads of the Bill would create a national regime for controlling content typed or spoken, not merely audiovisual content, by individuals on a wide range of platforms, conceivably including private platforms.  It would do so in a way that is essentially unprecedented in Irish or European law.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that this new scheme, by being hitched up to the audiovisual media services directive, might result in this legislation being passed in a way that would not give us time for proper scrutiny.  The problem is that the heads of the Bill in Part 4 merge together the two areas in a way that makes it difficult to disentangle them.  The concerns we and, I believe, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have relate largely to these domestic provisions and innovations.  It would be appropriate to pull out those provisions now, hold them back and consider how they can, as the human rights commission pointed out in the earlier session today, be better aligned with national law in areas such as hate speech and with the forthcoming Digital Services Act from the European Union.  The Digital Services Act is likely to be adopted within the next 18 months to two years.  It will have a significant impact on this area.  It is not clear that the national scheme being proposed in this Bill would be compatible with the Digital Services Act.  It is likely that if we rush to adopt a scheme like this, it will have to be substantially reconfigured at significant cost to the taxpayer and the businesses affected within a short period before Ireland is required to implement the Digital Services Act.<\/p> <p>  As a practical matter, I suggest the appropriate means of handling the concerns expressed by a number of bodies about these aspects of the Bill would be to hold over those aspects, go to further consultation with them and take into account the input of other Departments.  To a large extent, some of these problems relate to the origin of the Bill in a Department which does not have any real experience in regulating the Internet.  It overlooks several significant issues of fundamental rights and Internet law which would probably have been considered had it gone to a fuller consultation more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

The problem is we are trying to take a model which tries to do a few different things.  We are trying to regulate these services and the content produced by individuals on the services as though they were produced by professional organisations in traditional broadcast media.  The audiovisual media services directive is an outgrowth of traditional media regulation.  It takes a regulatory scheme that was designed with traditional media in mind and transposes that to a class of bodies such as video on demand, YouTube etc., and adopts a much narrower set of obligations on the narrower entities that fall within these definitions.  It is not intended to apply across the board to regulation of individual speech.  The problem is that, by bringing in online safety issues more generally, we are taking that narrow, rather intrusive model and expanding it unnecessarily.<\/p> <p>  I will give a concrete example.  The AVMSD is primarily aimed at illegal content.  It deals with harmful content which is accessible by children.  What is proposed is an expansion of this kind of scheme to deal with content which is harmful generally.  We would be moving from regulating what children see to regulating what adults see.

It is an incredibly complex question.  We all accept self-regulation is not satisfactory or ultimately acceptable as a solution to the problem of online harm.  On the other hand, it is doing it without the capacity of the State to regulate in an invasive and comprehensive way the huge volume of material that is produced or regulated by these companies.<\/p><p>One of the interesting models being brought forward by international human rights organisations is the idea of a social media council, which would be an interface between self-regulation moderation in companies and potentially state bodies, such as an online safety or media commission.  Our colleagues in the ARTICLE 19 freedom of expression organisation are exploring the idea of piloting such a model in Ireland.  There is innovative thinking on how we might link the moderation and standards within platforms with a state safety perspective.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked another question about the regulation of private communications that are criminal in content.  As members might hear from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other criminal justice agencies of the State, they are already very much engaged in monitoring criminal activity online and the dissemination of illegal material.  There are international co-operation agreements in place in that regard.  There is much going on in that space already.<\/p><p> There was a question on defining cyberbullying put to Dr. McIntyre a while ago.  It is not for us to come up with a definition but when we look at the detail of what is proposed here, material that might have the effect of being humiliating to another person sets an incredibly low threshold for imposing a strict regulatory imposition on content that might be deemed offensive or humiliating to an adult.  As Dr. McIntyre states, this goes far beyond the idea of regulating illegal content, which was the purpose of the directive.  That is not to say, of course, that we do not all want to take positive action to deal with bullying online.  The idea that this is solely to be achieved through regulation of this type does not fully appreciate the nature of bullying and the wide range of social and psychological factors involved with dealing with that very complex problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  I will push back on some of the assertions made by Mr. Herrick and Dr. McIntyre.  We have accepted that the era of self-regulation by the technology companies is over and I get the point about criminal activity.  Part of our responsibility as legislators, however, is to deal with the very real challenges around online bullying and harassment, and the real harm caused by these.  We have heard from witnesses about such harm and concerns.  We could certainly wait for the Digital Services Act but that will take some time before it is adopted.  Dr. McIntyre outlined how quickly that is happening.  Nevertheless, we have a responsibility as legislators to deal right now with the problems of online harm.  I accept entirely that it is not going to be solved just with the creation of an office of an online safety commissioner.  There is a requirement around education, and this is a reflection of broader matters in society.<\/p> <p>  We have a responsibility nonetheless to be able to address some of the behaviour online and we know Twitter, Facebook and many other social media giants are not doing this.  I am open to the idea of a social media council and perhaps the witnesses could expand on that.  Facebook introduced an oversight board and again there is a question mark because Facebook appointed its members and I do not view it as independent.  I appreciate all the problems we are seeing but how, in the immediate term, can we solve all those challenges?<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to the human rights commission and I have a question on algorithmic decision-making.

We will launch a programme of work monitoring how artificial intelligence algorithms engage with questions of human rights in Ireland over the next couple of months.  As the Senator is aware, the European Union is bringing forward a package of measures in this area too and it is another example of where there are important developments at the Brussels level.  This is not a question of standing back and deferring to Europe but trying to advance measures without being cognisant of what is happening at the European level could be counterproductive in the longer term.  Dr. McIntyre has already dealt with that point.  Ms Cronin will address other measures.  We all accept there is a social problem that must be addressed but this might not be the right solution.

They spoke about the difference between a 13-year-old and a 17-year-old and how they can react to material online.  There is a big difference between a 13-year-old, a 17-year-old, a 36-year-old and a 66-year-old but all that nuance of the different layers are not in the Bill.

Ultimately, this Bill will restrict speech that is not illegal.

We can do this immediately in cases of serious abuse.  Unfortunately, we still find the prosecution of somebody for these kinds of abuse a rarity worthy of comment.  Unfortunately, we still find many individuals let down by the justice system.  I am a practising solicitor and I have encountered in my professional capacity a number of individuals who have been the victims of online abuse.  Very often their message is that they took their complaints to the Garda and were told the complaints could not be dealt with, that they were civil matters because the abusive material was hosted on a service in another jurisdiction, and there was nothing the Garda could do about the complaints.  We can handle that side of things - immediate, severe harms - already if we have the funding to do so.  We had functioning legislation under the old Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.  We now have stronger legislation in Coco's Law.  On that side of things, the challenge is enforcement, not new legislation.<\/p><p> To respond to Senator Byrne's broader question, which was what Ireland should do in the meantime, we can certainly progress with online harm legislation, but trying to shove it into the model of the audiovisual media services directive will be unproductive, particularly given that we see a different model coming down the road in the form of the Digital Services Act.  At this stage, to the extent we want to focus on particular categories of harm, bullying in particular, the committee could consider whether that is adequately dealt with in Coco's Law; if not, why not; and whether we should look at an expansion of that.  However, the aim here, to have a very ambitious package dealing with all online harms, is doomed to failure in its current form, partly because of the constitutional difficulties we, the ICCL, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission have identified but also because it tries to shove a square peg into a round hole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

I agree with the point I think she is making, which is that we are not going about this the right way in the current format, partly for the reasons I outlined to Senator Byrne.  If I may elaborate and give the committee just one concrete example of why this is, the Bill proposes to place obligations on the providers of private communications services by way of a media code to be adopted by the new commission.  In doing so, however, it seems to be completely unaware of the provisions of European law, the privacy directive and the new European electronic communications code, which would preclude the Bill from doing that.  Therefore, what is proposed, as it stands, simply could not be done.  I looked through the entire heads of the Bill and the regulatory impact analysis to see whether these pieces of legislation are mentioned but I could not find them mentioned anywhere.  It might be that there is another policy document I am not aware of that does so, but it seems to me the Bill reflects very much the broadcasting mindedness of its originator.  It reflects the priorities of a Department used to regulating a small number of large entities with relatively little freedom of expression litigation brought against it.  I can think of only one case of any great significance in this context in recent years.  This approach tends to fall down when applied to a much wider range of entities which also deal with private speech, which involves a much wider range of public individuals, rather than a small number of broadcasters and so on.  Again, I think the model we are looking at here is perhaps not the appropriate one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

There are ways in which the grounding of the Bill in human rights and equality principles could be more explicit, and the Law Society has made suggestions in this regard, but that will not get away from the core approach being taken here.  Dr. McIntyre has put it very well in saying it applies a broadcasting model aimed at large companies to enforcement against potentially small providers and then, indirectly, to private communications and the private speech of individuals.  How this will work in practice is that if companies are under these legal obligations, they will adjust their internal processes and algorithms and so on, which will have a knock-on effect on filtering the communications of ordinary people as well as the effect self-censorship might have.  It is difficult to get away from the fundamental human rights principles that apply to this question of vague definitions as to what types of speech might be proscribed.  Once you get beyond speech that is clearly illegal, and Digital Rights Ireland has cast some questions as to how even that might be defined, and into harmful content and more vague concepts such as bullying and disinformation, it becomes very difficult to strike an appropriate balance.  The approach, we find, is fundamentally flawed in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

They are correct we clearly need to define what is legal and illegal, especially when it comes to bullying.  I think we highlighted that in a previous committee meeting.  I acknowledge that defining something across the board is not the correct way.  What a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old considers harmful might not be harmful to someone in my age bracket.  Perhaps that needs to be taken into context.  I highlighted one line in the Digital Rights Ireland statement, \"it makes little sense to rush through the domestic provisions at this time\".

One example of other legislative developments going on in parallel that will have an impact on the Bill is the question of hate crime and incitement to hatred.  Separately, the Department of Justice has issued a policy paper aiming to review the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 and to legislate for hate crime for the first time.  The approach that has been taken in that case is very strongly grounded in principles of freedom of expression and will introduce statutory definitions of concepts to which the Bill we are discussing will then makes cross references.  Therefore, to advance this Bill before that legislation is enacted and resolves the definition in that Act will require further amendment down the line.<\/p><p> On the question of bullying, I wish to clarify that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties is a member of the Children's Rights Alliance.  We take the problem of bullying and the harm experienced by children very seriously, but it is important to bear in mind that the problem of bullying did not arrive with the Internet.  The supports that children require to be protected from harm include changes to the curriculum in schools and supports in schools.  There is also the chronic underinvestment by successive Governments in mental health and other supports for children.  The Oireachtas is rightly concerned about dealing with this problem, but the suggestion that this is the only measure to deal with it is a misdirection of energy and priority when, frankly, the Oireachtas has underperformed over a long period of time in providing the necessary financial and other resources to schools and other services that are trying to help children to develop resilience in the face of bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>We can make two brief points in response to Senator Carrigy's point.  One is that, to the extent that there are discrete concrete problems, we can sometimes deal with them in discrete ways which do not necessarily require going into this broader frame of legislation.  For example, with regard to material which promotes suicide, we can legislate to criminalise that more explicitly.  There is an existing prohibition, but we could legislate to widen that regarding the provision of information about the commission of suicide without any great difficulty.  That would provide a secure basis to deal with those cases.<\/p> <p>  More generally, however, there might be some misapprehension as to how far-reaching the effects of this Bill would be, if adopted.  The heads of the Bill propose that we legislate for providers who are established in the State.  Quite a few providers are established in Ireland because of our rather generous tax regime and this legislation would have a significant effect in respect of those, but it would have no effect at all on providers who are headquartered elsewhere.  I doubt it is the case, therefore, that there would be a huge reduction in certain types of concerning content, for example, material that promotes suicide or eating disorders, which is already relatively actively policed by the types of providers that tend to be headquartered in Ireland.  That material, to the extent that it is available from other providers elsewhere, will continue to be available from other providers elsewhere.  I do not believe we should overstate the effects of this legislation.  If we say we need to act quite quickly in respect of some of these issues, it is not the case that a purely domestic response, even given the number of tech firms headquartered in Ireland, is necessarily going to have that effect.  Unfortunately, this is an area where we have to look for international solutions as well.  For that reason we should consider the desirability of integrating this with the Digital Services Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child released general comment No. 25 last March.  Other people have raised this in previous sessions with the committee.  The committee consulted with 709 children across 28 countries and it states that meaningful access to digital technologies can support children to realise the full range of their civil, political, cultural, economic and social rights.  This is very important.  Children have a right to participate online and a right to seek, receive and impart information.  However, of course, children have the right to be protected from harm.  One way towards safeguarding the protection would be mandating service users to carry out children's rights impact assessments, as stated in the comment.  That was mentioned by previous witnesses, including Professor Conor O'Mahony and Dr. Karen McAuley.  Dr. McAuley also spoke about international frameworks that speak to the responsibilities of businesses in regard to human rights and children's rights.  We would support the call from both Professor O'Mahony and Dr. McAuley regarding the need for those assessments.<\/p> <p>  That same comment called for robust age verification systems that would be consistent with data protection and privacy requirements.

Although companies already offer communications services that are limited to children and that have parental controls, explicit filtering and so on, and there is nothing in the law to stop that, one of the problems when trying to legislate for it is that there a very large number of edge cases.  For example, there is sometimes the proposal that there should be child-only services, which sounds great but, of course, these do not deal with the problem of the 17-year-old being in a very different age bracket from a 12-year-old, nor do they deal with the problem of the 17-year-old who turns 18 and would like to talk to his or her friends, to take his or her friends&rsquo; messaging details with him or her, but finds he or she has now been aged out of the service.  While companies are working on child-only or child-friendly messaging services, at this stage at least we are not in the position to enshrine that in law.<\/p> <p>  The second point the Deputy made and which I would like to respond to briefly is the impact of this on political organisation.  There are two points I would make on that.  One is that a concerning aspect of these rules is that they would apply across the board.  They would, therefore, restrict what elected representatives say on their Facebook pages, Twitter pages or on their blogs that are hosted by Blogger or by WordPress.  It is an across-the-board form of control.  It is not restricted to what goes on through traditional, large broadcast media.  The second point related to private communications is that this would also potentially impact private communications between a constituent and an elected representative.  It would essentially require technology firms to look inside private communications and the cloud files representatives store in, for example, their Microsoft 365 storage or their Google Drive storage.  Again, as currently proposed, it seems this would be done without any requirement or judicial authorisation and based only on some possible source of internal authorisation within the commission.

Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey can continue to determine what is placed on their platforms.  They made a decision, with reference to the political point, on whether they would continue to allow Donald Trump to use their platforms and whether his language was harmful.  Whether you agree or disagree with what Donald Trump was saying, it was Zuckerberg, Dorsey and their teams who made the decision, rather than democratic society.

What we have at the moment is a regime whereby Silicon Valley determines both what can appear and the rules on social media in Ireland, whereas we as legislators do not have that role.  I accept this is a requirement for many states to work together on this.  If, however, we look at Germany where they have the network enforcement Act, and I appreciate their legislation around hate speech is stronger, they were able to ensure that with the issue of Holocaust denial, which is very clearly defined in German law, within 24 hours harmful content should be taken down.  Yes, we can wait for the Digital Services Act and, yes, we can wait for perfection, but this is a challenge we need to address.

Similarly, it is important that there are other forums which might, for example, set out to make themselves child friendly and exclude material that would be suitable for adults but not for children.<br\/><br\/>Conversely, if we get to a point where the State can prescribe, in some detail, what kind of content a service must not carry, short of it being illegal, and can also prescribe what content it must carry, for example, in a European context, with proposals to require political leaders' speech to be carried, notwithstanding that it might be offensive, we will rapidly end up with the State supplanting the editorial judgment of the service.  That might be considered desirable but it would place a greater burden on the State, in order to comply with the requirements of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the standards under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, to prescribe clearly what can and cannot be done and to provide a State redress scheme in respect of that and so on.<br\/><br\/>The risk for Senator Malcolm Byrne is that if he gets what he wants, it will restrict the freedom to regulate because we will end up with the State taking on more responsibilities while having a weaker ability to control than private entities would.  We cannot have a State rule that would provide that, for example, material harmful to children or material lacking in taste and so on should be precluded.  Private entities are free to do that if they wish.  There is a catch-22 here.  The greater the degree of State involvement in these policies, the more difficult it becomes to regulate, precisely because a greater degree of precision and State supervision of regulation will be needed.  If the Senator would like to encourage tech firms to regulate, there are ways of doing that, such as requiring them to adopt policies or to be transparent about the application of their policies and so on, without necessarily being prescriptive as to what they can and cannot carry within the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021052600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

If statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.

We meet against the backdrop of the significant ransomware attack on the HSE that has seriously impacted on the ability of our hospitals and wider health services to provide essential services to our citizens and on the front-line staff in the health service who have been working under extraordinary pressure over the last 14 months since the start of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, has been supporting the HSE in dealing with the ransomware attack since the NCSC was notified of the incident early on the morning of Friday, 14 May.  Following this notification, the NCSC immediately activated its national critical cyberincident response plan.  Since that initial contact, the NCSC has been working intensively to support the HSE and external contractors in the response to the incident and to restore essential services as quickly as possible.  From the outset, the NCSC has liaised with European Union and other international partners to share information and to ensure that the HSE had immediate access to international cyber supports.<\/p> <p>  While steady progress is being made in bringing systems and services back online, the HSE is best placed to provide updates on the restoration of services and it is doing so on an ongoing basis.  The NCSC has also worked with the HSE and external experts to identify the technical details of the malware used in this incident, so that it can share these details with both its constituent bodies and more broadly through advisories.  The NCSC has issued public advice concerning the cyberattack on the HSE and general guidance on ransomware attacks.  This information is available on the NCSC's website and will be updated as required.  A dedicated team in the NCSC has also been providing specific guidance to its constituents, including Departments and Government agencies, together with operators of essential services, on appropriate measures they can take to reduce the risk of further ransomware incidents on their networks.  Staff at the NCSC have been in direct contact with the operators of essential services and this will continue throughout the coming days.<\/p> <p>  I will now provide the committee with some information on the role and functions of the NCSC, including how it supports hundreds of organisations across the Irish public and private sectors as they seek to mitigate the risk of a cyberattack.  The NCSC was established by a Government decision and it has a broad remit encompassing the cybersecurity of Government ICT and critical national infrastructure.  It acts as a central contact point in the event of a Government or nationwide cybersecurity incident that affects the State.  The NCSC also co-ordinates and supports the response to significant incidents, with the lead role being taken by the entity affected by the incident.  The computer security incident response team, CSIRT, is the team within the NCSC that leads in responding to cybersecurity incidents.  The CSIRT has achieved international accreditation, and it is this team that engages with the affected body to support it in addressing a threat.<\/p> <p>  Information sharing is a key component of the work of the NCSC, and it acts as a source of expert advice and guidance, as well as a clearing house for information.  It takes in threat intelligence data and trends and risks data from national, global and local sources and then analyses the information.  Subsequently, the centre ensures that the people and organisations that need those data get them to protect their own systems or to assist them in carrying out their statutory roles.  The NCSC is in regular and frequent communication with international counterparts and the exchange of information is a two-way street.  The NCSC also supports public bodies, operators of essential services and digital service providers to improve their cybersecurity posture and fulfil their obligations under the European Union's network and information security, NIS, directive.  The NCSC takes a proactive role in supporting these important bodies to continually build their cybersecurity resilience through a range of initiatives, including by hosting seminars and workshops.<\/p> <p>  A great deal of commentary has addressed the level of funding and resources allocated to the NCSC and to cybersecurity across Government.  When considering the overall resources available to the State in preventing, mitigating and managing cyberattacks, it is important to recall that the principal investment made by the State is the substantial investment made by individual Departments and public sector bodies in their own IT security infrastructure and IT security staff.  In the case of Departments and non-commercial State bodies, this money is funded from the Exchequer and is many times the figure of &euro;5 million which has been quoted in commentary in the last fortnight.<\/p> <p>  The NCSC team comprises highly skilled, specialist technical civilian staff, with skill sets in areas such as computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development, and cybersecurity compliance, as well as general cybersecurity skills.<\/p><p>The expertise and competence of the NCSC team has been very much in evidence over these past 13 days in how the team has supported the HSE in dealing with the attack. <\/p><p> The NCSC had a staff complement of 29 at the start of 2021.  In addition to payroll costs, the NCSC has funding of &euro;5.1 million available to it this year, compared with &euro;1.7 million in 2020.  I stress again, however, that the principal investment in cybersecurity is in the form of the collective investment made by individual organisations.<\/p><p> Recognising that the environment in which the NCSC operates is extremely dynamic, a detailed capacity review of the NCSC is being undertaken to inform Government as to how the NCSC needs to evolve going forward.  This capacity review is being carried out by an expert international consultancy.  It is due to report in the coming weeks, in line with the timeline for completion of this work of the second quarter of 2021, set out in the 2019 national cybersecurity strategy.  <\/p><p> I will consider the report of the capacity review and its recommendations, together with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Government consideration may also be required, having regard to the focus of the report.  It will inform the future developments of the NCSC and it will indicate the extent of any additional resources required to deliver its mandate, the objectives under the 2019 strategy and other emerging obligations arising at EU level.<\/p><p> As I have outlined, the NCSC is working with stakeholders to strengthen cybersecurity across Government networks and critical national infrastructure.  Ireland&rsquo;s national cybersecurity strategy for the period of 2019 to 2024 sets out an ambitious programme of measures to further develop Ireland&rsquo;s cybersecurity capacity.  The key themes of the strategy are to protect, to develop and to engage.  That involves the protection of the State, its people, and its critical national infrastructure from threats in the cybersecurity realm; the development of the capacity of the State, of research institutions, of businesses and of citizens; and the engagement by the State, nationally and internationally, in a strategic manner, supporting a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace. <\/p><p> An interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, oversees the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy.  The committee meets quarterly to review progress.  To date, good progress has been made in delivering the 20 measures in the five-year strategy.  The capacity review will feed into decisions to be taken, to ensure that this ambitious strategy is delivered in full.<\/p><p> Finally, I want to put on record my gratitude to the HSE staff, the NCSC, external contractors, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, staff from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, international partners and others who have been engaged 24-7 in dealing with this appalling criminal attack.<\/p><p> I would be happy to take questions from this committee on the role and functions of the NCSC, although there may be questions that it would not be possible or appropriate to address in a public forum and particularly where doing so could disclose information which might assist criminals to identify potential vulnerabilities in IT security arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#A00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

He will rightly understand that, as politicians, we all share the same objective.  It is, in the first instance, to try to understand insofar as we can, what vulnerabilities existed that we might have protected against and then what we can do, from a legislative perspective, to put ourselves front and centre in the defence against the next wave of cyberattacks.  I have watched the Minister of State's television and media appearances in recent days and it is clear that he is far better versed in this area than I am, or perhaps others are.  He is well suited to the job at hand.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, I want to understand what gaps he has identified.  Is it possible that we could have been better protected or that our overall defence architecture could have been better?  This is not about blaming anybody.  It is about an iterative approach to the learnings towards finding a solution.  It would be remiss if we were dive in and attempt to find a solution without first taking a careful approach to understanding what happened and what needs to be put in place.<\/p> <p>  We had some discussions last week about a review that was already under way.  Is there some report or perhaps a draft report in place?  Maybe the Minister of State could confirm that and whether he would be in a position to share that with the committee on a confidential basis, if necessary.  We all recognise what happened here.  There are committees in other jurisdictions that are briefed in a very detailed way about matters of national security, and this is certainly one.  It is the case that documents circulate from committees but in an issue like this, it might be worth, on a pilot basis, briefing the committee and, if necessary, having people sign the Official Secrets Act, to see if we can develop some kind of an approach towards an ongoing process in terms of an input into the defence.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the Minister of State had the opportunity to hear some of the briefings yesterday but one of the contractors made it clear that cybersecurity is not a destination; it is a journey.  That would seem to suggest that we need to be engaged on an ongoing basis.  I will leave it at that and will listen to what the Minister of State has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#B00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dooley.  He is absolutely right that cybersecurity is a journey, and not a destination.  I will start with the Senator's question on what vulnerabilities might have shown up that we might have protected against.  That question will be analysed as a result of the three inquiries that will go on.  Clearly, the focus right now is on resolving the problems with the HSE's network in getting its services working again.  However, the Garda investigation is going on.  There will be a data protection investigation.  The HSE will have to report back to us.  It is doing is IT investigation to see how this happened.  It will report back to the NCSC and we will analyse and strengthen as a result of that.  We do not know the result of this yet.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the report of the capacity review, which was commissioned at the start of the year, this was envisaged in the programme for Government, that we should review the capacity of the National Cyber Security Centre to see whether it is capable of carrying out its functions and how it compares with other cybersecurity centres of similar size with similar challenges around the world.  Are there any skills that we do not have?  Does it need additional resources?  It is not just a question of what we do this year, but of how that plays out for the next five years.  How should the National Cyber Security Centre develop over the coming five years to address increasing challenges?  Obviously, every year more services go online, more people go online, and the threats become larger, as these cybercriminals collect ransoms from companies which pay up.  They are becoming stronger and there is an arms race, then, between them and the cybersecurity professionals in protecting themselves. <\/p> <p>  In terms of whether I can publish the report that comes out, I do not have the report yet.  A draft has been done.  I have been briefed about it by my officials.  Of course, it will be reviewed in the light of this most recent incident.  However, it will recommend what the staffing should be over the coming five years and whether we are lacking any resources.<\/p> <p>  I need to strike a balance between transparency, democracy and being able to share with the committee what the conclusions are, while at the same time being able to protect the national interests and make sure they do not expose weaknesses to attackers that they could potentially use to their benefit.  I am happy to engage with both the Chair and the committee members to find how we do that.  I will look at how other cybersecurity centres find that balance between transparency, democracy, and national security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#B00400","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#B00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Can the Senator be very brief?

It is almost, as the Minister of State referenced, a GCHQ kind of scenario, but the analogy of the fire service is quite useful.

They mentioned Estonia, the UK and Israel - somewhat controversially I suppose in the context of other events going on - but they did say that they are particularly good at it.  Is there an EU role for this particular office?  Could or should there be?  Clearly, a threat to one member state is a threat to all of us.  Equally, has there been any contact with experts in the field, whether they be Israeli, British or equally any member state, particularly the likes of Estonia, which had a very digital economy when it was set up in 1991?<\/p> <p>  We have also talked a great deal about funding, salary scales and so on.  The Minister of State clarified some of that for us.

There is a pandemic going on, staff are running around and IT security may not be top of their priority list.  That is especially true when they are being asked to rapidly develop new systems to cope with the pandemic and bring them online within a couple of weeks.  All the staff were working hard to enable the clinical staff to work from home.  They were under pressure but the HSE was in a much stronger position this year than it would have been two years ago, for example.

He mentioned that the NCSC's work involves cybersecurity resilience through a range of initiatives, including hosting seminars and workshops, and working with Government agencies and Departments in that regard.  Does the NCSC perform audits on Government agencies?  Does it have that power?  Is it within its remit to go to an agency and say it is going to do a rundown of its system and if it sees any issues they can work through them?  Would that all have to come to the NCSC from the agencies?  If a systemic flaw or weakness is found, does the NCSC have any powers to compel an agency to fix it?  Obviously one would imagine it is in an agency's best interests to fix any weaknesses that are found but has there ever been a case where an agency said it did not have the funding to fix any structural issues, against NCSC advice?

It does not.  It also does not issue compliance orders against other Government agencies, on the basis that one Minister does not tell another Minister what to do.

The operators of essential services can be, and are, audited by the NCSC and it can issue compliance orders against them.  It is empowered by the NIS directive if there is something the operator has not done.  That is the balance.  There is a difference between risk assessments and audits.

Obviously, there is a need for that to be dealt with.  However, there is also a need for backup support and new architecture to be put in place.  In relation to technicians and recruitment, do we have sufficient numbers of people with the necessary skills, qualifications and expertise?  At the moment, everyone is on alert.  The private sector will also be seeking to recruit these people.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the State can recruit and that the terms and conditions of the offers that we are making will be sufficient to attract people into our cybersecurity centre?<\/p><p> Second, I wish to ask the Minister of State about indications from the private sector on the payment of ransoms.  The State, the Minister of State and Government have taken the correct decision to refuse to pay a ransom.  If we pay it once, we will be paying it forever.  I am getting a fair indication from the private sector that many companies have already succumbed to the pressure and have paid ransoms.  What indications are the Minister of State and his Department receiving to that effect?  In respect of the HSE and the other State agencies that have a duty of care to protect information, where does the Data Protection Commissioner sit in this?  Is there an open line of discussion between the Government and the Data Protection Commissioner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#E02100","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I know that he has experience in this Ministry.<\/p> <p>  The first point I would make is that in respect of recruitment, the NCSC has told me that it has not had any difficulty in the past.  It is recruiting both from the private and public sectors.  There is an attraction to working in such an important and key role in defending the country in that way and defending our critical infrastructure.  My impression, from working very closely with the staff over the last few weeks, is that they are very engaged, highly motivated, have good morale, are extremely skilled, and that we are not in a position of being under-resourced.  However, demand for additional increase will, of course, increase over the coming years as the threat increases.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about private sector companies paying ransoms.  That is what the criminals describe as their business model, but it is really an extortion racket.  The idea is that a company is put in a position where it is faced with a choice of paying a ransom or going out of business because its reputation will be so badly damaged, it will not be able to find its customers or how much its customers owe it.  It is an existential choice.  It is not the same for a non-profit organisation or a Government.  We will not go out of business if we do not pay the ransom.  Therefore, it is a different situation.  If people do not pay the ransom, then the criminals cannot continue and it is the end of their business.  Of course, we want to find ways to ensure that people do not pay ransoms.  However, I do understand that when a company is put in that position it is do or die.  That is the situation with that issue.  We have taken the right decision.  Other Governments and private companies are supporting us in this and agree that if we were to pay the ransom it would attract more of the same.<\/p> <p>  On the data protection question, data protection comes under the remit of the Department of Justice.  I cannot comment on what the Data Protection Commission will do.  It has a statutory function and investigates when a data protection breach occurs.  There has clearly been a huge breach in this case.  I cannot comment on what the commission will do.  However, I think we can all expect what is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#F00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for joining us today.  I am aware that he has plenty of other things to be doing at this time.<\/p> <p>  I stated yesterday that Ireland lacks security awareness and a culture of security.  It may well be based on some sort of belief in the goodness of people, which, I might say, is misguided. Does the Minister of State believe that we should increase the budget for the national cybersecruity to the &euro;50 million that was projected by Mr. Pat Larkin yesterday?<\/p> <p>  I circulated a paper last night which the Minister of State will have received.  Every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas received a copy of a paper written by Mr. Pat Larkin in 2018 in which much of what has happened was predicted.  I know that the Minister of State is not long in the Ministry, so I am not pointing any fingers at him.  However, it would suggest a lack of awareness. <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Senator Horkan, referred to ethical hacking.  In one of the Minister of State's responses, he mentioned working across other Ministers' areas of responsibility.  If I may say to the Minister of State, to hell with the niceties.  We are in a war.  Cybersecurity is now the fourth realm of national security and we are at war.  As we were told yesterday, we are on a journey to which there is no end.  Would the Minister of State agree that it is time that we set aside the niceties and started using ethical hacking and finding the weaknesses right across State and semi-State bodies?  If we step on somebody's toes in the meantime, sorry about it, but that is what it takes.<\/p> <p>  Next, I wish to raise the issue of software.  We have heard that some of the HSE computers were running Windows XP and Windows 7.  If that is true, it is outrageous that it would be allowed to go on.  Is the Minister of State going to take steps to ensure that every Government agency updates its software to the most modern version available and has the most modern security software?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to raise an issue that is perhaps a little out of left field and which the Minister of State may not have expected.  He may not wish to respond and I accept that.  I have been contacted by a significant number of people who registered on the HSE website for Covid-19 vaccination appointments and all of a sudden started to receive spurious calls asking them for money.

The capacity review projects an increasing number of staff over the coming four years.  We must remember they are a very small number of the staff involved in cybersecurity in Ireland.  Throughout the various Departments, for example Revenue and the Department of Social Protection, there are extensive security teams, each of which could be larger than the NCSC itself.

Many people were on site within a short period of time.  That day, they were 300 people available to work on it.

We will set ourselves a goal but by the time we get to that goal, it may have passed us out again.  A point I made yesterday was if this is what the next decade will look like and if the past fortnight has proved that Ireland may be the soft underbelly of Europe in some ways and we may be open for more attacks, it may be prudent to look beyond our shores to other countries that have a high budgetary spend on cybersecurity and that are allies of ours within the European Union and to lean on them for a bit of support.  Senator Craughwell called this a war.  It is not a war but it is a conflict of sorts.  By leaning on a European neighbour with a well-developed capacity to do this, we would not compromise our neutrality, to call it that, in any shape or form.  We would be doing something smart, which would be to view this as an immediate problem that needs immediate redress.<\/p> <p>  It scares me to think it could take five or ten years.  Yesterday, we had a debate about the cost of hiring the helmsman or helmswoman for this organisation.  I believe we are getting very caught up in that issue and are not looking at where the next attack could happen.  As a former primary schoolteacher, I fear for the sensitive data of many schools on Windows XP and Windows 7.  Tusla files could potentially get out there.  Worst of all would be if the Garda PULSE system was hacked in some way.  Imagine how atrocious it would be, were sensitive files from the local Garda station to be circulating online.

Yes, we have sustained a significant attack and the attack is far worse than anything that has happened previously in Ireland but these type of attacks are happening throughout the world in countries that have an extensive security apparatus.  For example, in the United States there have been 300 very large-scale ransomware attacks on major corporations, including 16 hospitals or emergency departments, in the past year alone.  It was revealed last week that an insurance company in Chicago paid out a $40 million ransom.  This is in the country that has the National Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA and the FBI.  Despite all of this, these organisations have been penetrated and attacked and there has been an attempt to collect ransom.  The single incident that has happened in Ireland is not proof there is something fundamentally wrong with Ireland's cybersecurity.  Of course it will be a lesson, and it means we will be stronger and more resilient afterwards.  We are looking at what the next threat is.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about co-operation with our European neighbours and this is absolutely essential.  We are a small country.  We are 1% of Europe's population.  We rely on information sharing and co-operation sharing with our European partners and we are well regarded in this way.  We are heavily engaged not just with European countries and members of the EU but also with the UK and the US, and they have been very helpful throughout the incident.

That type of co-operation at policing level and computer security incident response team, CSIRT, level is critical.  It is the way we can defeat these criminals.

I will try to be brief, but there is a lot to be said.  I welcome the question-and-answer session that will follow my statement.<\/p> <p>  F&oacute;rsa represents over 80,000 members, including approximately 5,000 workers in aviation.  In attendance with me today are members of the cabin crew branch, representing over 2,000 cabin crew across all airlines.  Cabin crew have endured over 14 months of pay cuts, lay-offs, redundancies and job insecurity.  Our members continue to live with high levels of uncertainty and have lived with fear and anxiety as to what the future holds for them.  This has put cabin crew and aviation workers and their families under massive strain.  For many, the mortgage and other debts incurred over this period will be a burden for years to come.  Our members worry that the current employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, is due to end.  To date, there has been no announcement of an extension.  We all have heard the comments that there will be no cliff edge, but those statements are not enough.  The lack of any detail is contributing to our members' fear and anxiety.  F&oacute;rsa is calling, and has called, for an aviation-specific income support scheme.  Failure to provide that will undoubtedly risk further hardship for our members, and more jobs will be lost in the sector.<\/p> <p>  Throughout the pandemic cabin crew have done everything possible to help their country.  They are deemed essential workers and have remained flying essential routes, maintaining vital connectivity.  However, it is widely acknowledged that the Irish aviation sector has experienced the largest decline in comparison with anywhere else in Europe.  While we acknowledge and appreciate the uncertain times we live in, there is a need for us to do better.  What we need now is political leadership, a clear roadmap setting out the return to international travel.  We must remain a globally connected open economy where trade and tourism thrive.  We have to provide hope to families that they can be reunited with their loved ones living abroad.  The continued contradictory statements by various Ministers must stop.  What is needed now is clarity.  If we fail to provide the certainty required, the aviation sector may never recover.<\/p> <p>  To date, there has been a lack of commitment from the Government as to how and when travel can resume.  At previous meetings of this committee, F&oacute;rsa has called for State supports to the industry to be strictly conditional, with no compulsory redundancies or offshoring of services.  If these conditions had been in place, that may have offered our members greater protection against the devastating news in Shannon and Cork last week.  F&oacute;rsa remains greatly concerned that failure to provide the necessary supports as a matter of urgency may mean further announcements across the sector.  Some, such as the situation at Shannon, could be irreversible and could contribute to a more general erosion of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation connectivity.<\/p> <p>  Our message is clear.  We need tangible plans.  We are calling on the Government to provide the necessary income supports, provide clear and precise guidance to allow a resumption of international travel, to send a clear message that we are open to key markets and to state that Ireland will adopt the European Commission green digital certificate immediately.  We must reopen the common travel area.  As we all know, the UK's vaccination rates are well ahead of those in Ireland.  We need to develop a clear travel corridor with the US.  We also must consider affordable testing, something the committee has recommended.  Testing cannot became an impediment to a return to international travel.  Finally, we must engage on plans for the future viability of regional airports.  I refer particularly to Shannon and Cork in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Following the announcement by Aer Lingus on 18 May, it is important to put on the record the impact this has had on our members based in Shannon.  It will have a devastating impact on cabin crew based in Shannon who, between them, have accumulated more than 2,000 years of service to the company.  It will also have a devastating impact on the tourism and hospitality sector, and many have expressed fears about what impact the announcement may have on inward investment in the region.  It must be recognised that this is a traumatic time for cabin crew members and their families in Shannon.  After giving such long service to Aer Lingus the company has decided to close the base, claiming it is inefficient, having been out of line with the market for many years, is inefficient due to its geographical location and that the scale of the operation has not been enough to deliver cabin crew base efficiencies and the productivity required.<\/p> <p>  Cabin crew based in Shannon have never been found wanting.  They have worked with the company throughout all other crises &ndash; the 1990s Gulf War, the post-2009 economic crash, the 11 September 2001 attacks, the volcanic ash cloud in 2010 and the Greenfield and Cahill plans, to name just a few.  Over the years they have altered their work practices and demonstrated the required flexibility to ensure the viability of the Shannon base.  However, last week Aer Lingus appeared to simply give up rather than develop solutions.  Our members feel quite strongly about this.  It is not a voluntary option.  The company is closing the base and they do not have a choice.  They want to work with the company to find solutions in order to protect the base.  They are angry with the company and with the Government.  They are angry with the company for its decision to close the base without engagement to find solutions, and the manner in which it delivered this devastating news.  They are angry with their elected representatives for not ensuring the appropriate protections were in place, such as supports only being provided on the conditions F&oacute;rsa has previously outlined.  The closure of Shannon illustrates the consequences of failing to include that conditionality.<\/p> <p>  More than 80 families in the west of Ireland are at risk of losing their careers and their livelihoods.  The airline will be at risk of losing extensive experience.  The impact this will have on connectivity in the region will affect tourism and hospitality.  The effect on local communities and the local economy will be devastating for years to come.  We are calling on members of the committee to intervene and to lend their voices to protect this base.  It is vital not only for ourselves but for all the west of Ireland, tourism and future investment that we protect this base and ensure it remains in place.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some brief statements with regard to Cork.  It was with disbelief that we became aware of the decision to close Cork Airport for maintenance of the runway at a time when travel restrictions are likely to ease.  The impact of this is that cabin crew in the majority of airlines will be laid off.  No certainty has been provided as to what entitlements they may be able to claim, which is causing unnecessary stress.  Aer Lingus has also announced further redundancies for the base.  We must ensure that protections are in place to prevent a risk to the Cork base also.<\/p><p> We call on the Government to ensure that appropriate income supports are in place.  We ask that our members remain on the payroll with the assistance of the necessary income supports while maintenance works are carried out.  We need to ensure that the necessary conditionality is attached to any supports provided to any companies.  That is no compulsory redundancies and no offshoring of services.  We ask that the Government aligns itself to our members in Shannon and Cork to ensure that both bases are protected.  We need a plan for the regional airports and we need to ensure that they remain viable into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ashley Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Quite a number of members wish to comment but, unfortunately, we must finish at 1.35 p.m. at the latest.

I have engaged with many of them recently and in the past months.<\/p><p>Many factors have got us to this point with Covid being number one.  There is also mandatory hotel quarantine, which was necessary during very high levels of Covid but it certainly has not helped in recent weeks.  Lastly, there is the decision by Aer Lingus.<\/p><p>The Aer Lingus decision to close its Shannon base on the eve of the return of international travel can only be summed up as Aer Lingus taking the taxpayer for a ride because it has availed hugely of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  I have a copy of a redacted Aer Lingus cabin crew contract with me.  It very clearly states that his or her contract is to the airline not to the Shannon base yet Aer Lingus whether it has been a temporary lay-off or base closure it has cherrypicked and gone after Shannon.<\/p><p>I have a question for Ms Mary Mulholland and Mr. Gerry Clarke from the Shannon base.  Many people initially interpreted the talk of inefficiency as a dig at Shannon Airport corporate.  I believe that it is a dig at Aer Lingus's workforce and loyal employees who stood by the company for many years.  The fact remains that if one took up employment with Aer Lingus 15 months ago in Dublin then one is still employed.  However, if one has worked with Aer Lingus for 30 years at Shannon then the attitude is &quot;good luck&quot;, which has pretty much been the attitude to date.  What do Ms Mulholland and Mr. Clarke understand the term &quot;inefficient&quot; to mean?  Is ageism involved?  Does it relate to the payroll?  Does it relate to pay and conditions at the Shannon base?  Many things could be held culpable but we want to get to the bottom of the issue today.  From an industrial relations point of view, Shannon has been singled out.  The crisis has been used as an excuse to carry out what Aer Lingus has wanted to do for a very long time and that is to slowly withdraw from Shannon.  Whatever we do as a Government and any supports that we provide from here on must be conditional on certain strings attached <i>quid pro quo<\/i>in terms of support for Shannon, its workers and its routes.  What does inefficient mean from the point of view of the cabin crew in Shannon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#K00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.

The crew who will be made redundant are significantly senior in the company.  I am number 82 in the company and the members will all know how many people are in the company.  The most experienced people with the longest service, the most loyal and the ones who have put their shoulder to the wheel so far and rolled up their sleeves, as Ms Connolly said earlier countless times are the ones who are being targeted in this position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Mulholland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and I thank the Chairman for the chance to speak today.<\/p> <p>  Ms Mulholland has alluded to the 81 employees with long service ranging from 20 to 34 years and that is the only inefficiency that Aer Lingus is targeting but it is not one.  People should remember that in 2013-2014 we introduced the 757 aircraft, which made us right sized and efficient.  It was the right-sized aircraft that had high load factors and was in service until 2019.  From 2019 onwards, we had the A321 Neo that had even further fuel efficiency of anything up to 25% on a round trip to Boston or New York.<\/p> <p>  The targeting of the base has been gone on for a long time.  When a crisis happens Shannon is targeted by the company, unfortunately, and we never know the reason.  We have become efficient.<\/p> <p>  For the mid-west region, &euro;3.8 billion was the economic impact in 2019 and that must mean something to the Government.  It should have meant something to Aer Lingus but it seems that it did not, which means that the company is not in tune with the balanced regional development of this country.  The revenue means the base has the highest economic percentage impact per passenger coming through the airport.  From the perspective of the cabin crew, this aspect should be a very important point for the retention of the cabin crew base.<\/p> <p>  The national planning framework states that Galway and Limerick should have a population growth of up to 50% up to 2040.  That is not going to happen.  Regardless of Aer Lingus saying that it will operate out of Shannon, it will not be without a cabin crew basis so one cannot plan a viable operation that will see a decent level of economic activity because, more than likely, there will not be early morning flights and there will be no arrivals in the evening.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the transatlantic sector, if this issue is not rectified then the mid-west region is going to crumble and there is a severe possibility that the US Customs and Border Protection, CBP, in Shannon will close down and Shannon will become like a mothball thus making it completely unattractive for anybody to fly into.  This issue is a huge concern.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the cabin crew and their families, I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.       <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":709,"content":"<p>It is a long-established principle of last in, first out in any company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#K00800","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":710,"content":"<p>Deputy, we are all working together on this issue but I am very conscious of time.

We, as a committee, have raised the aviation sector at every opportunity with the powers that be in the Government and continue to do so.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on the floor of the D&aacute;il today again and raised the specific case of the cabin crew in Shannon.  The decision has been made under the cover of Covid and it needs to be reversed.  Without doubt the longest serving and most loyal people in the company are being targeted.  We have engaged with the cabin crew.  I know many of them personally so I know the care and dedication that they have put in over the years.  It is a sad indictment of Aer Lingus that it would target the most loyal and hardest working people in the company.<\/p> <p>  I seek an explanation of the following.  The Neo aircraft brought a new opportunity for Shannon, which was recognised across the company.  The cabin crew is the same.  Yet Aer Lingus has mentioned in its statement that the cabin crew has been out of line for a long time, was inefficient and was not working.  The decision has been made at a time when the reopening plan for aviation is due to be announced next Friday.

I will not go into fuel hedging issues now but it is very important to note that the efficiencies are based on data from 2013 onwards.  In Shannon, we had a situation where there were routes to Malaga and Faro but we were not using them because we were told there were not enough crew members.  In 2019, prior to the pandemic, we were supposed to do Barcelona and Paris but were told that crews from other bases were needed for those routes because we did not have enough crew.  I do not know where the inefficiencies are coming from, given the fact that the operation did not allow us to fulfil the full schedule in 2019.  We had to be supplemented from the other bases.  I do not know where the inefficiencies are coming from and to me, that still has to be proven.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>This committee has been asked to do a number of things.

My sense of it is that some of this is, at the very least, strategic.  Previous contributors suggested that this is a strategy on the part of the company which is possibly using Covid-19 as a cover.  Reference was also made to the extent of State supports.  What does the future hold in terms of the prospect of offshoring?  Is it happening already or is the threat of it there?  In terms of the supports that are in place, there is a concern that there will be a cliff edge.  In terms of short-time work supports, for example, a number of cabin crew have already contacted me because they have moved over to jobseeker's allowance.  These are people who have liabilities.  I ask Ms Connolly to give us a sense of the concerns of workers and the future direction of travel for Aer Lingus in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#L00400","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and will try to answer both elements of his question.  First, offshoring is a real risk.  Aircraft can be moved to any base and airlines will move their aircraft to more profitable bases with less stringent restrictions.  Offshoring is a very real risk.  We are seeing bases opening up but we are very concerned about what travel in Ireland will look like in the future.  Will we be able to maintain the routes we currently have, never mind expand?  In pre-Covid times we were hearing statements to the effect that Ireland will be an island at the centre of the globe but now we will be lucky to maintain what we have.  There is much talk about the need for FDI but we will shut off half of Ireland if the bases at Cork and Shannon close.  What will happen then?  Everything will become more centralised in the east, which is not what anybody wants to see happening.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Deputy's question on income supports.  Every day I deal with cabin crew members who are extremely worried.  They are trying to engage with their banks and to address their own personal outgoings.  Some have children doing their leaving certificate this year and they do not know if they will be able to afford the college registration fees that are due in September.  To put it in perspective, in March 2020, people were earning 100% of their salaries but, since then, their earnings have ranged from 30% to 60%, depending on their base location.  Imagine losing 50% of one's income for that length of time, with no timeline for when one will recover that income.  How is one supposed to plan?  How can one's family be secure?  People are making very harsh decisions every day.  There is an obligation on the Government to put income supports in place and in doing so, to underline the fact that such supports are contingent on employment being protected, with no compulsory redundancies.  Then we could actually ensure, through engagement, that our members in Cork would not have to be laid off but could remain on the payroll with the use of these supports.  The issue is the lack of certainty.  I cannot reassure my members who are asking what they will be earning on 1 July.  The company cannot reassure them either because it does not know what supports will be in place on 1 July, which is only 30 days from now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ashley Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I will begin by confirming that I am within the Leinster House complex.  I thank the witnesses for attending and for providing us with an important opportunity to discuss the issues facing cabin crew and others working in aviation.  I have been very clear about my position on these issues and on what we need to do.  Very important decisions will be made when the Cabinet meets this Friday.  The Government needs to carefully consider the Ferguson report.  Professor Mark Ferguson, the director general of Science Foundation Ireland, produced a phenomenal report on the benefits of antigen testing.  If we want to avoid a situation where even more workers are laid off and are left in the unfortunate position of being without a job, then this committee must do everything it can to encourage NPHET and the Government to consider antigen testing so that people can get back to work and those who have lost employment can regain it.<\/p><p>The witnesses have hit the nail on the head in terms of sector-specific supports and it is incredibly important that this is looked at in more detail in the context of aviation.  There are very few industries that have been hit as hard as aviation.  Many aviation workers are now facing the prospect of losing their jobs.  We must ask if it would be beneficial to consider sector-specific supports for aviation workers who will hopefully be back to some degree of normality in a number of months.

The nature of the regulations that govern workplaces do not, unfortunately, always apply to the aviation sector.  It has left us exposed.  Many cabin crew do their jobs as a vocation and are passionate about what they do.  Many of them do not think twice when they go out there and they know that many people are travelling for essential reasons at the moment.  They are travelling for emergencies and deaths, to visit people who are sick and for absolutely essential business reasons.

I understand the rationale that is being used to prioritise age during the roll-out of vaccines.  However, our workforce is exposed in a way others are not.  It would be great to get recognition of that from the vaccination programme.  Many of those in our workforce are in their 20s and, as we have known throughout the pandemic, someone of that age is not necessarily immune to the effects of the disease.  It is important to us.

Following on from what Ms Connolly said, if we had introduced a proper support model for aviation workers, especially airline workers, who have been even more affected than workers in some of the other aviation areas, and had something like the German model, Aer Lingus might not have to make the decision it made last week.  It would have been able possibly to make a decision to keep us in receipt of supports and on the payroll and we would have been able to pay our mortgages, be part of society and have some standard of living but we have no such standard now.  We are living on the pandemic unemployment payment and have to go to the banks all the time to see if we can have a chat with them.

I am not just one person affected by this.  When I lose my job I will become a different drain on the Irish economy.  I have a family of five and am only one of 83 people who have families dependent upon them.  They will very quickly become dependent upon the State.  That is what is happening.  A total of 83 families is affected by this, not to mention the western region.  We are being shortsighted in only thinking about now; we should be looking at the bounce back in the industry.  I have been around for a million bounce backs.  I have seen how they come.  They are swift.  When there is a bounce back housewives go shopping to New York, families go to Eurodisney and families finally has enough money to take their children abroad, for example, to the Wet and Wild water park in Orlando.  When that bounce back comes it will be too late for me.  I will be gone and my job in the west will be lost.  My contribution to the community in the west will be gone.  It will be too late for me.

I could spend an hour giving out about Aer Lingus and its approach to Shannon over the years.  I am deeply frustrated with its activities but that would be a pointless waste of the few minutes I have.  I am equally frustrated with the Government, of which the party I am a member of is part.  I was frustrated with the mandatory hotel quarantine, the focus on non-essential travel and I continue to be frustrated with the lack of a coherent plan that gives certainty to airlines.  I am also frustrated that for some time now the lesson of the separation of Shannon from the national aviation authority has not been addressed.  With their intimate knowledge of the region and the difficulties Aer Lingus and other airlines have had, do Mr Clarke and Ms Mulholland think it is time for bringing the three State airports together and forgetting the notion of airports competing against each other?  Should they instead work effectively as a block and let the airports challenge the airlines to ensure they meet the critical regional development we desperately need?  If we leave Dublin Airport to compete with Shannon Airport during this recovery phase, one does not need to be a Mensa scientist to know full well &ndash; and this is not being negative towards Dublin &ndash; they will consolidate their activities because of the significant costs and where the population resides.  In addition to the Government needing to come forward with a plan, we should link whatever future moneys are provided to Aer Lingus to the retention of the base and of the employees, thereby ensuring Ms Mulholland and her 82 colleagues will not lose their jobs.  My questions are simple. Does the Government need to link future supports to the airline to maintaining those regional bases and employees outside the east coast?

Even though moneys have been given to Shannon Airport and I am not denying that, it still does not attract airlines to the region.  There is only one way that should and can happen.  That is with airline aid under EU state aid.  A section of the Act allows for airline aid.  Airlines such as Aer Lingus should be incentivised to fly routes out of Shannon Airport, which would have a major economic impact on the base and the region.  The more people who come through the airport, the more footfall there is and the more jobs are created.  The way to go is to have airline aid and incentivise the airlines to fly out of Shannon Airport.  If we do not go down that road soon all the money, similar to the water leaking from pipes throughout the country, will leak out somewhere and we will not know where it is.

Just before Covid struck us all, in 2019 Dublin Airport was bursting at the seams.  It was at capacity and unable to put on any more routes or fly any more aircraft in or out of the airport.  It was over capacity with security, immigration and everything else.  Our Customs and border protection, CBP, in Shannon was perfectly right-sized for the number of people going through that airport.  It was a very easy day to go wherever you needed to be, whether you were a business traveller or somebody going on holidays.  I predominantly worked on a Boston flight and the number of businessmen I would have had in my cabin who did not know that Shannon Airport was so close to Galway, Limerick or Kerry would be hard to believe.  If they were going golfing in Adare or if they were going to Old Head, they did not know how close Shannon was to these other places and their travel agent booked them by accident into Shannon because the first thing that came up on all the search engines was Dublin.  Dublin is not the be all and the end all, and I am not anti-Dublin.  There is enough work for everybody.  There is enough airspace for everybody.  There is enough if the will is there to distribute between the three airports and link the three.<\/p><p> I do not care how the Senator links all of this.

That, in itself, as Ms Connolly alluded to earlier, plays on your mind and the mental games that were being played-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Mulholland"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>Were staff given any indication by the airline?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#O00600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621983600,"counter":754,"content":"<p>No.  I am not blaming the airline for this.  What I am saying is, because of the snowballing effect of Covid in itself, nobody knew when we were to fly again but at no stage was Shannon being closed.  I would have made different decisions about my own life but the PUP payment, as far as we were concerned, was a stopgap.  It was a get-out-of-jail free card to keep me and my colleagues going until we rode out this storm.  As there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon, the rug was pulled out from under us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Mulholland"},{"type":"speech","time":1621983600,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for attending today's meeting and engaging with the committee, in particular, Ms Ashley Connolly, F&oacute;rsa national secretary; from the Shannon base, Ms Mary Mulholland and Mr. Gerry Clarke; from the Cork base, Ms Sarah O'Leary of the cabin crew, and Ms Liz Barry and Ms Catriona Jones from the Dublin base.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus will be in before us next Wednesday.  We will be putting those points to Aer Lingus and will take them up with Government.  We are very supportive.  We want to retain the base and the vital staff in Shannon, and equally, in Cork, and we are conscious of Dublin.  This is a matter we will continue to come back to.  What we want to ensure here is that when the international aviation takes off - we would like to see it happening sooner rather than later in Ireland with the digital green certificate - we have all these experienced staff in play to ensure they can continue that vital role they play in bringing business people and tourists in and out of Ireland.  I thank all the witnesses very much for today.  Apologies for being quick on time but it was important we had them here today.<\/p> <p>  The next meeting of the joint committee will be a private meeting at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 June 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052600002#O00800","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621983600,"counter":756,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at  2.47 p.m. until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 June 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
