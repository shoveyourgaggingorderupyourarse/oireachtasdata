The Irish banks have made huge progress in this regard since the height of the crisis. According to the Central Bank of Ireland, the average NPL ratio of the domestic Irish banks was 8.5 % in December 2018, falling from 13.8% a year earlier and from greater than 30% at peak in 2013. In volume terms, NPLs in the domestic Irish banks have now fallen by &euro;67.3 billion, or 88%, from peak in 2013. A major contributor to this has been the almost 127,000 mortgage restructures that are currently in place.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the NPL ratios at the Irish banks remain at an elevated level and are above the European average of under 4% and further work is required by the banks to address this. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale remain unchanged. For example, Start Mortgages and Pepper, the firms who were involved in the Glas and Glenbeigh loan sales transacted by PTSB in 2018, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, assurances have been given that the terms of a restructure agreed before these sales took place will continue to be honoured.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in 2018 I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible.

Under this scenario the UK would need to clarify its intentions regarding whether it still intended to continue making payments towards the current MFF. <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has proposed a number of legislative proposals to prepare for the UK's withdrawal. The EU-level measures are summarised in the European Commission&rsquo;s fourth Brexit Preparedness Communication of 10 April 2019 and includes a measure for the 2019 EU budget, which establishes a legal basis for the UK to continue to both make payments into the EU budget and to access receipts from it for the year 2019.

This is reflected in the fact that with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak) and I am determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant in this case.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to your specific query about considering the establishment of a State regulated insurance company, it is important to be aware that any such company would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of that insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved.\u00a0My concern therefore with such a proposal is that it would simply compound the existing &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of risk within the market by insurers. This in turn could ultimately decrease competition in the\u00a0 market over the longer term, as some insurers may stop insuring particular risks completely if there is a view that a State company is willing to insure these risks instead, particularly those lines of business that are considered to be unprofitable.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing this risk than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially could be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.<\/p>  <p>  In view of these issues, I am not convinced that\u00a0State intervention of the type proposed would be a solution to the current problem regarding the cost or availability of insurance.\u00a0 Instead, I think that we need to continue to implement the recommendations of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900068#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Staff","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[25524\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the appointment of the incoming Governor of the Central Bank will be suspended until all investigations in New Zealand involving them are completed;

The FSPO presents customers with a means of resolving their complaint in an independent, fair and transparent manner that takes account of their unique personal circumstances, through an informal dispute resolution process or formal investigation. <\/p>  <p>  As noted in the Central Bank Tracker Mortgage Examination Redress and Compensation penultimate Update, which was published in February 2019, the Examination has now been completed at the majority of lenders.\u00a0 In the case of the remaining lenders, supervision work continues, as the Central Bank must ensure that the work carried out by lenders is sufficiently rigorous and thorough to have addressed satisfactorily any remaining issues affecting groups of customers and to ensure that all eligible groups of customers are included for redress and compensation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank Governor noted in his opening statement when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 26 March this year that a total of &euro;665 million has so far been provided to impacted customers. This figure includes &euro;47 million for redress and compensation to impacted customers identified outside of the industry wide examination.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s priority at all times throughout the Examination has been to make sure that all affected groups of customers have been identified and remediated.\u00a0 The Government supports the work carried out by the Central Bank and I have been advised by the Bank that a final update on the Tracker Mortgage Examination will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[25437\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the treatment of persons affected by a controversy relating to a bank (details supplied); the level of compensation offered; if he has a role in ensuring that customers receive fair treatment from financial institutions operating here in view of the fact he is a shareholder within the bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>I would remind the Deputy that as Minister for Finance there are strict rules around how I can intervene even in banks in which the State has a shareholding.\u00a0The day to day operations of the banks are the sole\u00a0responsibility of the boards and management teams and each bank must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However this Government has firmly supported the work of the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure that customers receive fair treatment from the financial institutions involved.\u00a0As the Deputy will be aware,\u00a0the industry wide Tracker Mortgage Examination review is the largest, complex and most significant supervisory review in the history of the Central Bank of Ireland in respect to its consumer protection mandate. It has revealed the unacceptable damage that misconduct can cause to consumers up to and including the loss of their homes and properties in some cases. To this end there has been &euro;665 million of redress and compensation issued to customers at end February 2019.<\/p>  <p>  To further support the work and power of the regulator, I am bringing forward the\u00a0Central Bank (amendment) Bill which will introduce an advanced\u00a0Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) which will, in tandem with new enhancements to the fitness and probity regime, help prevent something like the mortgage tracker issue happening again.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has intervened on prevailing rate issues in line with its regulatory engagement via the Examination.

Should they be dissatisfied with any aspect of their redress and compensation offer and can pursue their case based on their own unique circumstances with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank examined AIB&rsquo;s model to determine the then prevailing rate and concluded that based on the information then available, that it was reasonable. In relation to the contractual interpretation of the term &ldquo;prevailing rate&rdquo; the Central Bank formed the view at the time that at a macro level, it could not mount a legal challenge on behalf of all customers in the relevant group, that a rate other than the then prevailing rate should be offered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[25317\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to lift the &euro;500,000 pay cap for workers in the banking sector; the reports he has commissioned on the matter; his further plans to make such reports public; when such reports will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that Government policy on banking remuneration has remained unchanged since the financial crisis.

These\u00a0affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of\u00a0health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the\u00a0most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks.<\/p>  <p>  A new regulatory framework has been put in place since the financial crisis across the EU, the economy has returned to near full employment, the remaining banks are profitable again &ndash; and in the case of AIB and BOI sustainably so. The State remains the largest shareholder in AIB, BOI\u00a0and PTSB\u00a0but following the successful IPO of AIB in June 2017 all three banks are also now on an equal footing with listings on the main market of the Irish and London stock exchanges.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The skill set required in the banking sector is evolving with the greatest demand for staff now in areas such as the digital economy, risk management, legal and compliance.

A fiscal vulnerability exists in the form of an exposure of the public finances to fluctuations in corporation tax receipts, which last year were at their highest ever share of Exchequer revenues at 18.7 percent of overall tax receipts. By way of context VAT and Income Tax receipts accounted for approximately 64 percent of our overall tax receipts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, I have taken steps to broaden our corporation tax base, including through the introduction of the 80 per cent cap on capital allowances for intangible assets in Budget 2018 and the introduction of a broader Exit Tax regime in Budget 2019.\u00a0 Measures have also been introduced in recent years which will ensure a continued broadening of the overall tax base. These include the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, the Local Property Tax and the sugar-sweetened drinks tax. Further measures that I have taken which will enhance the tax base include the increase in the VAT rate, for tourism related goods and services, from the 9 per cent rate to the 13.5 per cent rate in Budget 2019. For 2019 all of these measures are projected to raise revenues equivalent to approximately 1.5 percent of GDP or 5.7 percent of overall general government revenue.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Further steps which I have taken include an increase in the commercial (non-residential) Stamp Duty rate from 2 per cent to 6 per cent in Budget 2018 and an increase in the betting duty levy from 1 per cent to 2 percent in Budget 2019. I have also removed some tax reliefs, such as the Home Renovation Incentive and the Start your own Business Relief, and continued a roll-out of enhanced taxation compliance measures. However, I would note that further potential for base broadening exists, particularly in the environmental area where important policy priorities exist.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing systematic review of tax expenditures, taken in line with my Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines, will assist in this process, through identifying deadweight, resource misallocation and assessing if tax reliefs still meet their initial policy objectives. This will also provide a &lsquo;health check&rsquo; as to whether they accord with the OECD tax hierarchy in terms of their impact upon economic growth. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department will shortly publish\u00a0a paper to highlight some of these in-built vulnerabilities to our tax revenues and to quantify where possible, the impact of a shock to our corporation tax receipts. Potential solutions to this are presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate against this emerging over-reliance. It is my intention to give consideration to these, and possibly other, suggestions with a view to making recommendations to Government in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[25229\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if further to the fiscal assessment report of June 2019 from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, he is examining further measures to broaden the tax base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>I \u00a0can confirm that I and my Department continue to seek ways\u00a0to broaden\u00a0the tax base that do not run contrary to the growth focus of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Certain measures have already been introduced which will ensure a continued broadening of the overall tax base.

I would also note that further potential for base broadening exists, particularly in the environmental area where important policy priorities exist. <\/p>  <p>  Also in Budget 2019 the income tax package was primarily comprised of an increase of &euro;750 in the point of entry to the higher rate of income tax, a reduction in the third rate of USC and an extension of the income range on which the second rate of USC will be charged. This continued the focus on reducing the tax burden on low to middle income earners, while maintaining a broad tax base.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in recent years I have taken steps to broaden and enhance the stability of our corporation tax base, including through the introduction of the 80 per cent cap on capital allowances for intangible assets in Budget 2018 and the introduction of a broader Exit Tax regime in Budget 2019. Given that Ireland has been consistently successful over several decades in attracting leading multi-nationals to base here and given our high level of integration with the global economy, it is not altogether surprising that our corporation tax base has become concentrated.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I would acknowledge that a fiscal vulnerability exists in the form of a significant and growing exposure of the public finances to corporation tax receipts, which last year were at their highest ever share of Exchequer revenues at 18.7 per cent of overall tax receipts. My Department will shortly publish a paper to highlight some of these in-built vulnerabilities and to quantify where possible, the impact of such a shock. Potential solutions to this are presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate against this emerging over-reliance. It is my intention to give consideration to these &ndash; and possibly other suggestions &ndash; with a view to making recommendations to Government in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exchequer Payments","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC05900"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[17779\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900069#WRC06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on Exchequer debt servicing costs for the first quarter of 2019; the way in which the refinancing of Exchequer debt since the beginning of 2018 is impacting on those costs in 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency that Exchequer debt service costs in the first quarter of 2019 were just over &euro;2 billion, a decline of 6.2% on the same period last year.

The extension includes giving the UK flexibility to leave before that date should the Withdrawal Agreement be ratified.\u00a0 The European Council decision made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, cannot be re-negotiated and that any unilateral commitments by the UK Government should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement. We welcome these important assertions. \u00a0The European Council also agreed that should the UK&rsquo;s position on the EU-UK future relationship evolve, the EU is prepared to reconsider the political declaration on the future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains focused on the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement as the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to fully protect the Good Friday Agreement. The decision of the European Council provides the UK with more time, until 31 October, to ensure an orderly withdrawal. However, the risk of a no deal Brexit remains. The preparations for all possible scenarios, that have been taking place since before the Brexit referendum,\u00a0are therefore continuing. Brexit in all scenarios will have negative consequences and as a Government we are determined to be as ready as we can be. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published on 19 December 2018, sets out comprehensive, cross-Government preparations that have been taking place over the last three years. This work continues at both a national and EU level. Last week, on 12th June,\u00a0the Commission issued its fifth Contingency Communication which updates and reinforces the necessary no deal Brexit preparedness measures at EU level. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has been taking key decisions to advance the implementation of our Brexit preparations. The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act, was signed into law by the President on 17 March 2019. The Act complements legal measures at EU level and focuses on measures protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.\u00a0 The Act is primarily intended for a no deal scenario, and most of the Act will not be commenced should the Withdrawal agreement be ratified. The legislation which I proposed in the areas of Taxation and Financial Services is an important part of the whole of Government response to Brexit, as it will ensure continuity of access for business and citizens in relation to certain taxation reliefs and allowances, as well as enabling insurance undertakings to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers, in a no deal scenario. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also taken important steps to prepare our economy, including through dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. My Department is working within the whole-of-Government approach and is coordinating closely with its agencies who are developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. The Central Bank has been working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for end March 2019, and they are now using the extended deadline to further prepare to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible. \u00a0In relation to funding the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit. The Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong. <\/p>  <p>  Within Revenue, there is a very significant program of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing, and trader engagement. Additional physical capacity is in place at ports and airports to apply checks and controls, in a no deal scenario. This work will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate trade to the maximum extent possible in a no deal scenario.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department and its relevant agencies are continuing to work to ensure that they are as prepared as possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, post Brexit. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a Government we will continue to strongly encourage businesses and citizens to do the same. For instance, businesses that trade with the UK should apply now to the Revenue Commissioners for their customs number (EORI). The Government website gov.ie\/Brexit is an important resource in this regard and contains information on a range of Brexit supports and advice, as well as an overview of the institutions offering financial assistance to businesses such as the SBCI, Microfinance Ireland, Intertrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Insurance Cover Provision","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[17987\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tangible steps his Department has taken to provide flood insurance to those properties located in areas with demountable flood defences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept Consequently neither the Government, nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II directive).<\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (\"CFRAM\") Programme which focusses on 300 Areas for Further Assessment identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans which sets out current flood relief schemes, including 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties. <\/p>  <p>  The Government believes that its existing policy in relation to flooding, which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach, is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by the OPW and Local Authorities capital investment programme, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This arrangement has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas. For instance,\u00a0the Insurance Ireland survey in March 2019 of approximately 87% of the property insurance market in Ireland, \u00a0indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 95% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 74% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover. In addition, it should be noted that an Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group shares relevant data on completed flood defence schemes and a sub-group has been established to explore the technical arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to demountable defences my Department is continuing to examine how to increase the level of cover in areas with demountable defences. One of the outcomes of these discussions is that the insurance industry has now acknowledged that they accept that the demountable defences meet the desired &lsquo;1:100 year&rsquo; standard. However, while demountable defences are effective when correctly deployed they are dependent on human intervention which increases the risk of failure. This is a difficult and complex issue to resolve but every effort being made to get a more responsive approach from the insurance industry on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Claims","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[25567\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress in developing legislation that would oblige insurance companies to inform motor insurance policyholders of claims made against them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>My Department is currently working on developing legislative changes that would oblige insurance companies to inform policyholders of claims made against them.

Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this also falls into the regime regardless of the level of property held. Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax acts.<\/p>  <p>  The Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) framework was introduced in 2013, to facilitate long-term, risk-diversified, collective investment in rental property. The rules relating to REITs\u00a0in Ireland are found in Part 25A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In order to be a REIT, a company must be listed on the main market of an EU stock exchange within three years of forming, and it must be widely held. Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. As such, their income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits to their shareholders each year.\u00a0A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other business (i.e. non-property business) that\u00a0it carries on. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Dividend withholding tax at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds\u00a0and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the tax regimes applicable to REITs and IREFs, however given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis.

The overall objective is to encourage the Member States to increase their growth potential by continuing to improve their economies and further strengthening their economic resilience.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard I welcome the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s Country Specific Recommendations for Ireland. While one of these recommendations calls on Ireland to continue to take action on addressing aggressive tax planning, it is notable that Commissioner Moscovici has publicly acknowledged that we are on the right track and encouraged us to continue in this direction.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s actions in recent years have demonstrated our clear commitment to taking action to address aggressive tax planning. Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap, which was published last September, set out a clear range of actions which Ireland is taking on corporate tax reform. Significant actions have already been taken on foot on the Roadmap including the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, amendments to Ireland&rsquo;s exit tax rules, and the prompt ratification of the BEPS Multilateral Instrument. Further actions will be taken in Finance Bill 2019 including the amendment of Ireland&rsquo;s transfer pricing rules and the introduction of anti-hybrid rules.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a very open economy which serves as a key European base for a significant number of non-EU headquartered multinational companies, it is to be fully expected that Ireland would have a higher percentage of outbound royalty payments than other Member States.\u00a0 Concerns about outbound payments are justified in circumstances where the relevant profits should in fact be taxed in the EU or where the profits are ultimately being untaxed (either in the recipient or parent jurisdiction).\u00a0 It is my belief that neither of these concerns should arise in respect of outbound payments from Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The international consensus is that profits should be taxed where the &lsquo;DEMPE&rsquo; functions occur. In this regard, Member States have the ability to tax the profits attributable to those functions within their jurisdiction under the international corporation tax framework.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the outbound payments made from Ireland are made by companies which are ultimately owned by companies resident and taxable in the United States. It is my understanding that reforms introduced by the US in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 should make it impossible for any such royalties to avoid tax in the US even if they are not paid to the US directly and are not taxed in the recipient jurisdiction.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For these reasons I believe that the actions set out in the Roadmap are appropriate with regard to addressing aggressive tax planning but, as always, I will continue to keep the situation under review and shall act accordingly as circumstances demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Staff","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[24049\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he or his officials have been monitoring the developments in New Zealand regarding the outgoing Governor of the Central Bank there.","asker":"1283","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[24324\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the inquiry into the leak of the New Zealand Government budget recently.","asker":"1283","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[25495\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900070#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the appointment of the new Governor of the Central Bank; if he has been in contact with his counterpart in New Zealand; the timeline for the completion of the investigation there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 77 and 79 together.<\/p><p>The New Zealand State Services Commissioner is carrying out an investigation into the unauthorised access of New Zealand Budget material and the events surrounding it.

Several Member States have made clear that their Governments do not support any proposed change to how tax decisions are made at European level. <\/p>  <p>  As EU partners, the United Kingdom and Ireland have traditionally shared similar views on the broader tax issue of harmonisation and on proposals such as the proposed directive for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.  While Brexit will result in the loss of an important ally on these matters, Ireland will not be isolated as a number of other countries have similar views to us. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a significant impact on Ireland, and requires planning by Government, business and citizens, as well as at the EU level. Our planning at home and at the EU level for all possible outcomes will continue. The Department of Finance and other Government Departments and key Agencies have been preparing for Brexit for three years now &ndash; and we continue to do so, through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. Last week (on 12 June) the Commission issued its fifth Contingency Communication which updates and reinforces the necessary no deal Brexit preparedness measures at EU level. <\/p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of Brexit, Ireland will remain in the EU with all the stability and certainty that membership brings, including access to the Single Market of over 500 million people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900071#WRE07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900071#WRE07500"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[25838\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900071#WRE07600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which economic performance here compares with other countries within the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[25847\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900071#WRE07700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which he remains satisfied regarding the economic performance of Ireland when compared to other countries throughout and outside Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 112 together.<\/p><p>As published in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019, my Department has forecast economic growth to moderate to a more sustainable rate of 3.9 per cent in 2019, and to continue at the broadly similar pace of 3.3 per cent for 2020. Although growth rates have moderated from 2018, they still compare very favourably to other EU, and significant non-EU, trading partners.<\/p><p>As a barometer of how well our economy is performing, there is no story more positive than the one emanating from our labour market, where we saw full time employment growth of almost 3 per cent in 2018. More people are working in Ireland than ever before and the unemployment rate, at 4.4 per cent, is significantly lower than that of other Euro Area countries.<\/p><p>Growth in the Irish economy is expected to come from both modified domestic demand, which is set to increase by 4.0 per cent in 2019, and an expansion in Irish exports &ndash; which are set to grow by 5.2 per cent this year. Modified domestic demand excludes the volatile components of investment spending &ndash; giving a more accurate picture of the health of domestic economic activity.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s economic data compare favourably to those of our main trading partners &ndash; with growth, unemployment, and inflation performing better than the Euro Area and EU averages - as the data in Table 1 below illustrate. The European Commission Spring 2019 forecasts, published in May, show that the pace of expansion in the Euro Area, the EU and the US is expected to ease. For the Euro Area, the Commission is forecasting growth of 1.2 per cent this year, strengthening slightly to 1.5 per cent in 2020.  Growth in the US economy will slow but remain relatively strong at 2.4 per cent for 2019, easing further to 1.9 per cent in 2020. In common with Ireland, unemployment continues to fall in the EU and US, with the US labour market set to tighten further as it approaches full employment. In the UK, unemployment will remain stable as employment growth slows in the context of subdued GDP figures. <\/p><p>The comparatively low level of inflation in Ireland should help to maintain our competitiveness and protect real wage growth. The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the second most competitive country in the EU and the seventh most competitive country in the world.

This interest rate varied considerably across countries, with the average for the euro area being 1.70%.

It is a matter for each credit institution to set its own lending and deposit rates having regard to cost and competitive considerations and also to make its own lending decisions.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a number of factors contribute to the differential between Irish mortgage rates and those in other countries including the relatively large historical loss experience in the Irish market during the financial crisis and the related legacy issues of non-performing loans. In Ireland there is a relatively high level of non-performing loans in the banking system. Banks are required to make adequate provisions for such loans.<\/p><p>Banks are also required to hold an adequate level of capital against mortgage lending. These capital requirements are calculated with reference to historical loss and default rates. The high levels of mortgage default experienced by Irish banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis mean that Irish banks are required to hold relatively more capital for new mortgage lending than many of their European peers, in some cases substantially more capital.  <\/p><p>In addition to their capital requirements banks are also required to build up additional capital to meet regulatory capital buffers such as the countercyclical capital buffer which is intended to ensure banks can withstand future adverse economic shocks.<\/p><p>The impact of these capital requirements is reflected in the interest rates charged for mortgages in Ireland.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, the Irish banking system continues to hold a large amount of lower yielding tracker mortgages on their balance sheets and there is currently a high level of concentration in the market for new mortgage credit.  <\/p><p>As I have mentioned before, the Central Bank has introduced a number of changes to the Consumer Protection Code that are designed to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments; for example, provision 6.5 (g) of the Code now requires lenders at least annually to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, notify their variable interest (other than tracker) mortgage customers whether they can move to a cheaper interest rate as a result of a change in their loan to value interest rate band and, if the customer is permitted to move, to invite the borrower to contact the lender to discuss the matter.  If the consumer is not permitted to move to a lower loan to value band with a lower interest rate, the consumer is nevertheless to be notified that he\/she may be able to avail of a lower loan to value interest rate band from another lender based on an up to-date valuation of the property.  It should also be noted that the Central Bank macro prudential loan to value and loan to income residential mortgage lending restrictions do not apply to switcher mortgages. More generally, the Code also requires lenders at least annually to provide to variable rate (excluding tracker) mortgage holders:-<\/p><p>- a summary of other mortgage products offered by that lender which could provide savings for the consumer at that point in time,<\/p><p>- a statement that consumers should keep their mortgage arrangements under review as there may be other options that could provide savings for the borrower and<\/p><p>- a link to the relevant section of the Competition and Consumer Protection website relating to mortgage switching or changing mortgage type<\/p><p>(<i><\/i>). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900072#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900072#WRF00700"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[25844\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900072#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he can put in place to create an economic environment favourable to young persons seeking to acquire a home for the first time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance published updated macroeconomic forecasts with the Stability Programme Update (SPU) in April.

A suite of key reforms has been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040 and its objectives including:<\/p><p>- The establishment of a Construction Sector Group to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector; <\/p><p>- A Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board consisting of Departmental Secretaries General that meets regularly to ensure effective leadership of the implementation process;<\/p><p>- The establishment of an Investment Projects and Programmes Office in my Department to coordinate reporting on the plan and to drive reforms, including strengthened business case and project appraisal;<\/p><p>- The publication of a Capital Projects tracker to inform citizens about projects in their areas and to give a greater overview to the construction sector; <\/p><p>- A Capability Review of public sector bodies is being undertaken by my Department to ensure that the State&rsquo;s delivery practices are of the highest standard; and <\/p><p>- As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is reviewing the Public Spending Code. The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.  <\/p><p>These reforms are designed to support public bodies as they work to achieve value for money and to maximise outcomes from investment in public capital infrastructure.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, projections for general government revenue and expenditure beyond 2023 have not yet been compiled.  However, Project Ireland 2040 does set out the national spending envelope up to 2027, allocated to each National Strategic Outcome to ensure that Project Ireland 2040 objectives can be pursued in the light of the expected funding allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900072#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures Data","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900072#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[25664\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900072#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of whistleblower complaints in his Department since the legislation was introduced in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has protected disclosures procedures in place that have been developed in line with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and agreed upon by the Management Board.

There has been a 67% increase between 2014, the last year of operation for the operation for the previous legislation, and 2017.  It is expected that the Information Commissioner's next annual report will show that the number of requests in 2018 exceeded the 33,979 received by civil and public sector organisations in 2017 as part of a consistent upward trend.  This continuing increase in demand may be seen both as a measure of the legislation's success and a significant challenge for public bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, the Central Policy Unit for Freedom of Information at my Department has continued to work closely with stakeholders throughout the civil and public service with a view towards improving FOI practice.  Our aim is  to ensure that requesters' objectives are met by the most efficient possible means, while building capacity both in terms of technical knowledge, but also an appreciation of the broader significance of this legislation for the business of their organisations.  In addition, the Central Policy Unit liaises closely with the Office of the Information Commissioner as well as members of the public, providing guidance and advice on making the most of the FOI system through its help-desk service.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Policy Unit is currently at an advanced stage of the tender process for a revised FOI training framework.  Over 9,000 participants have received training under the previous framework.

The intention is to move beyond the testimonial and anecdotal evidence we have that projects work well and provide a good service, to capture precisely what specific interventions work best, document this evidence, and roll out learning across all the projects over a period of years. The actions will include:<\/p><p>- examination of what makes for a successful relationship between a young participant and a Youth Justice Worker (success being understood as facilitation of real change in the young person&rsquo;s attitudes and life that would not otherwise happen);<\/p><p>- articulating the contribution that a GYDP makes in tackling crime in a community; and<\/p><p>- assessment of the contribution that &lsquo;up-stream&rsquo; agencies and interventions can make to crime reduction and making appropriate recommendations.<\/p><p>Furthermore, I am chairing an expert Steering Group to guide the development of a new Youth Justice Strategy. One of the areas the group is examining is diversion from the Justice System. This will include looking at  how we can enhance the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and the GYDPs which act to support it. <\/p><p>All of this work will help to further develop and enhance, over time and as resources allow, the approach to the location of new projects, with the objective of ensuring that the GYDP service is available in all areas of the State.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>GARDA

matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":345,"content":"<p>The statistics sought by the Deputy are contained in the annual reports of the Committee set up under section 44 of the Children Act 2001 to monitor the effectiveness of the Garda Diversion Programme.These reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and available to members in the Library.  They are also published online at <i><\/i>.  All youth crime cases are required to be sent to the Garda Diversion Office for consideration and the statistics for each year, broken down by Garda District, are set out in the annual report for that year.  Figures for 2018 are not available yet, but will be available when the 2018 report is published later this year.  The 2019 statistics and report will be available in the course of 2020. <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that crime prevention and investigation, including in relation to the involvement of children in crime, are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance. My Department is committed to supporting them in this regard.That being said, I am committed to tackling youth crime and my department is taking a number of different steps to address the number of youth offences being committed. <\/p><p>An important initiative in that regard is the <b>&quot;<\/b>Greentown&quot; project, a research project led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with UL which is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also by my own Department. Its specific focus is on examining the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt this. <\/p><p>In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. This new &quot;Greentown Programme&quot; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. <\/p><p>I understand that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, during 2019. <\/p><p>More generally, I am currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy with the assistance of an interdepartmental and interagency steering group. The new Strategy will address the full range of issues relevant to youth justice, including how best to tackle the serious issues raised in the Deputy's Question. <\/p><p>A key issue here is how to ensure an integrated approach across all agencies, but in particular the relevant child welfare programmes, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and schools, to ensure a sustained and holistic response and that integrated services are provided to respond to the situation of children at risk, tailored to the individual child in the context of the specific family and the specific community and the issues they face. The new Youth Justice Strategy will be published in draft form for a further round of public consultation before the end of this year and will be finalised early in 2020. <\/p><p>My Department also provides funding through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs). These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime\/anti-social behaviour. <\/p><p>For 2019, IYJS has a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community. This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11. The Department also supports pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as mentoring initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900073#WRG05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Youth Diversion Projects","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900073#WRG05700"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[25751\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900073#WRG05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps which have been taken following the issues outlined in January 2019 in the Garda interim report of the Commissioner on youth crime cases from 2010 to 2017; the steps taken to address the shortcomings highlighted in the Garda youth diversion programme in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p> As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner has given detailed information in relation to this matter when it was examined publicly by the Policing Authority and by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously confirmed,  the publication of information in relation to the more detailed aspects of the Garda Review will be a matter for the Commissioner and the Policing Authority.

The deployment of the National Broadband Plan network is currently to provide access to high speed broadband to circa 540,000 premises across the State. The relevant premises are identified by Eircode and are represented as AMBER on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. It is open to the Department within the NBP contract to increase or decrease the scope of the contract post-contract award where it is considered necessary to do so, for example to ensure on-going compliance with State Aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan procurement process was run on a technology neutral basis and sought to elicit the best technical solution from participating bidders to address the market failure identified and deliver on the minimum technical specifications set down in the tender documents. In line with State Aid Guidelines, the solution proposed by the successful Bidder was based on the maximum reuse of existing infrastructure to the greatest extent possible, which under the final tender provided involves deployment of new fibre cable over existing eir poles and through existing eir ducts, as well as some new build where no existing infrastructure exists. <\/p>  <p>  The solution proposed at final tender was subject to a robust evaluation and was found to have met all the requirements set out since 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The network design put forward at final tender met and in some areas exceeded the minimum technical specifications set down in the tender requirements, including the requirement to provide concrete commitments around how the network will be future proofed to meet end user demand over at least the next 25 years.

While all publicly funded construction projects must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure cost certainty, value for money and financial accountability, my Department has streamlined the nine stages of review in the Framework, to just four for social housing construction projects.<\/p>  <p>  My Department   engages continuously with local authorities, including through the City and County Management Association (CCMA), on the various work processes associated with the delivery of housing projects, in line with Rebuilding Ireland commitments.  A review carried out jointly between my Department and the CCMA identified more precise target timelines for developing new social housing construction projects, including an overall target of 59 weeks from an initial proposal being brought forward, to placing the construction contract and starting on site.  This timeline compares favourably with private sector construction projects.<\/p>  <p>  The bulk of this time is assigned to the completion of essential local authority work in project design, developing costings and specifications, undertaking planning through the Part 8 process and the procurement of contractors; the time allotted to my Department for funding approvals is a small portion of the overall time involved.  In addition, projects are advanced in such a way as to allow other work to continue during the approval stages. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s engagement with the CCMA and with individual local authorities has also seen improvements around single-stage project approvals for smaller scale projects and in relation to rapid build projects. Communications on construction proposals have also been enhanced through quarterly technical meetings, which are held between individual local authorities and my Department.  Constructive input has been received from local authorities in identifying and implementing these process improvements and in working with my Department through the quarterly meetings, and in other fora, to review progress in respect of social housing projects and to clear any blockages as swiftly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  These arrangements demonstrate the Government's commitment to the accelerated delivery of new housing. My Department has no interest in unnecessarily prolonging the time involved in these approvals, other than to ensure compliance with Government-wide rules for capital project oversight.  We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that projects are progressed efficiently, while also delivering high quality design and good value for money, in sustainable communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900077#WRM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures Data","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900077#WRM03400"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[25662\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061900077#WRM03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of whistleblower complaints in his Department since the legislation was introduced in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
