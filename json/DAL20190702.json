It potentially signals the death knell of a sector that has suffered unduly in recent times as a result of the collapse in beef prices, the impact of Brexit and increasing pressures arising from the climate change issue.  Among the farming organisations, the president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, described the trade agreement as \"reckless\" and \"wrong\" and the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, said it was an \"absolute disgrace\" and \"beggars belief\" that millions of acres of rainforest will be chopped down to facilitate beef expansion, while sustainable, fully traceable beef in Europe is put to the sword.  I put it to the Minister that this trade agreement is in many ways outdated.  It is outdated in that it ignores the impact of Brexit on the beef sector, both now and into the future.  It is outdated in not taking due note of the collapse in beef prices in recent years and the difficulty the sector is facing.  Above all, it is outdated in terms of the climate change issue.  It beggars belief that this trade agreement has been signed given the change of mindset around climate change across Europe, including in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government seems to be quietly acquiescing to this trade deal.  The Minister will recall that during the local elections, the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, announced a &euro;50 million package and the Government and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, took credit for what we were led to believe were very close dealings between the Commissioner and the Government.  At the time, there did not appear to be any conditions attached.<\/p><p>We subsequently learned from documentation published last week that there are significant conditions attached, one key condition being that the measures taken by Ireland shall be aimed at reducing production or restructuring the beef and veal sector along with other objectives.  We have this incredibly contradictory position whereby beef is being allowed into Europe which is being produced in an environmentally unsustainable way, while at the same time Europe is putting a condition on compensating Irish farmers around reducing beef production.  In today's <i>Irish Independent <\/i>oped, Commissioner Hogan talks about how he would invite governments to do an environmental assessment, which is incredible.  Why in the name of God did he and others not do an environmental assessment?  I would point out to him the recent report from the BBC World Service indicating that the Trump of the tropics, President Bolsonaro, is accelerating rapidly the deforestation of Brazil and of the Amazon.  There is only one conclusion.  The BBC World Service report was aided by officials in the government of Brazil who are absolutely appalled with what is going on there.  An area the size of a football pitch is being cleared every single minute, with devastating consequences for the world in terms of the climate change agenda and global warming.  The response of Europe is to reward climate change deniers, essentially, and people who pay no heed to it, particularly President Bolsonaro, through this Mercosur trade deal, while hurting beef farmers who are among the most efficient in the world in terms of environmental production models and methodology.  Does the Government accept that this is environmentally unsustainable as a trade deal?  What strategy does it intend to deploy to deal with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562072700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  There is no doubt that it is of very significant concern.  The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach, along with the President of France and the Prime Minister of Poland, made a very strong case even very recently.  Ireland has been consistently raising this, indeed as far back as when I was Minister with responsibility for trade, and that goes back quite some time.  This was an issue of very significant concern then and Irish Ministers never lost the opportunity to raise it.  The original proposal sought 300,000 tonnes of beef and that would certainly have been devastating in its impact.  The agreement we now have, which is only an agreement at principle level, provides for 99,000 tonnes of beef, 45% of which will be frozen.  In addition, there are very clear statements that there can be absolutely no compromise on food standards that apply within the European Union markets.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing that needs to be borne in mind, which is why the Taoiseach says we need a proper evaluation of the proposed deal at this stage, is that there are other benefits in it for Ireland.  It includes 45,000 tonnes in the dairy sector and it includes many other sectors in which we have companies such as medical devices, pharma, chemicals, and food opportunities.  Those sectors will see gains to be had in this.  While the Deputy has remarked on the situation we face with Brexit as raising particular concerns, it also underlines the importance for small open economies like our own to have access to markets, particularly growth markets where we can look to the future to build opportunities.  Another reason the evaluation will be important is that, contrary to what Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is suggesting, the deal requires parties to subscribe to the Paris Agreement.  It also includes specific issues around forest sustainability within these countries, so there are significant elements of environmental protection, and protection in respect of labour law and respect for international agreements such as that of the International Labour Organization.  We need to take the time to evaluate this as a whole, as the Taoiseach has said.  We have made our position abundantly clear throughout the very long negotiations that have taken place on it.<\/p><p>We will continue to press those concerns.  We need to undertake that evaluation and look at how to deal with it as it unfolds.  Finalising the legal documentation will take a number of years and there will be a phasing period, over six years, in the context of implementation.  We need to draw back.  While we understand fully the concern of beef farmers, we need to evaluate it in the round and continue to press Ireland's very strong case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200004#B00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562073000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Minister might answer the question asked.

This is a trade deal where, over a very long period, Irish Government Ministers have stridently sought to reduce the originally sought 300,000 tonnes of beef from entering the European market.  We have made that case consistently and we continue to be of the view that the 99,000 tonnes is a threat to our industry.  However, we need to look at this agreement in the round.  While the Deputy refuses to recognise this, it does contain significant opportunities for Irish workers and, indeed, for Irish farmers in the dairy sector.  It also, for the first time, locks in countries with which we trade to principles, such as subscription to the Paris Agreement, which, as the Deputy knows, is the agreement that provides binding obligations on countries to tackle climate change.  This is a new type of trade deal that locks in countries which are participating and which want access to our markets to those sorts of commitments.  It also provides very strong protections in respect of food standards.  I know many people, including farmers, have concerns that substandard products would be allowed into European markets under these agreements.  Those are very strongly protected within the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Irish Government position, the Deputy has probably heard the Taoiseach outline that he will undertake an evaluation of this deal and he has reserved his position until that evaluation is done, something Deputies in this House do not seem willing to do.  There are checks and balances, and that is true of every trade deal.  I have never seen a trade deal come before this House where certain parties, including the Deputy&rsquo;s party, would be stridently opposed to it but, nonetheless, trade agreements such as these have opened opportunities for Irish business.  I have been on trade missions with Irish companies where we have had the chance to take advantage of that and to move away from our dependence on markets like Britain to having a more diverse base of trading relationships.<\/p><p>This is really important to a small open trading economic like ours.  We need to step back.  We recognise that there are threats to a very important sector here.  We need to use the timeframe between now and final ratification of the deal to examine it and make our case in a cogent way, because these documents have to be drawn up in detail.  <\/p> <p> My understanding as to whether the D&aacute;il will have a role is that that depends on the legal interpretation of whether this is a mixed agreement or purely a trade agreement.

However, the policy is not working because the Government's limit of a 4% annual rise in rent is far too high.<\/p><p>I said that when this was first introduced and it is still the case.  The Government is engaged in Celtic tiger economics.  It is totally removed from the reality facing most working people in this country.  Rather than capping rents, the policy has given a signal to landlords to increase rents by 4% every year.  They expect that every other landlord is increasing rents and so think that they should too.  We now have rent inflation of 4% within the rent pressure zones and rents outside the zones are facing even greater increases because they take the 4% as the low benchmark.  The European Central Bank has a target to ensure that inflation remains low within the euro area.  The target is close to 2% over the medium term.  This is not optional.  It is set down as fixed European monetary policy and is binding for eurozone countries.  If monetary policy has a 2% ceiling for inflation, how can the Government justify 4% annual inflation for controlled rents within its power which pushes non-controlled rent up even higher?  This is clearly unsustainable.<\/p> <p> The economy would have to see a year-on-year decline or marginal growth of most other costs to average out to the 2% that we are bound to have under the set eurozone monetary policy.  Does the Government expect everybody else to help it to meet its binding target as it pushes up rents for renters across the country?  There is no evidence that other inflation pressures are not also increasing.  Wages are not growing at this 4% level.  Affordability should surely be the benchmark of what is affordable for people and what is allowable for rent increases.  We see thousands of people being pushed out of the rental sector and into homelessness because of this policy.  Average annual earnings for full-time workers grew by 1.7% between 2016 and 2017.  The national minimum wage, which the Government controls, has grown by less than 1.5% since July 2011.  Will the Government undertake to raise wages to meet this notional 4% target or will it set rents properly at just 1% for three years to allow people to be able to catch up with rent increases and to be able to afford to stay in their own homes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200007#E02500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562074500,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this because the protection of rent pressure zones has been extended today to 19 new areas, including Athlone, Dundalk, Trim, Waterford, Limerick, Gorey, Arklow and several other places.

It provides new powers to ensure that these are respected, such as criminal sanctions against those who fail to respect them and stronger powers for the Residential Tenancies Board to sanction and investigate landlords.  The legislation has helped to make rent pressure zones a more effective tool.  Deputy Howlin will recognise that the key to the issue is increasing supply.  It was the collapse of the housing market that led to the economic crisis that occurred here, with excessive borrowing for an excessive level of housing.  That model cannot be restored.  We have to rebuild a new model on a sustainable basis.  The evidence from the last years is that, year-on-year, we have expanded the supply of social homes which will reach 10,000 this year, supported tenancies in which an additional 17,000 families will be supported this year, and private sector building which has to continue.<\/p><p>The sorts of initiatives that are at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland programme, such as having its own Land Development Agency to put together sites and drive supply and having infrastructural investment and funding tools to put in the hands of those who will build the houses, are important to deliver the supply deficit that we face.  Unfortunately, until we overcome the supply deficit, the weakest people in the market will have difficulties.  We must bridge the supply as well as continuing to support the social investments that we are making.<\/p> <p> That is the long-term solution.  Rent pressure zones have a place but they are not the long-term solution, which is about ensuring that the market can again provide enough housing for the supply.

How can it be right?  If we accept what the Minister said in terms of the supply having to come up to meet demand, we must have an interim proposal to hold people in affordable rent.  That means having a cap on rent increases, as my party suggested, until the supply comes into balance.  The cap should at least be linked to the increase in wages across the State.

This is at a time when Ireland produces the best beef in the world.  The Minister can have no doubt about that.  There are no hormones, full traceability and the highest of production standards.  Irish beef is an excellent product.  Our farmers are doing their best, yet at the same time they cannot make a proper profit on it.  What is being proposed does not make sense.  We in Ireland are being told to cut our stock of animals and plant trees.  At the same time, the Mercosur deal is being done with countries that do not have the same level of traceability or production standards and they are felling thousands of acres of rainforest to raise the beef they want to trade into our economies.<\/p><p>What is being proposed is crazy.<\/p> <p> I want to give the Minister some hard facts.  Today cattle prices are between &euro;3.65 and &euro;3.75 per kg.  Heifers might be worth 10 cent more.  In today's money, it should be &euro;4.30 per kg coming off grass just to barely break even and pay bills.  The Government is leaving our farmers down by not being outraged and fighting.  We have a Taoiseach who said the other day that he could perhaps envisage a situation in which the Government might support the deal.  I do not see how any Minister or backbencher could stand over that statement.  To do so would be letting our farming community and economy down.  It would go down in history as what I would consider a fairly bad decision.  Having said that, it is the Taoiseach - I hate talking about somebody when he is not here - who came out with the statement that he was going to save Ireland by reducing his own meat intake.  I cannot understand for the life of me how any person representing Ireland, a Taoiseach, as he is supposed to be for all of Ireland, could come out with such a statement.<\/p> <p> When there was a backlash over the past couple of days over what the Taoiseach said, the Government said it would support and encourage an economic assessment.  I will tell you what an economic assessment is.  Leave your ivory towers and go out and ask any farmer trying to produce beef, make a profit and keep the family farm open about an economic assessment and he or she will say he or she cannot make money as matters stand, before the deal.  One can imagine what this deal will mean to such farmers and their families.<\/p> <p> Let me ask the Minister about the &euro;100 million cattle deal or beef deal being discussed.  This is nothing more than a smokescreen because the farmer on the ground has got nothing, is getting nothing and probably will get nothing.  If the Mercosur deal goes ahead, the land will not be stocked and our farmers will get poorer and poorer until they are driven out of existence.

I have consistently acknowledged, and the Taoiseach acknowledges, that the key Irish concern was associated with beef.  Under the original proposal, 300,000 tonnes of beef would have come in from the Mercosur countries.  The proposal that has emerged is based on 99,000 tonnes.  Some 45,000 tonnes of that are frozen.  One of the main concerns of Irish farmers is that premium cuts would be coming in.  The decrease has helped to offer protection in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Another concern of Irish farmers is that the beef would be hormone beef or beef from cattle raised according to standards that would not meet European food standards.  The European standards will not be diluted one jot and that has been nailed absolutely solidly into the agreement.  All those standards have to be met if the Mercosur countries are to enter the European markets.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy represents a county that has not only beef but also dairy so he will know there are opportunities in the dairy sector under this deal.  I do not believe Deputies could yet have had the opportunity to evaluate the various elements of this agreement.  There are opportunities as well as threats and we need to use the time, between now and when the deal will finally go to the Council of trade Ministers, to go through the issues, raise specific concerns, carry out the necessary evaluations, consider, if necessary, any concerns over environmental standards, and ensure that in policing this agreement we will hold Brazil and other countries to the highest standards under the Paris Agreement, with which the trade agreement seeks compliance.  We need to use this agreement to see that some of the benefits we are trying to achieve are realised and that any threats to our sector are minimised.<\/p>  <p>  On the next Common Agricultural Policy, we all know the new policy will very decisively reward farmers for very high standards and improve them.  It will be looking towards better methods of handling manures and fertilisers and rewarding farmers.

Let us not forget that in countries such as China there has been major growth in interest in and demand for beef.  If we have a premium product and if we possess the highest possible credentials, then we can avail of opportunities in particular countries while also continuing to trade with those with which we already have trading agreements.

There is a range of supplementary figures going right back to the start of the HSE that I could put on the record of the House.  The indications are that performance so far this year is better than last year and, as the Deputy has acknowledged, significant efforts are under way on the part of the HSE and the new CEO, Paul Reid, to manage available resources effectively.  The HSE&rsquo;s latest income and expenditure position at 30 April 2019 shows a revenue deficit of &euro;116.2 million, which represents 2.3% of the available budget.  The main drivers of the deficit are acute hospitals; the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in other words, the medical card and demand-led schemes; disability services; and the treatment abroad scheme.  Current gross expenditure on the Health Vote, year to date, is 6.8% higher than the same period in 2018.  This compares with an overall increase in the Health Estimate compared to the 2018 outturn of 5.8%.  This House budgeted for the health service to spend roughly 5.8% more this year than last year and the health service bill is, I think, so far 6.8% more.  It is within a percentage point of what this House has budgeted.<\/p>  <p>  Encouragingly and importantly, significant savings are profiled later in the year in line with the targets set out in the national service plan.<\/p><p>I have heard this misrepresented on many occasions in recent weeks.  When the service plan was being drawn up, the HSE was asked - and instructed - as is the norm in most health services, including the UK's NHS, to put a saving's plan in place.  On the basis of current trends, however, there would still be a significant challenge.  This is a matter of concern for the Government.  My Department is working with the HSE to continue to obtain further clarity on the projected year-end position and to mitigate the deficit insofar as is possible.  We are working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not yet have a projected year-end figure.  I support Mr. Paul Reid, the new CEO of the executive, in his calls for people to live within their budgets and to come in on budget.  I will share any further information with Deputy Donnelly when I have it.<\/p> <p> I have emphasised to the HSE and its new board the need to address health spending urgently by means of the following measures: steps to ensure compliance with the staffing limits for 2019 - in other words, to hire more but only within budget; a reporting and monitoring structure around agreed savings targets in the national service plan, with responsible managers providing a monthly report; and a mid-year review of the HSE's performance on savings and staffing limits.  In addition, the establishment on Friday last of a new HSE board governance structure with strong competencies across key areas will further contribute to strengthening the oversight and performance of the HSE pending its further reorganisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200018#Q03200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562080500,"counter":295,"content":"<p>If I heard him correctly, the Minister gave a figure of &euro;116 million for the period to the end of April.

I will get the clarification for the Deputy on these 125 WTEs and how many are on the specialist register.  I do not have that information with me.<\/p>  <p>  In the five years to the end of May, the number has increased by 533 - more than 20% - and now stands at 3,121 consultants working in the Irish health service.

A range of factors have been identified as contributing to the recruitment and retention challenge, of which pay is a part.  I hope the Deputy will recognise that because I understand that in 2012 she wanted to cap consultants' pay and specifically referenced reducing their  pay in a policy document.  Research published last year by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, also identified excessive service demands and the quality and consistency of training as critical challenges; so it is about pay but not just pay.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of new entrant pay is being addressed in general terms under the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 and has been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission.

Over the same period the number of people receiving PA services has increased by approximately 480 to 2,535.<\/p><p>The PA works on a one-to-one basis in the home and the community with a person with a physical or sensory disability.  A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the service user in planning and agreeing the type and the times when support is provided to them.  Supporting independent living must enhance the person's control over his or her own life.<\/p><p>Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that disabled people should live where they wish and with whom they wish, should enjoy a range of community support services including personal assistance, should enjoy community life and its opportunities on an equal basis to non-disabled people and should not be subject to isolation or segregation.  The PA service provided by the HSE adheres to these principles.<\/p><p>In the normal course of service delivery, an individual's requirements are constantly reviewed to ensure services meet changing need.  An individual's personal assistant hours may be adjusted following a service review where demand can result in one individual's hours being reduced to address priority needs of other people with disabilities within that community. <\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>This much needed flexibility gives local community healthcare organisations the freedom to target personal assistant hours to maximum effect within their area. <\/p><p>Beyond the clear policy and operational arrangements which I have outlined and which facilitate the availability of appropriate and growing levels of personal assistant support, I have no plans for legislation governing the rights, entitlements and operations associated with this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200021#T00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1562081700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response but he did not say whether or not he believes in the right to personal assistance.  As the Minister of State is aware, in 2017 almost 85% of people in receipt of personal assistance services received less than three hours service per day.  We have heard that some people receive as little as 40 minutes assistance per day, such that there is hardly time to get breakfast, showered and dressed to go to work or to an appointment.  Some people are in receipt of a very little amount of time.  We know the realities of this.  Dr. Cathal Morgan sent me an excellent reply on foot of my question to the Minister, Deputy Harris, on this matter, in which he set out the small increases over the years which the Minister of State outlined in his reply but he did not deny the fact that the funding for personal assistance has not increased since 2008.  For 11 years, including the three during which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has been in office, there has been no increase in funding in this area.  The reality is that a right to personal assistance is not being delivered.  Joan Carthy of the Irish Wheelchair Association, who the Minister of State and I know, made the point that even with the additional 170,000 hours provided last year there are still a wide range of citizens who are not getting the personal assistance rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200021#T00800","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1562081700,"counter":328,"content":"<p>On the rights issue, as the Deputy knows, I am the person who ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200021#T00900","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1562081700,"counter":329,"content":"<p>The protocol has not been ratified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200021#T01000","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1562081700,"counter":330,"content":"<p>----which many people on the Opposition benches talked about doing for over 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200021#T01100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1562081700,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The protocol has not been ratified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200021#T01200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1562081700,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The Minister of Sate, without interruption.

We may not fully agree on the approach to take but I acknowledge the Deputy's sincere commitment on the issue of medicinal cannabis and helping people from a compassionate point of view.  I also acknowledge Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's work on this issue.  Deputies Gino Kenny, Miche&aacute;l Martin and I worked for a lengthy period on this issue, which is beyond politics.  Other Deputies also worked on it.  I was pleased to be able to sign into law legislation underpinning the medical cannabis access programme on 26 June.  It is fair to say, as Deputy Kenny acknowledged, that this is a significant milestone and represents the outcome of more than two years of detailed work involving the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, an expert reference group of clinicians, since it was important to get clinical buy-in, the Health Service Executive and my Department.<\/p>  <p>  With this legislation in place, for the first time in Ireland potential producers and suppliers can apply to the HPRA to have cannabis products assessed for suitability for medical use in this programme.  The programme is intended for patients with certain conditions for whom conventional medicines have not worked.  This is not the first line of treatment but for people who have tried everything else for these conditions where conventional medicine is not working and their treating consultant believes this to be an appropriate course of action.  Once suitable products are available, it will be possible for a medical consultant to prescribe a listed cannabis-based treatment for a patient under his or her care for the following medical conditions where the patient has failed to respond to standard treatments, namely, spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and epilepsy.  Work on establishing this programme began in March 2017 and follows on from the roadmap laid out by the Health Products Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s expert report titled, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, published in March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA report did not recommend the inclusion of chronic pain in the access programme, but I reassure the Deputy, who has taken a close interest in the development of the programme, that this position will be kept under review and if better clinical evidence becomes available in the future, the inclusion of conditions such as chronic pain can be considered.  For patients with conditions such as chronic pain, the ministerial licence route is an option to access medicinal cannabis outside of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200022#U03100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1562082300,"counter":366,"content":"<p>This has been a long journey and the end of that journey last Wednesday, when we finally saw the law being changed and people being given access, was one of the proudest days in my time in the D&aacute;il.

It has been a brutal, protracted process.  An issue that has been raised over the last three years is the omission of chronic pain from the guidelines, especially from the HPRA's scientific report.

The success of this programme so far, torturous as it has been, is that there is significant clinical buy-in.  Clinicians themselves have quite rightly drawn up the guidelines for it.  Other conditions will be kept under review.  We have the clinical expert group in place and it can be reconvened from time to time.  I want to say to people who are not covered by the three conditions in the medical cannabis access programme that the ministerial licence scheme, under which a consultant may apply to the Minister of the day for access to a product that is not authorised, is still available.  I have never refused an application and I do not think any of my predecessors or successors would do so either.  If a consultant seeks access to a product, my Department generally recommends acceptance and the application is handled quickly.

I ask the Minister to comment on the independent review that was carried out, its recommendations and their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1562082900,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Heydon for this important question.  The report of the independent review group established to examine the role of voluntary organisations in publicly funded health and personal social services was published by me in February this year.  It makes 24 recommendations covering areas such as the governance of voluntary organisations; dialogue, engagement and contractual processes between the State and the voluntary sector; ethos, asset ownership and public capital investment; and broader issues related to health system development.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations are grounded in two key overarching findings.  First, the report recognises, as does the Deputy, the important contribution voluntary organisations make and concluded that they should continue to play an integral role in the delivery of health and social care services.  Second, it found a high level of mutual interdependence between the State and voluntary organisations and called for the development of a stronger relationship based on trust and partnership.<\/p>  <p>  I fully agree with and endorse the findings.  Voluntary organisations have an important role to play in the delivery of health services.  I have already signalled my commitment to further strengthen the relationship between the State and voluntary organisations but I also think I have an important role, as does the Government and the Oireachtas, in setting out policy.  It is a relationship that must mutually respect the responsibilities of each other.<\/p>  <p>  As a first step, I have given approval for the establishment of a new dialogue process between the Department, the HSE and other relevant health agencies and representatives of voluntary organisations in the health and social care sector, as was recommended in the report.  My Department is currently designing this process, including its terms of reference, membership and other practical considerations, and will be engaging with voluntary sector representative organisations in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this new dialogue process can provide a forum for engaging more effectively with voluntary organisations on key policies and initiatives.  I also believe it can provide a forum for taking forward other recommendations in the report such as those relating to governance, but perhaps more importantly, it can provide the platform for developing greater levels of trust and partnership across the system.  This must be a two-way process with recognition of the respective roles and mutual dependencies of both sides.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a broad range of other recommendations in the report that are under consideration.  The good news is that many of themes align with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and will be taken forward in that context.  Some require collaboration with other Departments such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that work is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1562082900,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we have remarkable voluntary organisations such as KARE in my constituency.  The Minister is aware of it, as it is also involved in west Wicklow as well as Kildare.  It was established in 1967 by parents and friends of children with intellectual disabilities who wanted their children to be able to live at home and to go to school locally.  KARE is a fantastic organisation that has since seen the development of two great schools in St. Anne's in the Curragh and St. Mark's in Newbridge.  I was a member of the board of management in St. Mark's for some time.  They provide a very good service.  I am aware of the challenges they face on an ongoing basis.  What the Minister said is very important about the future relationship between the Department, the HSE and voluntary organisations such as KARE.  The Department, the Minister and Members of the D&aacute;il are responsible for setting policy and we cannot abdicate that responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  I recently attended the KARE AGM and I was struck by what many of the service users said about their desire to live alone instead of in group houses in the community.  In order for them to be able to do that it requires multi-annual funding and long-term planning.

I am aware of the very good work of KARE in the Deputy's constituency and in mine, and the very good work of so many voluntary organisations across the country which are an integral part of the health service.  We could not do without them.  They were providing services long before the State bothered to do so.  My Department did not exist until the 1940s.  We had a State without a Department of Health because we were reliant on the voluntary sector and the church.  In addition, some of the largest hospitals in this country are also voluntary.  I respect the role of voluntary hospitals.  Many countries have them, but they must modernise, be more transparent and open and they must provide a seat at the table for public policymakers and representatives of the State.<\/p>  <p>  In the excellent report we are discussing, Ms Catherine Day made some good recommendations about having a public interest director or whatever we wish to call him or her.  We can and must respect the voluntary ethos, which I very much do, and the good work that is being done, but there is only one forum that sets public sector policy and health policy and no ethos should prevent people from accessing healthcare.  That is the type of discussion we need to start having with the sector in terms of how we can help by providing certainty of funding and multi-annual funding and how they can help us by making sure we can implement public policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V00800","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1562082900,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The Minister is dead right.  At the heart of the issue is addressing service level agreements and making sure they are fit for purpose.  In many ways, that will involve the agreements being reviewed and simplified so that they focus on service provision as much as possible.  I come across issues in my constituency all the time, which I have raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, regarding challenges for school leavers with intellectual disabilities when they reach the age of 18.  I am thankful that KARE is not among them, but we have voluntary organisations around the country that are constantly in deficit.  Recommendation 8.8 in the report is to assess if an organisation is adequately funded in the first place and if there are better ways to manage its budget.  If an organisation is in a constant cycle of deficits year-on-year, it will never get out of the cycle.  Such organisations are then hamstrung and cannot provide the service we need.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 8.3 relates to official recognition through a charter of the legally separate status of the voluntary sector reflecting its public service role.  Ultimately, it is about due recognition.  The report produced by the review group chaired by Ms Catherine Day is excellent.

I thank Ms Catherine Day, Ms Jane Grimson and Ms Deirdre Madden for doing that body of work.  In the report we heard from the voluntary sector that the organisations do not mind complying and providing information but they object to the level of bureaucracy and want us to make it simpler, in particular for smaller organisations, and not constantly ask them for the same information in multiple formats.  We must reduce the bureaucracy and form filling while making sure that we have the right level of oversight as well.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that we will have to address the funding issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I will have to look at the legacy issues with Government colleagues.  I am sure Deputy Heydon will agree that alongside any funding there must be reform.  I refer to such things as personalised budgets.  I do not believe the provision of disability and social care services is likely to be confined just to block grants, but will be more about personalised budgets and empowering the person with a disability as well.  Like any conversation with any interest group we will have to speak about appropriate levels of funding and certainty of funding but also how we reform and modernise the delivery of the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V01000","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","time":1562082900,"counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V01100"},{"type":"question","time":1562082900,"counter":381,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[27815\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for the provision of primary care centres in Portumna, Gort and Headford, County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1562082900,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister for Health the timeframe for the provision of primary care centres in Portumna, Gort and Headford in County Galway and if he will make a statement on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200023#V01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1562082900,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the development of the primary care centres in Portumna, Gort and Headford is being progressed.<\/p><p>Planning permission has been obtained for the Portumna development, and the HSE expects to enter into a lease agreement with the developer in quarter 3 of this year, which is quite shortly.<\/p> <p> Previous efforts to develop primary care centres in Gort and Headford have not been successful.

The big prize is getting the diagnostic facilities into the centres with the appropriate populations.  That obviously keeps people out of hospital.  I saw centres in Athlone and Castlebar recently that resulted in incredible redirection of people from the hospital setting to primary care.

Multi-disciplinary services including occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, continue to be provided to all children with disabilities regardless of condition, based on their specific needs.  The requirement for additional resources to provide appropriate and timely services for children and young people with complex needs has been identified by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and formal approval to proceed with the recruitment of 100 new therapy posts was issued last month.  <\/p>  <p>  All community healthcare organisations, CHOs, are now in the process of recruiting these posts.

The HSE is committed to the recruitment of these 100 therapy posts in its 2019 national service plan, with the Dublin north city and county CHO allocated 16 of these posts.

I will answer the questions in the context of the Labour Court tomorrow starting three days of intensive hearings and engagements on this dispute regarding some of the staff in our healthcare service represented by SIPTU.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that staff in the public service are already in receipt of a series of pay increases and pay restoration measures under the public service stability agreement, which will see public servants receiving an average 7% increase in their salaries over the lifetime of the agreement.  By the end of 2020, there is a commitment to restore 90% of the pay reductions experienced under the FEMPI legislation introduced after the economy was crashed by previous Governments.  Staff also benefit from a public sector pension, something that is highly valuable to the employees, as well as other benefits, such as flexible working, sick leave and maternity leave, that workers may not have in other areas of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of recruitment and retention of health service grades, the Public Service Pay Commission is continuing its work on assessing roles in the public service that have been identified as experiencing recruitment and retention issues.  The commission has already made recommendations in respect of nurses, consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and the Government has accepted these findings.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the industrial action that took place on 26 June by SIPTU support staff grades, I was pleased that talks between the parties resumed at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, last Thursday.  It is fair to say that some progress was made, but it was not possible to reach agreement on all issues.  As a result, the matter has been referred to the Labour Court for an early hearing, which will commence tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that SIPTU acted in good faith by deferring two days of its planned industrial action, for which I thank it, we cannot forget that one day of action went ahead involving 10,000 staff across 38 healthcare facilities.  In advance of the action, contingency plans were put in place to provide emergency cover.  I thank those involved in that.  Given the broad range of roles involved in the dispute and the fact that work practices can vary between sites, the majority of contingency planning had to be negotiated locally, which made the situation even more complex.  Maintaining essential daily care for our patients in areas such as nutrition, hydration, patient transfers, cleaning and infection control posed an immense challenge.  Despite the best efforts made around the contingency plans and trying to provide as complete a service as possible, however, it was the patients and their families who were disrupted most as a result of the industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Deputies that, prior to the dispute, constructive and positive engagement by the parties involved took place at the WRC.  I am disappointed that the issue did not go to the Labour Court before the industrial action went ahead, but it will be before the court tomorrow and I hope for a resolution.

I made reference at the joint committee and in the Chamber to the numbers of Irish greyhounds on studbooks and breeding establishment books in China.  I mentioned the fact that rescue groups which take our greyhounds back from these countries do not want them to come back to Ireland such is the possibility of abuse here.

I want to hear from the Minister of State that will change things.  I hope this is the last nail in the coffin for the greyhound industry.  We must see an end to the cruelty to these dogs, the way they are being treated and exported as well as the way hares are treated in the industry.  We must have a serious look at investigating these organisations on the basis of the RT&Eacute; programme.  I want to hear the Minister of State state that now and, if necessary, to withdraw the funding given to these organisations pending change.  We should stop greyhound racing.  It is gone.

I wish to again reassure the House that the Department takes any allegations of breaches of animal welfare rules very seriously and will thoroughly investigate and take the necessary enforcement actions to deal with such offences.<\/p>  <p>  The new Greyhound Racing Act 2019 passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas, with the assistance and input of Deputies, recently and was signed into law last month.  I am confident the new Act will: improve the governance of Bord na gCon; strengthen regulatory controls in the industry; modernise sanctions; and improve integrity within the sector.  Under the Act, Bord na gCon may make regulations to require the registration of greyhound owners, the registration of racing greyhounds and the notification by owners, breeders and trainers of greyhounds of many more life events compared with those currently captured on existing studbook and microchipping databases.<\/p><p>These regulations will support the board in its ambition to establish and maintain a new comprehensive tracing database for racing greyhounds and will provide greater powers to deal with areas such as anti-doping, integrity and sanctions, the need for which has only been further underlined by what we saw recently.  It is deeply frustrating that the breaches of animal welfare that were highlighted by RT&Eacute; have come to light in the year that saw the largest ever allocation of funding, of &euro;2,751,000, to animal welfare organisations.  A total of 108 organisations are benefitting under these arrangements and I appreciate the valuable work these organisations do to protect the welfare of animals on a daily basis.  An animal welfare lo-call helpline is in place, along with a dedicated email address, which facilitates the reporting by members of the public of any suspicion that animal cruelty is taking place.  All calls received are treated in confidence and are followed up by authorised officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I urge anyone who has witnessed a breach of animal welfare rules to use this facility.<\/p> <p> I take this opportunity to highlight some of what has been achieved for animal welfare by this Government.  The Government has demonstrated a strong and consistent record regarding the enforcement of animal welfare rules, including the review of 100 years of animal welfare legislation, leading to the enactment of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  Since then, a total of 73 successful prosecutions have been taken under the Act, with a further 30 prosecutions for welfare abuses currently being processed.  The use of wild animals in circuses was banned in 2017 and this week, the Government has taken the decision in principle to ban fur farming over a phased period.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, will bring forward the general scheme of a Bill to the Government to provide for this ban without delay.<\/p> <p> I stress that the Department does not issue certificates for the export of greyhounds to China or Pakistan and no certificates have been issued for the export of greyhounds from Ireland to either of those destinations since I was appointed as Minister of State.  I can also confirm that the Department is engaging in a review of the licensing conditions in knackeries, with regard to the practices seen on RT&Eacute;'s \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme.  All allegations will be examined to determine the appropriate actions needed.  I also understand that coursing activity on Whiddy Island will be investigated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and will be pursued by the relevant authorities.  I fully understand and empathise with the views and concerns of members of the public and their response to the contents of this programme, which undermined our deeply felt national attachment to the care and welfare of all animals.  In recent days, Bord na gCon, the IGB, has published the first steps of its action plan to strengthen traceability, re-homing and welfare standards by improved regulation, more inspections and the use of greater resources in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200028#AA00900","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562086500,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200029#BB00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1562086500,"counter":452,"content":"<p>One minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200029#BB00300","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1562086500,"counter":453,"content":"<p>In all fairness-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200029#BB00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1562086500,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I will be visiting the headquarters of Bord Na gCon shortly to meet with its chair and board members to discuss welfare standards in the industry.

It was said that it was better to have coursing licensed, but we all knew there was unlicensed stuff going on and the programme also noted that a number of people from the licensed coursing clubs were attending those meetings.  There was a big hoo-ha about the Government funding granted to the FAI and Repak, but why is the same standard not being applied to the IGB and the amount of funding it is getting?  The funding should be withheld until these particular issues are addressed.  We are not dealing with it because they are animals.

We are talking about 6,000 greyhounds being brought to knackeries each year, and being beaten to death because they cannot run fast enough.  This is not livestock: these are animals that should be treated with respect.  I am asking the Minister of State to tell the Irish greyhound industry immediately that its funding will be stopped if these issues are not dealt with.  We should only issue passports to greyhounds going to countries with welfare conditions of a standard as high as our own and that should be double checked.

They will not survive what is coming down the road.  The Minister and the Taoiseach must ask the European Union to put a stay on this deal at least until we see the outcome of Brexit.

Since my election in 2016, the House has discussed the economic crisis facing the beef industry numerous times.  The Taoiseach recently told people the Government would always have their back.  That statement rings extremely hollow in light of the agreement with Mercosur, which will be the final nail in the coffin of the beef industry.  The point raised most consistently with me by farmers over the weekend was the challenge they will face as a result of climate change.  The Commission is talking out of the other side of its mouth on this issue by allowing beef to be transported halfway across the world to displace European beef from European shelves.  Brexit will pose a major economic challenge for us.  We will be 116% self-sufficient in beef when Brexit takes place, yet the Commission is selling out our beef industry.

The agreement reached on 28 June on an EU-Mercosur trade deal marks the end of 20 years of negotiations between the two blocs.  While I acknowledge the importance of balanced international trade deals for Ireland's economy, including its agricultural sector, I am very disappointed that the agreement includes a significant tariff rate quota that would allow the importation of beef from Mercosur to the European Union at preferential tariff rates at a time when the beef sector in Europe is facing significant uncertainty because of Brexit.  I have worked hard with other Ministers and the Taoiseach, and with colleagues in other European member states, to mitigate the potential impact of an EU-Mercosur agreement on European agriculture.  While the outcome is disappointing, the length of time it has taken to arrive at this point is at least in part due to the concerted efforts over many years of Ireland and other like-minded member states to protect the European Union agricultural sector to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to pointing out the considerable difficulties that the concessions of a significant beef tariff rate quota would create for the Irish beef sector over a period when the European beef market is likely to continue to be very delicately balanced and against the backdrop of a potentially very damaging impact from Brexit, Ireland repeatedly called for coherence between the European Union's trade policy objectives and its climate change responsibilities to be demonstrated by not extending more favourable conditions to beef imports from trade partners that are producing in a less environmentally sustainable manner.  We have focused not only on the EU's market impact and sustainability aspects but also on the size of the quota, the technicalities associated with quota management and the cumulative impact of potential concessions under the range of current and future negotiations in order to mitigate the outcome of these negotiations.  It is worth noting in this regard that the beef tariff rate quota agreed is considerably less than that which had been sought by Mercosur countries which, at one point, were demanding a quota of 300,000 tonnes.  In addition, the tariff rate quota is split between fresh and frozen product and will be phased in over a period of years.  Therefore, the full impact of the agreement is unlikely to be felt for a considerable period.<\/p>  <p>  We must also acknowledge that there may be some opportunities for the Irish dairy sector and drinks industry.  In addition, our colleagues at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation estimate that a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  It is early days and there are still a number of steps to be taken before the agreement can be implemented.  It will be first put through a process called legal scrubbing and translation which could take up to two years.  It will then be submitted to the Council of trade Ministers for approval by qualified majority vote and to the European Parliament for its consent.  If provisionally applied at that point, it would still take a number of years to come into full effect.  The Oireachtas and other national parliaments may also ultimately have a role in ratification.   We will examine the text carefully to assess its impact on the Irish economy and the agrifood sector generally and reflect on the appropriate steps in the context of both engaging further with member state colleagues and examining ways to diminish the potential impact of the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200030#CC00600","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1562087100,"counter":470,"content":"<p>As with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, during Leaders' Questions this morning, I do not detect any significant push-back from the Minister in respect of this deal.

Oireachtas Members and local councillors for that electoral area were told that at a briefing by the ETB that afternoon and later that day the ETB put the proposal to the full ETB board, which approved the proposal, unfortunately.  Subsequently, the representatives of teachers and the boards of management were informed of the ETB proposal.  This came completely out of the blue.<\/p>  <p>  It is an area that I know well because I am from Bawnboy.  There was no indication of any such proposal being considered by the education and training board.  Packed public meetings were held in Bawnboy and Belturbet, where the organisers of the meetings asked for the communities' views on the ETB proposal.  There was a very clear message from both meetings that the local community in each school area absolutely opposed the closure of the schools and proposed so-called amalgamation.<\/p>  <p>  The meetings were representative of the school community in both cases.  Speakers on the night included students, past pupils, former teachers, representatives of local sporting and voluntary organisations, and local business.  Testimonies were given that night by past pupils who had gone to forge very successful careers in many different disciplines of the important influence the schools had on their development as persons and in their chosen careers.  Those testimonies were from people working in our own country and people working abroad as well.<\/p>  <p>  I have received correspondence from numerous past pupils of both schools who outlined clearly their appreciation of the schools' role in their education and in preparing them for careers.  It was clear that these schools have had great accomplishments over the years with their students.<\/p>  <p>  Both Bawnboy and Belturbet are located in north-west Cavan, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, would know.  Students travel over considerable distances to attend both schools.  One has to look at the geography when one considers amalgamation or providing services in a different location than where they have been provided up to now.  If a school was provided in Ballyconnell, the students furthest west of Bawnboy would be lost to a school in an adjoining catchment area, in a neighbouring county and in a different province.  Similarly, the students in the Belturbet catchment area adjoining the Cavan town catchment area would be most likely to travel to Cavan town to source their second level education rather than Ballyconnell, also for distance reasons.  Cavan town post-primary is already heavily subscribed with all second level schools there with full enrolments.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed submissions have been made to the Department and the Minister, Deputy McHugh, in respect of the role of the schools and their accomplishments over the years.  Those submissions detailed the many national award winners and scholarship winners from both schools and the participation by both of those schools in all-Ireland competitions, in European competitions and, indeed, in other international competitions where they brought great honour and glory to our country.<\/p>  <p>  I am anxious that the detailed submissions are given very serious consideration by the Department of Education and Skills.

Both schools are post-primary co-educational schools operating under the auspice of CMETB.  St. Bricin's College in Belturbet has an enrolment of 195 students in the current academic year.  This is a slight decrease from 222 pupils in 2014.  St. Mogue's College enrolment is 227, which is an increase from 197 in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McHugh, wishes to advise the Deputy that the initiative for any amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management and patrons.  Any such proposal to amalgamate schools must involve consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level.  If I can just comment on that, stakeholders have to buy into an amalgamation for it to be a successful one.  In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers and local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system.  If I may add, students' views must also be taken into account.  Any proposals are then subject to the approval of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McHugh, can confirm that the Department received a proposal from CMETB to amalgamate St. Bricin's College in Belturbet and St. Mogue's College in Bawnboy in December last following the unanimous approval of the proposal by the board of CMETB on 26 November 2018.  The ETB proposes locating a new school entity in Ballyconnell.

There is no buy-in from any stakeholder regarding this proposal.  Meetings and consultations are being held now that should have taken place before November 2018.  In replies to a number of my parliamentary questions, the Department has stressed that there has to be detailed consultation by the patron of the school with all stakeholders before any proposal would go to the Department.  That is the way it should be but, unfortunately, it is not how this has come about.  I know the area very well because I am a native.  There is absolute opposition to the proposal.  The staff in the schools, parents of students attending both colleges, past pupils and the wider school community are all in favour of retaining the two schools.  I have outlined the geographical considerations as well.  Some pupils who attend those schools at present would, if they closed, go to schools in adjoining catchment areas, some of them in different counties and provinces.  That is not the way to deliver second-level education in north-west Cavan.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to go back to the Minister as she stated she would.  For a relatively small capital investment at each school, a range of additional facilities could be provided.  I have attended awards nights in the schools and have listened to people like the directors of schools at the ETB or, prior to that, the VEC, as well as guest speakers.  They laud and praise the schools for the quality of the teaching and leadership, for their achievements from an educational and extracurricular point of view, for their participation in sports in so many disciplines and for their active role in many cross-Border projects.

In areas of mature population where enrolment numbers are reducing over time and school buildings are not being utilised to full capacity, or where there is a separate single-sex school, amalgamation can also be merited.  Equally, it has to be recognised that there can be significant sensitivities involved.  These are best addressed through a process of local dialogue and consultation aimed at ensuring that any proposal meets the interests of the communities concerned.  The ETB has considered that a new school catering for the enrolment of 500 students would better serve the educational needs of the area and provide improved facilities for both schools.  A new school would also strengthen the continuance of a post-primary school provision in the west Cavan area.<\/p>  <p>  Those are the notes that I have from the Minister's office.

In 2019 some 53,000 people will receive 17.9 million home support hours.  This includes supporting 550 patients to leave hospital over the winter period.  A further 235 people will receive 360,000 hours through intensive home care packages.  More than 10,900 people will be supported to leave hospital through transitional care funding.  We take this important issue very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of transitional care beds assists with patients in acute hospitals who are ready for discharge, but who need nursing home care or a period of convalescence up to a maximum of four weeks.  The scheme funds these patients in private nursing home beds, thereby facilitating the discharge of the patients from the acute setting and allowing their beds to be used for other patients.  The system of transitional care provision has been in place since 2015 and is available to all public hospitals in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Under the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2019, a budget of &euro;28.5 million has been allocated to support discharges from acute hospitals to transitional or step-down care.  Despite this significant level of funding and service provision, the demand for services continues to grow.  The allocation of funding across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.<\/p>  <p>  Up to May 2019, approvals were being allocated on a demand-led basis, as requests for this type of care normally tend to decrease over the summer months.  This, however, has not been the case in 2019 and the number of requests for transitional care has continued to increase.  The highest expenditure for the year occurred in the months of April and May 2019.  The waiting time for transitional care at present is approximately one week.  As of today, there are 23 people on the waiting list for transitional care funding who have applied for the fair deal scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Transitional care funding is a national support service and there is no specific allocation for any region such as the Cork\/Kerry Community Health Organisation.  It is administered taking account of the available resource envelope, with funding distributed accordingly across the regions over the entire year.  By the end of May, funding approval was provided for 378 transitional care beds in CHO 4.  Preliminary data from June indicates that about a further 60 approvals were provided for CHO 4 in that month.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is required to deliver services within its available budget.  To ensure there is sufficient funding available for the remainder of the year and to ensure that expenditure is in line with the transitional care funding allocation at the end of the year the HSE is managing its allocation of funding approvals having regard to the significant volume of approvals released in the first five months of the year.

There were 834 people on trolleys in CUH in June.  It is absolutely incredible.  A big factor is that nearly 54% of the bed capacity is taken up by 10% of patients.  This is through no fault of their own.  It is due to a lack of a place for the patient to go to.  This scheme would allow those patients to get into nursing homes.

This scheme allows people, where they are fit and healthy, to leave hospital to go into another bed.  The scheme should be funded adequately to ensure that every available nursing home bed, through whatever scheme, is taken up and that every potential space in the hospital system is created.

A person who has a delayed transfer of care is a person who has been deemed clinically fit for discharge from the acute bed, but whose discharge is delayed because he or she is waiting for some form of ongoing support or care following the discharge.  There has been a substantial focus in recent years on reducing the delayed transfer of care, commonly known as delayed discharges, and enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner.  This year the HSE aims to support some 10,900 people to leave hospital through the transitional care funding.  Between 1 January and 31 May there were 4,861 approvals nationally, equating to approximately 231 per week, which is 20 per week ahead of target.<\/p>  <p>  Given the increase in approvals over the first part of the year, approval rates must now reduce during the summer months to ensure the service stays within its budget.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Buckley spoke of the needs of patients, which absolutely must be addressed in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Deputy Ferris pointed to the figure of &euro;28.5 million in funding.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to deaths and overcrowding, which is not acceptable.  We also have to deal with the bed capacity issue.  The plan is to invest in more capacity in our health service.<\/p>  <p>  The Independent Expert Review of Delayed Discharges report was published in November.  The review recognised the points raised and that delayed discharges are caused by a multitude of factors.  The review made nine recommendations that include the development of a national policy to provide for a more consistent approach to recording delayed discharges, strengthening data collection, standardising the definitions and ensuring consistent discharge guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Following publication of the report immediate focus was on reducing delayed discharges as we entered the winter season through mobilising additional resources that were made available and in ensuring that social care measures were effected without delay.<\/p><p>I will bring the points raised to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.

The Bill should make the commercial rates regime more efficient and effective for ratepayers and local authorities.  Commercial rates are a vital source of local authority income, making up approximately one third of local government current income every year, making them the single largest source of income for local authorities and providing income to the sector of almost &euro;1.5 billion per annum.  This income provides between 16% and 53% of total funding for local services at individual local authority level and makes a vital contribution to the delivery of local services that businesses and communities benefit from.<\/p><p>The core objective of the Bill concerns improvements in commercial rates and further proposed amendments will include making additions to the valuation list immediately effective for rating.  Furthermore, there are proposed critical and time-sensitive amendments to other legislation.  For reasons of efficiency and urgency, it is proposed to include a number of additional amendments in the Bill.  These were signalled on Committee Stage and members of the select committee were briefed by my officials.<\/p><p>As the House is aware, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019, enacted on 24 May, introduces a number of key measures and reforms designed to enhance enforcement powers for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants and underpin further the operation of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, arrangements, along with further targeted priority measures.  While the majority of the provisions in the Act have already been commenced, it is the Minister's intention to commence the provisions relating to student accommodation in July, ahead of the upcoming academic year.  The remaining provisions, relating to annual registration, are scheduled for commencement in the first quarter of 2020, when the RTB is in a position to roll out annual registration.<\/p><p>The Minister has worked closely with the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, the Attorney General and members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to deliver these important protections for students, living in student-specific accommodation.  It is important that the 4% per annum rent increase restriction in RPZs applies in this sector and that there is recourse for students to the dispute resolution services of the RTB.  Students in both private and public residential accommodation are deserving of equal protection.  Tenancy and licence registration requirements and the new RTB sanctioning regime for improper conduct will also apply to the student-specific accommodation.<\/p><p>The changes relating to the recently enacted student-specific accommodation provisions, including section 37, of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are primarily technical.  The amendment to section 37 also has the effect of closing off a potential means of circumventing the application of aspects of the Act of 2004 to student-specific accommodation occupied under licence.  Technical amendments are also proposed to clarify that the student-specific accommodation provisions and the provisions requiring annual registration can come into force separately and to replace &quot;include&quot; with &quot;apply to&quot; in the new section 3(1A)(a) that was inserted into the Act of 2004 by section 3 of the Act of 2019.  The student-specific accommodation provisions are intended to commence in mid-July, prior to the later commencement of the provisions requiring annual registration that are expected to commence in quarter 1 of 2020, hence the urgency to address this issue before the summer recess.<\/p><p>The Act of 2019 also amended section 19 of the Act of 2004 to specify the types of works, including energy rating improvement works, that could qualify for the exemption from the RPZ rent increase restrictions that apply where a substantial change in the nature of the rental accommodation has been achieved that warrants a greater rent level.  As protected structures are unable to qualify for this exemption on the basis of works to improve their building energy rating, it is proposed to further amend section 19(5)(a) of the Act of 2004 to allow the first rent set under the tenancy of a protected structure dwelling not rented in the previous 12 months to be the market rent.<\/p><p>I move now to the planning amendments referred to in the motion.  An amendment is required to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for transitional arrangements that are required, following the recent establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This is a time-critical amendment in the context of the preparation of regional spatial and economic strategies, RSES, by the three regional assemblies, which are at an advanced stage.  As currently enacted, the legislation provides only that the Minister can issue a direction in regard to the strategies on foot of a recommendation made to him by the planning regulator on the basis of the regulator having already been involved in the RSES process from the outset and having made submissions on the draft RSES document.  However, the requirement relating to the planning regulator being involved from the outset cannot be satisfied for the current strategies as the process for all three had formally commenced prior to the establishment of the office.  In all three cases, a draft regional strategy was published prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator and submissions have already been made by the Minister.<\/p><p>The amendment now proposed provides for transitional arrangements to ensure that the Minister has a robust legal basis to issue a direction to a regional assembly, if necessary, that is not dependent on a recommendation by the planning regulator.  The amendment will allow the Minister to issue a ministerial direction to the regional assemblies, if required, to ensure that the RSES is consistent with the national planning framework or other key Government strategies and national policies.  This amendment has the effect of reverting back to the position that pertained prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  However, in the spirit of the Act, and in recognition that the new office has since been established, the proposed transitional arrangements include provision for the regulator to be requested by the Minister to enter into the RSES process in an advisory capacity.  To facilitate this advisory engagement in the context of the current RSES process, the four-week timeframe for the Minister to issue a draft direction, which was the norm prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator, is being extended to six weeks.<\/p><p>A further minor technical amendment is also being proposed to section 11(1)(b) of the Act to underpin the special provisions for Cork city and county councils to extend the period for review of their development plans, in order to incorporate the regional spatial and economic strategy into their plan.  This ensures consistency in section 11(1)(a) and 11(1)(b) provisions.<\/p><p>In light of the urgent nature of the proposed amendments I have described, I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200034#GG00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1562089500,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Cassells, who is sharing time with Deputy Casey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200034#GG00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1562089500,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this rates Bill as we see it come to its final stages.  I appreciate that, following on from committee last week, there are a number of additional areas that the Minister of State has outlined he wishes to see included.<\/p>  <p>  When I speak on this matter, I always stress the fact that this is a huge part of our local government system.  Our councils would not function without the moneys that are raised from local businesses in each county, and this always needs to be said.  Some &euro;1.5 billion was raised in revenues last year and, over the course of this decade, we have seen the cumulative total raised by some 14%, which should never be forgotten.  I am always conscious of the role businesses play through their payment of rates in ensuring we have councils that can offer services.  As the Minister of State said, anything that helps the system work more efficiently is to be welcomed and, therefore, many of the proposals being brought forward are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>I am disappointed that amendments brought forward last week on Committee Stage by Fianna F&aacute;il were not accepted, in particular our proposals regarding the phasing of multi-annual payments in the case of a business that has been hit by a rates revaluation which leads to a significant increase in the rates payable by it.  We believe businesses hit with a substantial increase should be afforded the opportunity of phased payments.  I am even more disappointed that our proposals around an inability to pay clause were not accepted.  Outside of the booming city of Dublin and other cities, there are towns that are struggling.  There are main streets in which a huge proportion of properties are vacant.  This issue has to be grappled with.  Without money coming through the door, businesses do not have money to pay rates bills to the county council or to the rates officers looking for their pound of flesh.  The insertion of an inability to pay clause would have been a positive move.  I am disappointed that the Government, supported by Sinn F&eacute;in in this new right wing coalition of friends, voted it down.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward an amendment in regard to the public consultation process and rates abatement to allow for a more transparent process, which, I hope, will be accepted.  I understand the time sensitive nature in terms of many of the issues outlined by the Minister of State.  Fianna F&aacute;il will work with the Government over the next couple of days to ensure the passage of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200034#GG00500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562090100,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, for his statement and his engagement over the last number of years in regard to this Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Cassells, outlined the critical role that commercial rates play in our local authorities.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the majority of the provisions in this Bill, which seeks to modernise the commercial rates system and give our local representatives the power to introduce incentive schemes where they believe they are need, which is good for the democratic process.  Equally, I welcome the amendment we discussed last week in committee in regard to the global and national revaluations.  Local authorities such as Wicklow County Council will not be affected because it is having a national revaluation in the same year as a global revaluation but the council will not miss out.  One of the controversial issues that arose last week was the revaluations by Irish Water which will commence this year, the impact that process will have on local authorities and how receipts will be divvied out to ensure that local authorities which have been rating their water infrastructure will not lose revenue because of the Irish Water valuation.<\/p>  <p>  On the planning provisions of the Bill and the proposed amendment, my understanding is that this is required because the planning regulator office's was not established in time in regard to the process of the regional assemblies being brought forward and that it seeks to give the planning regulator an additional two weeks to review the draft plans with a view to confirming to the Minister that they are consistent with all national and regional policies but the Minister retains the power to take action, if required, to have the regional assemblies review them.  Perhaps the Minister of State would confirm if my understanding of the amendment is correct.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cassells mentioned the issue of inability to pay and the need for harmonisation of commercial rates in the case of properties that have not been revalued for 20 or 30 years and are hit with a revaluation.  This is not the fault of the property owners.  Rather, it is the fault of the system yet the property owner is asked to meet the cost of the revaluation, which in some cases can be a 200%, 300% or 400% in one year.  Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal, which was not supported, sought to harmonise payments over a number of years to remove the initial hard hit.  Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal on public consultation in regard to alleviation or abatement schemes is important.  As a commercial ratepayer I know that a lot of commercial ratepayers do not understand the system.  Anything we can do to bring transparency to the system and a greater understanding of how it works has to be welcomed.  I am delighted the Minister has agreed with our amendment.  I thank the staff for their work on the wording of the amendment.  <\/p>  <p>  The elephant in the room, which we all have to address at some stage, is the antiquated valuation process.  I understand the Minister of State proposes to do work on it in the autumn.  We need to bring an understanding to the valuation process because businesses cannot get their heads around it.  Trying to explain that under zones A, B and C, the first 1 m in the door is rateable at a particular rate and the next 5 m is rateable at another rate and so on and how the value is calculated is complicated.  This is the aspect that we still need to address going forward.<\/p>  <p>  In general, Fianna F&aacute;il is happy with the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 and we are willing to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200035#HH00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562090100,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The motion before us a technical one that seeks to give the Minister permission to introduce amendments to the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 that have nothing to do with that Bill but are related to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and the national spatial strategies.  I do not propose to speak to the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 or the substance of the amendments being proposed because I can do that on Report Stage later in the week but I do want to comment on this practice.  This is the third time detailed technical amendments have been introduced to legislation on Report Stage by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This is not a good practice.  I support some of the amendments and I do not support others but the Minister of State and I can tease out them on Report Stage tomorrow or Thursday.<\/p>  <p>  There is a reason we have Committee Stage followed by Report Stage.  It gives Members, including the Opposition, time to tease out with the Minister and the officials not only the intent of the legislation but the implications of it.  Where a provision is allowed to pass on Committee Stage, we can discuss and reflect on it with colleagues or third parties before making a final decision on Report Stage.  None of us objects to amendments being introduced on Report Stage to legislation in respect of which there is an urgency.  The fact this is the third time this has happened in the case of a Department that has not had to draft that much legislation in the past two years shows it is becoming a trend.  I know this is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, or the officials who are here diligently paying attention to this discussion, because they are dealing with the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 but this is a real concern.  For example, one of the amendments the Minister of State is seeking permission to introduce by way of this motion is an amendment to try to close a loophole to the definition of student-specific accommodation in legislation we recently dealt with.  This suggests to me that officials in the Department when drafting that legislation were probably put under a significant amount of pressure from the Minister to meet the deadline for that Bill, which was substantially later in its passage through the Oireachtas than the Minister originally proposed despite the fact that it was facilitated it in a collegiate way by the Oireachtas committee.  That makes me nervous because if there was a mistake, error or something not noticed under pressure in that legislation what is to say the same has not happened with some of the legislation by way of the amendment that we are dealing with today.  This is not in any way a criticism of any official.  I do not envy the job of the officials having to a lot of this work under extreme time pressure.  The fact we will not have had the opportunity to properly consider the text of the amendments on Committee Stage is bad practice.  I acknowledge the officials who attended the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to brief it on the intent of the amendments.  While it was very welcome, it is not good practice.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to bring back my views to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan, which, I think, are widely held views on the housing committee.  I say that as somebody who supports most of the amendments the Minister of State is bringing forward.<\/p>  <p>  On the technical motion before us, Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose it.  We will also facilitate the amendments but on behalf of the housing committee, I ask that it not become standard practice where with all legislation in the future, we deal with other technical details.  For example, the amendment in regard to the spatial strategies was a big issue for us.<\/p><p>The officials provided a clear explanation but it is a very technical amendment.  It is eight pages long.  That is as long as some entire Bills.  I do not question the intent behind it but I have less time as an Oireachtas Member to go through the technical detail and be confident in my view before I vote in favour or against it than I otherwise would.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to make this standard practice.  Of course we will facilitate him today as we have done before but let us not be here in a few months, if this Government is still in place, dealing with the same problems.  Strictly speaking, Report Stage is for amendments to the Bill that are consequential to what we have already discussed.  There is a rule that we have to raise those issues on Committee Stage so that it is all flagged in advance.  I am increasingly uncomfortable with the way in which additional amendments, some of which are as long as entire Bills, come before us on Report Stage.  It is not great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200035#HH00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562090700,"counter":504,"content":"<p>We will not obstruct this motion either because these are things that need to be done.  I share Deputy &Oacute; Broin's concern about the process.  We did not deal with the issues at the appropriate time.  I am especially concerned about student accommodation, a relatively recent issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas, which we all campaigned for and welcome.  Dealing with it in this way is not ideal in the context of how we do business.  I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government so I have not been involved as much in the detail as others, although I recognise that I have the right to attend, but I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which takes up a great deal of my time.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the process.  The elements of it that the Minister of State outlined are understandable, relating to the Office of the Planning Regulator, for which the timing is important, the issue of Cork City Council and Cork County Council, which is self-explanatory, and student-specific issues.  We want to ensure that the parts relating to student-specific matters work well because we have all seen protests outside Leinster House about the provision of student accommodation, where rents were substantially increased.  We want to see them included in the rent pressure zones.  While I am talking about rent pressure zones, I welcome the extension to include the rest of Limerick city, something for which I had been campaigning for a long time.  There are many other things that I could say about what we need to do in the context of rent protection but I welcome the fact that Limerick city north and Limerick city west will join Limerick city east on the list of rent pressure zones.  There are other areas just outside some of the zones, including some of the counties represented here, that will come under pressure.  That is not relevant to what I am supposed to be speaking about so I will go back to the motion.<\/p>  <p>  What the Minister of State said about protected structures concerns me somewhat.  I know that this about the content of amendments rather than what we are doing right now.  I understand that the owners of protected structures cannot avail of some of the measures relating to energy ratings, etc., but I am concerned that the first rent set for a tenancy in the previous 12 months is deemed to be the market rent.  The Minister of State will presumably explain the position during the debate on the Bill but I am concerned that this is an open-ended way to set rent.  Other than that, I think the issue of regional assemblies, etc., is understandable.  I will not try to stop this from happening but we certainly need appropriate debate on all of these issues, especially where long amendments are being proposed at this stage in the legislative process.  We will have an opportunity to address the matter but it would have been better if we had more scrutiny and if we did not deal with complex Bills by adding provisions that do not deal with the relevant issue, which is the case with some of the proposed amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1562090700,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I echo some of the comments made by previous speakers regarding the method being to facilitate these amendments.  That method makes matters difficult when scrutinising amendments and having a proper debate on them.  It also affects the primary legislation and has an impact on getting it passed in a timely fashion and ensuring that it is workable.  Some of the amendments relating to the Residential Tenancies Act and student accommodation are worthwhile but they are very detailed and complex and should be dealt with specifically in that context of that legislation.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 is the measure that this amendment will change.  It is worrying that these Acts have been passed while these things are still missing and that the way to get it back in again is to add it to this Bill rather than having it as a stand-alone measure so that it could be the subject of proper scrutiny and discussion.  The latter would have been far more preferable.  It would probably cause a certain amount of embarrassment for the Government to have to amend an Act that has just been passed.  Perhaps that is why this is being done.  It appears that we are discussing the Local Government (Rates) Bill but we are not; we are discussing the other two Acts that the Government is amending.  That probably covers it as far as the Minister of State is concerned.  These should subjected to the scrutiny and discussion that they deserve.

I have been working for some time to have Tipperary County Council urgently reconsider its operational approach to the delivery of the N24 Davitt Street road improvement contract in Tipperary town and in respect of many other towns in which work has to take place on badly needed infrastructure.  Some consideration must be given in drawing up the contract to temporary bypasses that could be introduced.  We should stand behind the counters of the businesses and understand, from the point of view of their owners, how hard it is to keep the doirse ar oscailt - the doors open.  Little or no consideration is given to that, however.  Given the scale of the adverse impact on the financial viability of local commercial premises in Tipperary town, I also requested that the local authority apply an immediate reduction in respect of chargeable commercial rates.  This would be a temporary, once-off measure.  It is a matter of deep regret to me that the council has confirmed that it intends to refuse this request.  It is a real punch in the teeth for hard-pressed ratepayers.  I am talking about ratepayers who want to pay and who have a good record of paying, not the fly-by-nights that do not want to pay for anything.  I salute the business people.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its reply, the council noted that it is disappointed to hear that the businesses are being affected so badly.  It stated that the contractors involved are making every effort to reduce the impact on businesses as they carry out works throughout the town.  I am sure that, like me, the Minister of State will find the council's use of the word \"disappointed\" very revealing.  Disappointment is no good.  The council is in charge and should have consulted, engaged and tried to work with the ratepayers.<\/p><p>After all, they are their customers.  A business person who treated a customer like that would be out of business.  The connectivity is very poor.  The council betrays an extraordinary level of detachment from the commercial reality in the town since the commencement of works several months ago.  If the work extends down the entire street, it will go on for two years.<\/p> <p> On a related matter, at the start of this year I called on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to clarify the reason his Department has failed to conduct a review of the economic impact of local authority rates on small and medium sized businesses.  That was after the Minister confirmed the absence of the review to me despite acknowledging that the annual rate of valuation, ARV, increased each year from 2016 to 2018.  We now know that from 2015 to 2017 local authorities collected more than &euro;4 billion in rates nationally, with &euro;1.34 billion of that coming in during 2017 alone.  That is an enormous amount.  The latest available figures for County Tipperary, from 2016, showed that while &euro;34.1 million in commercial rates was due to be collected, only &euro;26.4 million was actually collected, leaving arrears of &euro;7.07 million.  We know the reason for that was that business is so dismal in the county.  It clearly demonstrates that businesses are struggling to pay existing levels of commercial rates, never mind having to deal with year-on-year increases such as those confirmed by the Minister today.<\/p> <p> It is vital that businesses and SMEs are supported, especially in light of the challenges that Brexit will inevitably have on them.  For this reason, I welcome many of the measures in the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to clarify the issue of rates calculation for service stations.  That is a major issue.  The Minister of State is nodding and looking at his officials.  I hope he will clarify the position.  I am aware of a wonderful young businessman, Mr. Alan O'Donnell, his father Noel and his family, who have a service station in Cahir.  He undertook a significant expansion and gives much employment and service to the public.  On the basis that he is selling petrol on the forecourt, his rates this year jumped fourfold from &euro;5,000 to &euro;21,000.  Such an increase could not be factored into the borrowings and investment on such a major project.  Many other long-standing motor factors and service station businesses in Cahir are similarly affected.  They cannot sustain the increases.  There are high costs attached to the sale of petrol and diesel and the turnover is low.  Something must be done to help such businesses.  Was an impact analysis carried out as to how the decision on forecourts and service stations was reached?  We cannot have such issues arising.  I seek a reply in that regard from the Minister of State.<\/p> <p> What does the Bill propose?  Among the measures included are provisions to allow local authorities to restate a charge or rate to be levied on each relevant property for which the current occupier or owner of the property will be liable.  That is very important because people change.  We want to rejuvenate towns.  If the rates continue to be punitively high, we will not get rejuvenation and we will not get living towns back again.  The uptake of the living city initiative is very slow because it has not been marketed.  I am aware that people applied for certain schemes but the response from Tipperary County Council was totally lethargic and inept.  The council was slow in giving approval for schemes and it found every reason in the world to deny access to schemes.  Long delays were experienced when worthwhile projects were put forward for disused premises, some pubs and shops.  The scheme should be simplified.  If premises are closed for a certain period, applicants should be able to get a break.  That would do two things.  It would boost the living environment of the town and bring footfall back and it would also deal with the housing crisis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is a junior Minister in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We must encourage people to develop units into apartments or promote schemes such as the previous living over the shop scheme.  The schemes should be made more accessible and more effort should be put into them to encourage people to move back into town centres and to get rid of the blight of disused buildings.<\/p> <p> The Bill proposes to provide greater enforcement powers by local authorities in their collection of rates through the appointment of an authorised officer with the necessary powers to carry out certain duties under the proposed Act.  I am concerned about the proposal because we do not want too much power to be provided.  The vast majority do not mind paying rates.  We paid them.  My late father paid them when there were rates on farms.  Rates were always paid.  With the stroke of a pen, as an election gimmick, a party of which I was a member at the time just wiped them away.  We never recovered.  I celebrated the abolition of rates at the time but it was foolish.  It was devised by Professor Martin O'Donoghue at the time.  He was the first of the so-called messiahs that came along and left us in the mess we are in now.  I do not know where he is now but I hope he is alive and kicking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200036#JJ00400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562091300,"counter":508,"content":"<p>It is good to repent even 40 years later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200037#KK00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091300,"counter":509,"content":"<p>The time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200037#KK00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091300,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I repented long ago because we do not have the money to spend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200037#KK00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091300,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Mattie McGrath want farmers to pay rates again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200037#KK00500","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Farmers always paid their way.

No amendments to the Bill were proposed on Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has asked me to acknowledge in particular the co-operation and support that has been given to this Bill by colleagues and party spokespersons across the House.  It is hoped that, subject to the completion of today's proceedings and the conduct of business as may be agreed by the Houses, the Bill can be completed for enactment before the summer.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is aware, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for an increase in the maximum number of ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal from nine to 15.  The Bill, therefore, provides for an amendment of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 to increase the statutory number of ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal from nine to 15.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the court comprises a President and not more than nine ordinary judges as set down in statute.  There has been no change in this configuration since the court's establishment in 2014.  The Court of Appeal plays a pivotal role in dealing with a whole range of appeals arising from both civil and criminal proceedings across a number of court jurisdictions.  However, we are now at a point where it is clear from the current trend in waiting times that, without additional judges, the Court of Appeal, before too long, will be facing the kind of delays which necessitated its establishment back in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Information received from the Courts Service confirms that, as matters stand, hearing dates for civil cases before the Court of Appeal have already been fixed, up to and including May 2021.  While some allocation has also been made within that schedule so that more urgent appeals can also be dealt with, the time available for civil appeals is essentially fully allocated up to that time.  The President of the Court of Appeal has also highlighted the need for this Bill with the strong support of the Chief Justice.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister, I thank my colleagues for facilitating this Bill and for their co-operation and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200037#KK02300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091300,"counter":530,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is correct that no amendments were tabled on Report Stage.<\/p><p>We have been supportive of this legislation since it was introduced in the House.  It is important.  As the Minister of State has said, the Court of Appeal is an extremely busy court.  Since it was established, it has been very efficient in dealing with appeals from the High Court and in taking the pressure of work off the Supreme Court, which primarily deals with constitutional cases.  It is worthwhile increasing the number of judges in the Court of Appeal to the 15 provided for in this legislation.  At present, there is a delay in hearing a case in the Court of Appeal.  One would be lucky to have a case heard in 2021.  One could probably have a case heard at the end of 2021 if one were seeking it now.  There is a considerable delay in the court and it is important that we do not turn the court into one where there are very lengthy delays.  Individuals are entitled to have their cases heard promptly.  They are also entitled to have their appeals heard properly.  We support the legislation and welcome it.<\/p> <p> I was thinking of tabling an amendment in respect of the retirement age of judges.  I did not do so because I believed it might be complicating for the Government and we want to get the legislation through promptly.  As I said previously to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, there is a strong argument that the retirement age of judges should be increased from 70 to 72.  Previously the age was 72 for judges at the superior courts.  It has been reduced to 70.  Sometimes people do not apply to become a judge until their mid-50s but this results in a disincentive because they do not get their full pension entitlements if they serve only 15 years in the superior courts.  It is a matter that the Government should examine.  People are living longer and are more sprightly.  We should consider allowing judges to serve until they are 72.

They pertain to individuals who would not enjoy the protections of this legislation or any other Act concerning repossession because they would fall within the ambit of receivership.  Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, has experience of the problem, which has the potential to escalate.  It relates to those who bought a property with a mortgage with a view to its being the family home but who, for whatever reason, had to leave it and let it out with a view to using the rent to make mortgage repayments, with every intention of returning to the home in the medium to longer term.  Very often, these individuals are trying their very best to keep up to date with their repayments.  We are trying, through our amendment, to rectify the problem so they will be in a position to benefit from the system.  They have very little protection and are not covered because, since they are not in the property, a receiver can move in.  The proposition is very reasonable.  I realise the Minister has made statements about delays but I do not believe that is the way this process should work.  I understand this is useful legislation and we support it.  It offers vital protection to those it covers.  If the amendment is not accepted, there may not be another appropriate opportunity soon to deal with this issue.  It is important that it has been tabled.  I will be pressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200038#LL01000","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091900,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I wish to speak in support of the amendment.  I acknowledge the work of FLAC on this and its submission on the Bill.  With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will refer to its submission.  It states the issue of the appointment of receivers to properties that are the principal private residence of the borrower has become contentious in recent months, particularly in light of the increasing number of loans that have been sold by the pillar banks to investment and vulture funds.  FLAC has noted this particularly where the borrower has, at some point following the occurrence of arrears, moved out of the property and rented it to a tenant in order to stem the arrears problem and-or attempt to resolve it.  Typically, the borrower will move back to his or her original family home or try to source cheaper accommodation with friends and relatives.  In the cases FLAC has seen, the borrower subsequently pays the full amount of the rent directly to the lender and therefore the appointment of the receiver is arguably unnecessary.  Indeed, as the receiver is deemed to be the agent of the mortgagor or borrower under section 108(2) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, though appointed by the mortgagee or lender, the appointment of the receiver may lead to less money being paid to the lender as the costs of the receiver would be deducted from the rent paid by the tenant to the landlord or borrower.  FLAC believes that in some of these cases the appointment of a receiver is a prelude to evicting the relevant tenants, obtaining vacant possession of the property and then selling it without having to bring legal proceedings to the Circuit Court to repossess it in the normal manner envisaged by the Act of 2009.  This strategy robs a borrower who has acted in good faith, has attempted to deal with the arrears problem and has credible proposals to solve that problem of the opportunity to convince a court that the possession order should not be granted, and it effectively undermines the role of the courts to administer justice.  It also undermines the intention of this Bill, which is to empower the Circuit Court to make the decision as to whether such an order is granted, according to a specific statutory criterion.  The mortgage deed, according to FLAC, will generally provide for the power of the lender to appoint a receiver on the occurrence of specific events, including a default in the payment of instalments.  This is currently backed up by section 108(1) of the Act of 2009, which allows the lender to appoint a receiver in the event of arrears or other breaches of the agreement.  No other conditions are imposed on the exercise of this right.  Subsection (3) allows the receiver to \"exercise any powers delegated by the mortgagee or other person\".<\/p>  <p>  In essence, we are supporting the amendment on the basis of the grounds set out, where there is an intervention whereby the mortgagee may not appoint a receiver without the permission of the Circuit Court.  We believe this complements the Bill and speaks to the spirit of the Bill proposed originally by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran.  It is on that basis that we support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200038#LL01100","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1562091900,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I tabled amendments similar to those tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on Committee Stage.

This amendment is a useful one for people who are property owners, particularly where that property is their primary residence.  We have a situation where under a deed a receiver can be automatically appointed over a residential property without any recourse to the courts.  It has the effect, although that may not be the intention, of circumventing the requirements of going to court for a repossession order.  That is because the receiver's powers simply kick in on foot of a contract entered into by the two parties prior to the appointment of the receiver.

The basic objective of the Bill is to provide adequate protections for people in mortgage arrears in respect of their principal private residences.  This amendment will not help such people in any way for the simple reason that receivers are not appointed to principal private residences.  In this case, as there is no rental income from principal private residences the appointment of the receiver would be of no benefit to the lender.  The rationale behind the proposed amendment appears to be an intention to assist certain borrowers who, for whatever reason, rent their principal private residences with the view of servicing their mortgages.  I should point out that such action may, in itself, be a breach of the mortgage contract entered into by the borrower and the lender.  Such contracts may preclude the renting out of the principal private residences.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I have to add that it is not clear to me how often such a situation arises.  It is clear, however, that the proposed amendment would cover all instances of lenders appointing a receiver and that would include all buy-to-let mortgages.  That would cause difficulties to the Courts Service regarding the demands on the courts' time and the cost of processing applications for court orders.  Requiring lenders to apply for a court order prior to the appointment of the receiver would lead to increased demands on time and costs for the Courts Service.  It should be added that, apart from any statutory powers to appoint a receiver, mortgages usually reserve the contractual rights of the mortgagee to appoint a receiver with the conditions in section 108(1) satisfied.  This amendment seeks to set out the terms that may be contained in the mortgage arrears contract.  It could, if enacted, lead to legal challenge.  If the amendment is passed the Minister has indicated that it will be necessary to obtain legal advice on the matter prior to the Bill returning to the Seanad.  That would, without doubt, delay the passage of this Bill.  I am opposing the amendment for those reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200039#MM00200","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1562092500,"counter":546,"content":"<p>On one hand, the Minister of State has said that it is not clear that this is going to affect many people but on the other hand, he states that it will be a drain on the resources of the courts.

That is not a good enough reason.  It is a reason to provide greater resources to the courts and to ensure they have sufficient resources to be able to apply the laws we pass in the Houses of the Oireachtas.

It will be of benefit to people in the difficult and terrible position of having their houses repossessed and facing those applications before the courts.  We may be able to gain a victory here tonight, be able to state that we managed to get a provision inserted into the Bill and then state that has worked well for Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or the Labour Party.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is not a Fine Gael Minister.  I am concerned, however, that the passing of this amendment would provide the perfect opportunity for Fine Gael to state that this Bill cannot be enacted because there is a necessity to get further legal advice.  Having listened to the Minister of State's last point, and his stance in respect of it, I will not be supporting the amendment.  I may abstain but I will not support it.

The key purpose of the Bill and, I am sure, the intention of the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, is to provide protections for those people.  He stated that such protections are contained in the Bill but I am not convinced that is the case.

I consider the amendment unnecessary since it is clear from the current wording that the section applies to any and all proceedings brought by a mortgagee for possession of land to which section 2 applies.  The amendment adds nothing.  On the contrary, by departing from the existing words in section 2(2), it seems to suggest that the range of mortgages to which section 2A applies is somehow wider than the range to which section 2 applies.  There is a danger that the amendment will create uncertainty in respect of the scope of the Bill.  The wording is inconsistent with the wording of section 2(2) of the 2013 Act.

A judge has to take a number of things into consideration when evaluating legislation.  First and foremost is the text and letter of the legislation.

I am sure judges can also take the intention of the legislature into account.

I respect that, and this is decent legislation.  I acknowledge the good motivations from which the Minister of State works, and I hope the legislation achieves its intended outcome.  However, we are trying to get this Bill through to ensure it helps people, and we are tabling this amendment because we are not sure the Bill applies to all the people we think it should apply to, namely, the tens of thousands of people facing repossession.  We are not confident of that, and if we are proven to be correct in our concerns, then this legislation is unfortunately not worth a great deal.  This could be rectified relatively easily by making it explicitly clear that the legislation applies retrospectively, and the reasons that have been given for not adopting this amendment seem weak.

It is unfortunate that I need to propose this motion in respect of the Mental Health Commission's annual report and the report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services with the intention of keeping mental health on the agenda.  I hoped there would not be a need for it to be kept on the agenda but the reports indicate that there is such a need.  They are comprehensive and highlight some serious areas of concern and failure within our mental health services.  They point to a number of positives as well.  However, in 2019, some 13 years into A Vision for Change, a lot of these issues are totally unacceptable and unnecessary.  They make for stark reading.  <\/p><p>One of the key issues to highlight is that of unregulated facilities.  Similar facilities relating to disability care and physical health are regulated by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, but, in terms of mental health, they are unregulated.  I am concerned about the potential for serious issues to arise in some of these facilities.  There is no reason to fail to have them regulated and assessed.  The reports refer to centres being unfit for purpose or unsuitable.  We had the first ever prosecution under our mental health services in respect of St. Luke's in Kilkenny, which had to be prosecuted because of the lack of care for some of our most vulnerable people.  There is no justification for many of these faults.  <\/p><p>I want to focus also on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  As the Ministers of State will know, this is where the 10% of the most acute circumstances arise that affect our young people's mental health services.  These services again remain seriously understaffed 13 years into what was to be a ten-year plan, A Vision for Change.  Only 57% of staff were found to be <i>in situ<\/i>.  In two areas, CHO 5 and CHO 7, less than 50% of the necessary staff are in place.  Similarly, only 7.6% of the necessary staff are<i>in situ<\/i>in CAMHS for children with intellectual disabilities.  There are no staff to care for such children in three areas - CHO 1, CHO 3 and CHO 6 - comprising almost a third of the country.  This affects children who suffer from autism or Down's syndrome.  Children with intellectual disabilities are four times more likely to suffer a mental health issue and are least able to cope.  There continues to be a long waiting list for children, with 2,500 on it.  The numbers of children admitted to adult units were 84 last year and 68 three years ago; the trajectory is unfortunately in the wrong direction.  I was contacted by a parent whose child was admitted to the Waterford department of psychiatry, DOP, last night and had to be kept on a trolley.  He had been on a hard chair all day because not only is there no place in a child unit but there seems to be no place even in an adult unit for him.  We have the continued situation of no after-hours access.  We have unqualified consultants and we have been waiting a number of years for the Mental Health Act 2001 to be updated; we do not even have the heads of a Bill yet.<\/p><p>On the consequences, in Temple Street Hospital and my local hospital, Wexford general hospital, the number of children being admitted to the emergency department has increased significantly.  Suicide remains the greatest cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 24.  Antidepressant prescription is increasing because general practitioners, GPs, are seeing no other options and there are no other pathways out there.  I am not questioning the <i>bona fides<\/i>of the Minister of State as I know he is doing his very best but I do not get a sense of urgency from the Government.  I do not get the sense that it is prioritising mental health, putting the necessary funds in place or giving him the support he needs.  In a country of 4.5 million people, there should not be a postcode lottery.  We have a population approximately the size of greater Manchester and there should not be such large differences, even in Dublin, between what someone on one side of a street can access and what someone on the other side can.<\/p><p>A clear implementation strategy needs to be rolled out in order that everybody across the country has equal and fair access to services.  The key issues I have highlighted need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200046#TT00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1562095800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Our mental health services are one of the greatest issues of concern to people.  There is increasing concern for the well-being of our young people in particular.  The tragedies that are visiting them in all too great numbers are a worry, with solutions that are too vague and not properly resourced.  The recent annual report of the Mental Health Commission and the report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services make for difficult reading.  The reports are comprehensive and contribute to building a culture of transparency in the mental health services.  They give recognition to improvements as well as deficits within the services monitored.  Nonetheless, the reports highlight many areas of concern and the failures of the mental health service make for stark reading.  There has been significant under-investment in mental health services in recent years.  This must change.  The future of our mental health services cannot be allowed to fall off the Government agenda.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the ongoing crisis in the children's mental health services.  Thirteen years after the publication of A Vision for Change, the services are understaffed.  Too many children continue to be admitted to adult units.  Waiting lists and waiting times are too long and renewed focus is needed to reduce these service deficits.  While early intervention for children with mental health issues is critical, for children with an intellectual disability such as autism or Down's syndrome who also have mental health issues, a lack of early intervention is nothing short of cruel.  Children and adolescents with an intellectual disability are four times more likely to be diagnosed with a mental health problem compared to others their age.  They may find it more difficult to deal with those mental health problems because of their intellectual disability.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the growth of drug use in our communities.  This is both a cause and a result of mental health issues.  In my constituency of Tipperary, there is growing evidence of a serious problem in this area and of its direct link to suicide.  We need acute mental health beds in our county.  We need proper and after hours mental health services in Tipperary.  We need a focused attack on the reasons young people are using illegal drugs to mask their problems and we need proper counselling supports for them and their families to get them away from drugs and into a mental health service that is fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200046#TT00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1562095800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I have been working for some time with my colleagues to bring a motion like this to the House.

I am glad that the motion states it is necessary to respect the wishes of the services users and their families and carers in facilities such as the Rosalie community psychiatric unit.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will know from answering parliamentary questions that people in this unit are mildly mentally handicapped.  They are mainly old and they have been there for many years.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has come down and has met us.  We have had many a hard battle with him but he is a listener and he does try to help.  There are 11 people left in that centre, which initially had 33.

It is not a dilapidated building and it is not a condemned building.  It has been the home of these people for many years.  Despite the best efforts of the politicians and the families, we find that the HSE did not take into account the state of the people, who are vulnerable and need assistance.  The Ministers of State will say the clinicians are the people who know and we cannot contradict them but this motion asserts that in such situations, we must have a better way of doing things.  I believe the Minister of State acknowledges that point.  I will always make the case that it is our job to come into this Chamber to stand up for those who are vulnerable.  In similar future situations, I hope we have to look after people in places such as the Rosalie centre.  I request that the Minister of State allow the 11 people who are still there to live out the rest of their lives there.

I will begin by complimenting the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, for holding the audiovisual room session with Jigsaw some weeks ago.  It was a very welcome opportunity for that organisation to present its stall.  It was also welcome for Oireachtas Members to engage with Jigsaw.  We acknowledge the wonderful work they do.  We need to see that model replicated throughout the State, however that is managed.  Deputy Cahill spoke earlier about Tipperary.  As long as I have been in the House, we have been talking about Tipperary as a model that needs to be rolled out.  Tipperary borders with my native county - we have just a bridge separating us - and mental health issues know no boundaries.  Such a service, be it based in Nenagh or wherever, would be very welcome for the people in Portumna to be able to cross the bridge.  It would free up a huge gap.<\/p>  <p>  On the motion and the Mental Health Commission, I was very startled to hear yet again that young people being admitted to psychiatric units is on the agenda and that yet again, we are listening to their experiences.  We have no idea what it is like to be in those young people's shoes or to be in those particular horrors or what it is like for their mothers, their fathers or their relatives to have to walk away at night leaving their child in an adult unit.  I have first-hand experience of knowing what adult units are like.  It is soul destroying when one walks away and leaves an adult behind but I cannot imagine what it is like to have to leave a child.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, takes to the floor later, will he please indicate what he is going to do about beds, because it is about beds?  Galway has a CAMHS centre but it has only so many beds while supporting 11 counties.<\/p>  <p>  We are fantastic now at talking about wellness and mental health.  There is huge awareness around the issue now.  People know about it and gone are the days of it being a taboo.  People are now able to say that they need help and to ask how they can access help and get support.  People are open to the interventions on offer.  Parents are open to being told that the best thing they can do is walk away and leave it to the professionals if an intervention is required.  They are open to being told they can do no more, they have done the best they can at home but now it is time to let their little ones come in, as the professionals can give them the wraparound supports and by getting that intervention, they can get the young people back on their feet, back into the community, back into school and pushing forward.<\/p>  <p>  It is very hard, however, to do this when there are not enough beds.  Parents are very reluctant to avail of getting that next level of support.  The reason they do not want to get that next level of support is they do not want to have to walk away, leaving their child in a 50-bed unit in University Hospital Galway.  They do not want to leave their child on a stretcher in the accident and emergency department.  Why would they?  If a child is having a particular episode and thinks the whole world is against him or her, then parents are not going to expose the child to an overcrowded accident and emergency room, while telling the child this is the best they have to give him or her.  This mentally scars the children a hell of a lot more.  We actually do the child more harm than good.  We are not giving them support and we are holding them back by donkey's years compared with where we could bring them.  I put it to the Minister of State that early intervention is key.  Consider a young child of ten or 11 years of age with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  We are aware that intellectual disabilities and mental health issues are four times more likely when coupled together like that.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to support the staff who really want to help but who are constrained by the facilities around them and by the fact that they cannot give that help.  Earlier I spoke with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, with regard to primary care settings.  I am a serious advocate for it.  I appreciate that we have made leaps and bounds since 2012 in the delivery of primary care settings.  The first intervention, however, is where it needs to be at.  A situation should not have to become acute where the person might need to get into a hospital bed.   Early intervention is key, especially when one does it through the primary care centre and setting.  One does not need to have all the staff; there is e-health also.  We have moved on.  We do not need to run around looking for the psychiatrist or psychologist.<\/p><p>We can have that space in a proper primary care setting, where that family are totally engaged, switched on and know what is going on.  I was in Australia late last year and I saw exactly how it is done there.  Jigsaw is going out there to look at the best ideas.  My God, it was amazing when I walked into their rooms and saw all they have done.  We can do that too.  We are spending the money but we could put that into the primary care centres.  It is normal for people to talk about their mental health and well-being.  Why would we not integrate that really well within our primary care setting?<\/p> <p> I thought the year we spent on the mental health committee in the bowels of Leinster House was a year well spent.  It was a year spent trawling through the issues, asking questions and getting to understand not just what has come out in this report, but also the Prison Service and so many other services.  It would help any Minister who is in that position to hear it being teased out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200047#UU00400","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562097000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Deputies who have spoken.  On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, I welcome the motion as it highlights the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s role in holding to account our mental health services.  The improvement of mental health services is an important priority for the Government.  The Government supports the commission, providing funding to it of almost &euro;14 million this year.  These reports will help to improve outcomes for service users.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the identified areas of concern, compliance rates have increased over the last two years.  However, we acknowledge that further improvement is needed and the Department of Health will continue to monitor progress made by the HSE in improving compliance.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the new board of the HSE, which held its first meeting last Friday.<\/p>  <p>  It is unacceptable for approved centres to be dirty, and the HSE must ensure that all residents are provided with clean facilities.  We all agree they deserve the best and that this is a basic right.  Seclusion and physical restraint should only be used for the purposes of treating a patient, or to prevent patients from doing harm to themselves or others.  While compliance with seclusion rules is still low, this is improving year-on-year.  The same applies to individual care planning.  The Government will support the HSE and the commission to work together to further improve compliance in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Government notes with concern the findings with regard to the provision of mental health services for children and adolescents.  All referrals are assessed on their clinical presentation and need, and those deemed urgent will be seen as a priority.  Placement of children and adolescents in adult units should only happen where this is the best care option, bearing in mind all circumstances.  The HSE closely monitors such admissions to minimise these.  The HSE is reviewing existing levels of service provision and will examine international models of best practice on the most appropriate models of delivery for use in Ireland.  As has been said, there are problems in recruiting and retaining specialist staff in child and adolescent services.  Efforts are ongoing but there is a shortage of staff at both national and European levels.<\/p>  <p>  The safety and protection of adults who may be at risk of harm is a key objective of the Government.  This is why the Government has approved the development of a national policy on adult safeguarding in the health sector, together with any required legislation.  Work has been ongoing on updating the Mental Health Act 2001 for some time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is pleased to note that, today, a draft of heads of Bill, based on recommendations of the expert group review of the Act, was sent to the Mental Health Commission for its consideration.  This draft represents a detailed and comprehensive piece of work, which aims to improve and modernise certain aspects of the Act in line with international standards.  It is important to stress that this is a phase in a process, with the commission likely to require a period of approximately six months to study and comment on the draft heads.<\/p>  <p>  Included in the draft heads are new provisions to allow for regulation by the commission of mental health community residences.  I should point out that while such residences are not currently subject to regulation, the commission has the authority to inspect them and recommend improvements which, where possible, the HSE will respond to.  In addition, the updated Act will include new text on the provision of information for voluntary patients, given access to such information for involuntary patients is already provided for in the Act.  Furthermore, the draft heads include the recognition of rights of 16 year olds and 17 year olds to have an equal say over their mental health care as with physical health.<\/p>  <p>  The motion refers to the Rosalie unit in Roscommon.  The HSE consulted widely with patients and families on the provision of alternative care arrangements, as well as taking account of an independent clinical and evidence-based report.  On modernisation of care settings, &euro;3 million was allocated for minor capital works in 2018 to help improve mental health facilities.  Almost &euro;1 billion was allocated to the HSE&rsquo;s mental health services for 2019 and funding has increased by over &euro;270 million since 2012.  A Vision for Change has provided the framework for mental health policy since 2006.  A refresh of this policy is nearing completion and will provide a roadmap for the future of mental health policy in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the continued development of a high-quality mental health service for all.  While we all agree there is some way to go on this, it is not true to say nothing has been done.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has worked tirelessly on many mental health issues since he came into office and I am sure that, in his closing remarks, he will be able to address some of the issues raised by Deputies.  We will not be opposing the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200048#VV00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1562097000,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To insert the following after &ldquo;advance healthcare directives respected;&rdquo;:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;- the reinstatement of the post of National Director for Mental Health to provide accountability, transparency and strong national leadership for mental health;<br \/><br \/>- the development of an information system for mental health, starting with basic indicators so that outcomes can be tracked and monitored;<br \/><br \/>- a statutory footing for the right to a care plan;<br \/><br \/>- the publication, before the end of 2019, of a costed implementation plan for the provision of 24\/7 CAMHS;<br \/><br \/>- no freeze on recruitment or overtime for psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists and other essential staff;<br \/><br \/>- an immediate commencement of the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 in whole or in part so that people&rsquo;s basic rights are protected; and<br \/><br \/>- an immediate commencement of the sections of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, relating to Advance Healthcare Directives and the extension of that right, through new legislation, to involuntary patients.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>I wish to share time with Deputies Cullinane, Martin Kenny, Ellis and &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200048#VV00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1562097000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I would also like to take the opportunity to commend the proposed Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, which I believe is very much in keeping with the spirit of the motion and adds positively to it, with policies for which Fianna F&aacute;il has recently expressed support.  I thank Deputy Browne and Fianna F&aacute;il for accepting our amendment.  We will see the value in these additions, which were developed in conjunction with mental health campaigners.<\/p>  <p>  There are deep-rooted societal impacts on mental health which can only be addressed fully by policies which pursue an end to the economic and political model which enshrines inequality, poverty and isolation.  That said, I believe that all in this House, from all political perspectives, can and should agree at least that mental health services deserve investment and that people who use those services deserve dignity and effective care within the service.<\/p>  <p>  I was not shocked at what I read in the Mental Health Commission report because it is something which my work in mental health for many years has made me all too aware of.  At the core, this is an issue of rights.  We talk about patients' rights in this context but, really, they are simply the rights of all people to care, should they need it.  We do not have that system today, as this report and this motion remind us.  There is no dignity in a dirty, smelly, broken down ward.  There is no dignity in a four-bedroom dorm with no privacy for adults in mental health distress.  There is no dignity in a child being placed in an adult ward or, worse still, sleeping on a chair, as has happened for lack of an appropriate bed.  Where is the care and dignity when over two thirds of patients do not have care plans in compliance with regulation?<\/p>  <p>  With no dignity comes no hope.  There is no hope when long-term patients have no rehabilitation teams, as is the case for 39% of them.  There is no hope in waiting lists for care which put lives at risk and see children become adults before an appointment is met.  In that indignity and hopelessness, we find staff who have trained for years to dedicate their lives to care being let down by a system and a Government that, quite frankly, undervalues them, overworks them and does not listen to them.<\/p>  <p>  Many things can impact a person's mental health negatively but mental health services should not be one of them for patients, families or staff.<\/p><p>We cannot continue down this road.  The solution is not simple or cheap, but the cost of not acting will be greater.  We need accountability with, as promised, a new director of mental health in the HSE, a new Oireachtas committee on mental health and a new mental health Act, which enshrines dignity, respect and hope as the right of all who seek care in the services.  We demand clarity on the progress towards 24-7 services, with an implementation process that sets out funding and has firm but ambitious deadlines.  We need a statutory right to a collaborative and empowering care plan and to advanced healthcare directives for all patients with capacity.<\/p> <p> Nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists and other therapeutic professions demand the respect their work deserves, the ability to do that work in Ireland, to live in comfort at home and to safety at work.

It is always good to debate mental health services in this House.  I want to focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in University Hospital Waterford, UHW, and the lack of facilities in that service.<\/p>  <p>  The south east lost a number of adult psychiatrists over the past number of years.  One of them resigned his post because he recognised that the services were lacking and that the building and services in place were not what children who need the supports of a child psychiatrist and CAMHS should get.  The Mental Health Commission, on a number of occasions, found that the inpatient mental health facility at UHW was high risk and, critically, that it was non-compliant with regulations relating to the maintenance of records and the use of their selection.  It also found in a previous inspection that children and adults were being placed in what it called \"a dirty and dusty seclusion room\".  It was not fit for purpose.  We have had reports of children in adult wards, including a report in 2017 of a 16 year old girl who was left in a chair overnight in an adult psychiatric ward and who was horrified by her plight.  I am sure her family were as well.  All of this demonstrates a lack of capacity in the system.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for every problem in the mental health service, no more that I do not blame the Minister, Deputy Harris, for every problem in our health service but there are serious capacity issues.  The regulator, in this case the Mental Health Commission, has made it known time and again, year after year, that there are serious problems in terms of capacity, buildings that are not fit-for-purpose, children in adult words and a lack of psychiatrists.  Psychiatrists are leaving UHW because they cannot work in that environment.  When St. Senan's Hospital in Wexford closed, patients were sent to Waterford for services, but because no additional capacity had been put in place, the Waterford services became overcrowded and patients throughout the south east were told to attend the services in Cork.  These people need supports immediately when they are having an episode or when there is a risk to their lives.  They need immediate access to services but it is not available to them in most cases.  This is the reality for many patients.  Much more needs to be done.  The Government needs to wake up on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the authors of the motion and I support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200049#WW00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1562097600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Over the past couple of years, I have raised many issues with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, in regard to mental health services in the north west, in particular CAMHS.  He is well aware of the situation there.  It is probably at 50% capacity and has been that way for a long time.  This is having a major impact on families and young people who run into difficulties.  The service is, at best, a skeleton service.  Often, nobody answers when people telephone the service.<\/p>  <p>  A gentleman spoke to me recently about his child who is on medication that has to be reviewed every six months.  He cannot even make contact by telephone with the CAMHS unit to make an appointment to have that medication reviewed.  When he made contact, he was told to contact his GP.  The GP told that him that because he did not prescribe the medication, he could not review it.  This is the type of problem that exists in our mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  We also have a serious issue in regard to the school-age psychiatrist service.  It is non-existent as well.  When a psychiatrist is available, he or she is only available for a short time.  A child might meet a psychiatrist once a week for six or eight weeks and having built up trust, the psychiatrist is replaced by a locum to do the same job again.  This inconsistency is causing significant difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  On adult services, I welcome the proposed new mental health unit for Sligo University Hospital.  It is hoped it will be open this time next year.  However, there will be 12% fewer beds in that unit than currently exist, which means a decrease in capacity.  At the same time, owing to staffing issues, there has not, and will not be, a service in the community.  When I talk to officials in the HSE and the mental health services, they say they cannot find staff to fill vacant positions.  They are very frustrated with the situation.  We need a new focus and a redirection of energy and, particularly, resources to ensure that we provide for the people who need this service, particularly those in the north west and the Sligo region, which is in serious crisis in regard to mental health services.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, about this and I know he is doing his best but, at the end of the day, somewhere or other there is a blockage in the system that is not delivering for people.  That blockage needs to be removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200049#WW00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1562097600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt dom r&uacute;n seo agus na leasuithe at&aacute; againn.  We can all agree that the results of the annual report of the Mental Health Commission should give us cause for concern.  Unfortunately, it comes as no surprise that there are serious problems in the mental health services.  We should be especially concerned about the continuing inadequate service for children and adolescents.  It is unacceptable that children under the age of 16 are still being placed in adult units.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  In general, the services that are available are poor in quality and, very often, vary in standards.  Progress in improving these services has been slow or has not happened at all.<\/p>  <p>  We should also be concerned that the existing services are badly funded and are not responding adequately to the needs of the children or their families.  These vital services are further constrained by the moratorium on recruitment.  We also have a retention crisis in mental health services.  I have been told that there are more staff leaving the mental health service than any other area in the health sector.  There are insufficient numbers of qualified staff, such as psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivery of a 24-7 mental health service has not been met.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, mental health services are available Monday to Friday on a 24-7 basis, but they are not available round the clock on Saturdays and Sundays.  There have been many instances of people with suicidal ideation being turned away from emergency departments.  The Government gave a commitment that there would be a psychiatrist available these departments on a 24-7 basis.  Those who present with mental health issues, however, generally have to wait a number of hours before being seen by a psychiatrist.  In my experience, during the time the individual waits to see the psychiatrist their condition may change and improve, which leads to the possibility of him or her being sent home without before being seen by the psychiatrist in their original distressed condition.  This can lead to a false analysis of the individual&rsquo;s true mental state.  This also can happen when he or she presents at a Garda station.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other issues I could highlight if I had the time.  Staff in mental health services work hard under difficult circumstances.  The staff and those who use the services need the best supports and the best facilities in place.  Unfortunately, this is not the case at the moment.  I commend Mental Health Reform, Dr. Shari McDaid and her team, who have been to the fore in highlighting mental health issues over the years.  We are indebted to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200049#WW00400","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1562097600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I recently had a meeting with some of the leadership team of HSE south-southwest.<\/p><p>I asked people on my social media network what issues I should raise.  There were others but one of the most common was mental health.  It is an issue of significant concern to a wide range of the population.  There are significant issues in adult services, with waiting times and the frequency with which people are seen.  There was significant concern about the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Approximately 650 children are on the waiting list in Cork, of whom 115 were waiting for more than one year at the end of last year.  There is obviously prioritisation, but it is unconscionable and unacceptable that a child is waiting for more than 12 months to be seen.  We are putting people at risk with such waiting times.  They are facing difficult circumstances and concerned.  Their families are worried and they need to be seen and receive the support they are not getting.  I accept that there is increased demand and I am sure it can be said there is a need for a whole-of-government and perhaps a whole-of-society approach, but the way society is developing is causing increased mental health problems.  There is also the stark fact that the resources are not available.  In north Lee there is a gap.  There has been no psychologist in place since early 2017.  The team in the south west of Cork is operating at approximately 42% of the strength at which it should be operating under A Vision for Change.  The numbers and staff are not available.  That is causing the waiting lists people face and the follow-up is not always to the standard people expect.  Sometimes people are seen, but it is very rushed.  Then they are dissatisfied, which is a serious issue.<\/p> <p> I want to give credit where credit is due for the work HSE south-southwest is doing with a new initiative in CAMHS for people with eating disorders.  It is positive and I commend it.<\/p> <p> An issue has been raised with me anecdotally, for which I cannot provide statistics.  We are producing many psychology graduates.  The route to becoming a clinical psychologist is very difficult and expensive.  To gain the experience and training required, a person often has to engage in an unpaid placement.  That issue needs to be looked at since it means that only people from a wealthy background or the very talented can gain that experience.  That is a blockage which needs to be examined and removed.  Many want to be clinical and consultant psychologists, but it is a difficult route, rightly so to a point.  However, there are blockages with which we can deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200049#WW00500","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562098200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I commend the motion on behalf of the Labour Party.  We have tabled an amendment in a genuine attempt to strengthen the motion.  The findings made in the Mental Health Commission's report go a long way towards highlighting the significant governance and management problems in services, but the report deals primarily with the top tiers of the pyramid of mental health care services.  These should be the services of last resort, but recently they have tended to be the only service delivered, which is a problem.  I speak regularly to providers and practitioners on the ground who tell me the same story about people who are forced to present at acute services such as CAMHS owing to the absence of primary care services.  In many cases, they have reached a crisis point owing to the absence of early intervention services.  We see this not only in mental health services but across all services.  Our motion on carers last week was yet another example of the overuse of expensive acute services and the underuse of cost-effective and efficient primary care servoces.  We then wonder why Ireland has one of the highest health spends in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, yet it has some of the worst health outcomes among advanced countries.  The problem is not with the quality of staff in the HSE or overall resources, as evidenced by the current overruns.  The problem is that we lack an holistic strategy for mental health services at Government level and a coherent system to match the objectives set out in A Vision for Change.<\/p>  <p>  Young people are experiencing unprecedented levels of anxiety and stress in their everyday lives.  Everything has changed in the past ten years.  Up to one third now experience mental health difficulties and, shockingly, suicide remains the most frequent cause of death among those aged 15 to 24 years.  We need to ask why these difficulties are arising among young people.  The increase in inequality is one reason.  The evidence shows that unequal societies have greater rates of mental distress.  As the gap between rich and poor in society continues to widen, so too does the number experiencing mental health difficulties.  There is also obviously a serious social cost.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps it is better to speak in a language the Government will understand.  Economically, the cost of the mental health crisis was put at &euro;8.3 billion by the OECD in 2018.  To put it in context, that is approximately half the total health budget.  We need a radical change of direction.  We need to see expenditure on mental health services not as a cost but as an investment.  That is why the upcoming budget should, at a minimum, increase mental health spending in line with what was set out in A Vision for Change.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment calls for a paradigm shift in the delivery of mental health services.  We need to move from a reactive approach based on expensive acute care to a preventive and proactive approach based on community-led, cost-effective early interventions.  That is the most important thing I will say to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and I think he agrees with me.  To achieve this, we need an holistic, integrated approach by the Government that moves beyond narrow economic measures to focus on societal well-being.  A simple but relevant example is trees in a city.  Researchers have repeatedly found evidence of improved mental health from exposure to nature.  We all know that a walk in the park reduces our stress levels and improves our mood and mental health.  Ultimately, more trees means reduced treatment costs and improved worker productivity.  That is just a tiny example.  As part of the BusConnects plan, more than 1,000 trees will be felled.  Where is the joined-up thinking?  Meanwhile other European cities such as Paris are planning the development of urban forests in city centre locations.  The Government's approach shows a lack of joined-up thinking in these measures.<\/p>  <p>  We need to redirect spending to primary level interventions that have nipped problems in the bud.  Let me give an example.  I recently attended a CAMHS briefing which I think the Minister of State may have hosted.  This figure was prominent and is worth emphasising.  According to the HSE mental health division, 90% of mental health needs could be successfully treated within a primary care setting.  That is a fraction of the cost and would reduce the burden on top-tier psychological services.<\/p>  <p>  Let me give another example from another briefing I attended.  I recently spoke to representatives from Jigsaw, of which I am a supporter and about which I have spoken to the Minister of State.  It provides an excellent early intervention service for young people.  Some 71% of those aged 17 to 25 years who came through its doors saw a reduction in the levels of their psychological distress.  We have spent a long time trying to roll out these excellent services.  I hope there will soon be an announcement of a location for the Jigsaw service in County Tipperary since a decision was made to provide one there.  The service has supported more than 30,000 young people and upskilled more than 200,000 adults to foster support of young people's mental well-being.  The models are in place and we know that we can produce results if we can expand the services provided.  The Minister of State should turn the ship around in the port, let the service be community led and ensure it is facing the community, rather than concentrating on acute services.<\/p>  <p>  Services suffer from the silo effect within the system in which they operate in the HSE.  Let us consider, for example, a person who is aged over 18 years who presents to Jigsaw but needs a referral to CAMHS.  Under the current system, he or she will need to be sent back to his or her doctor for a referral letter.  This means another layer of bureaucracy, a day off work, another &euro;50 to be paid in general practitioner fees, etc.  The Minister of State sees where I am going with this.  I do not think that is necessary.  In reality, the person may never present again to his or her doctor for a referral letter.  Is there any way the Minister of State can quantify the number of such events?  I am not sure if it is possible to do so, but it would be interesting to know.  What is happening is that they will present again later with a more severe problem because they will be lost in the loop.<\/p>  <p>  We should not put bureaucratic or cost barriers in the way of people in mental distress.  It should not matter which door a person walks in through.  He or she should not have to worry about the convoluted way in which he or she will access services.  He or she should just be able to access them.  The mental health service should be seamlessly integrated, with different providers having the ability to refer to the most appropriate service in a timely manner.<\/p><p> The Labour Party generally supports the findings by the Mental Health Commission and the implications outlined within the motion, but we believe it is time we moved beyond painting over the cracks.  We all know the old adage that prevention is better than cure.  It is very simple.  Staffing resources and adequate governance must be addressed at every level of mental health care, but as I have repeatedly said, we need to turn the ship around, get rid of bureaucracy and make it face towards the community rather than its current top tier, which is acutely driven.  The service does not work to the level required and is also overtly expensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200050#XX00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562098800,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.

That relates to the Rosalie home in Castlerea in west Roscommon.  Back in 2015, the Health Service Executive and the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Kathleen Lynch, apologised to the residents of the unit for the manner in which a clinical assessment was carried out without their knowledge or the consent of the next of kin.  The assessment was used as a justification for the closure of the long-stay residential unit.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, a similar clinical assessment was carried out with the same purpose in mind, again without consent.

This is probably our tenth debate on mental health and, unfortunately, as a previous speaker pointed out, things do not change.  That is especially the case in the Roscommon-Galway area where we have had nothing but closures and services being taken away.  Day care centres were closed, hostels were closed and then we had the news about the Rosalie unit.  This debacle has gone on for four or five years.  There has been indecision and families have been treated in an abhorrent way.  The manner in which patients and their families have not been given information and things have not been done in a transparent way is disgusting.  The people in the Rosalie unit, which is a fine facility, have been there for many years and deserve to stay there.  On top of that, we also have a situation in the acute unit in Roscommon in that step-down facilities are not provided.  Unfortunately, it seems that people in the services in Roscommon get promoted for closing places.  That is what seems to be emerging.  They are putting middle-aged people in nursing homes who should not be there.<\/p>  <p>  It is great if one can have the services in the community, but while we talk about it we are not resourcing it or supplying the service in the community.  At the same time we are closing the different facilities that made life that little bit easier, be it in Ballaghaderreen, Athleague, Strokestown or wherever else in the county.  I ask the Minister of State to have a comprehensive look at what is going on.  He should take an overview of what has happened in Roscommon especially and give people dignity and treat them with respect.  I do not blame the Minister of State but everything is pushed over to clinicians.  They seem to be the saviours of the world.  Unfortunately, my reading of it is that families and the patients know more than many of the so-called experts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200051#YY00300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1562098800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I am pleased we are having a debate on this topical issue, which has been debated at length in this Chamber.  It is good that we are having the debate today.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission's report makes for very sombre reading.  About an hour ago I read some of the observations made by the commission.  I will refer to four.  If they do not worry people, then nothing will.  The first relates to physical restraint and seclusion.  The report states that just 19% of centres were compliant with the relevant code of practice.  The second is that 40% of approved centres were non-compliant with the regulations on the need for individual care plans.  The third relates to a shortage of mental health staff, which comes under the narrative relating to the retention of staff.  Even more worrying is what was said about 24-hour supervision in approved centres for young people.  The commission's observation is that the residences are not regulated and leave residents open to the risk of abuse.  The report, to say the least, is unbelievably grim.  I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, personally, because I do not make things personal.  The report is very worrying for young people when they access mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  The observations get worse.  The report stated that 70% of approved centres were poorly maintained.  Some of them were not even fit for purpose and 40% were non-compliant on the need for individual care plans.  Something is dramatically wrong if individual care plans are not provided for the young people in the care of the centres.  Nearly 84 children and adolescents were admitted to 18 adult units this year.  It is quite incredible that this is going on.  The levels of compliance and deficits in care are very worrying.  The absence of regulation leaves residents open to abuse.  The report makes bad reading for young people listening to the debate tonight.  As other Members have said, there is a crisis in the health service and in mental health services in this country.  In some ways the staff are trying to do their best, but the lack of retention of staff is having a big effect on the delivery of the service.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency we received two pieces of bad news about mental health services.  The adult mental health services in Clondalkin is due to close and to move to Tallaght.  To compound that, the Jigsaw youth mental health service in Clondalkin is also to move to Tallaght.  Along with other Deputies from the constituency, I indicated that it was a significant mistake to move Jigsaw from Clondalkin.  It is a successful service and it does not make sense to move it to a different area.  I hope the decision will be reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  A Vision for Change was visionary in some ways, although it was gathering dust for 13 years.  It was visionary to state what we need to have in a mental health service that complies with the 21st century.  We are nowhere near that.  Having read the observations, the onus is on the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to review fully mental health services for young people in this country because the report is damning.  It is up to the Government to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200051#YY00400","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1562098800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Progress has been made on mental health issues.  I refer to correspondence from Mental Health Reform in which it acknowledges that the Minister of State will send a draft update of the mental health legislation to it in July.<\/p><p>It outlines the work it has been doing on guidelines relating to ethnic minorities and improvements in building a culture of transparency.  I feel, having been here for ten years now, that we are saying the same things and going around in circles when it comes to mental health.<\/p> <p> The outstanding issue is A Vision for Change and its full implementation.  It was so lauded when it was introduced but we are still waiting on implementation.  There has been very slow progress on implementing every aspect.  There was an independent review mechanism that worked for two terms.  We are looking at all this but it has now gone.  Where is the independent review?<\/p> <p> It is the survivor groups from the institutions who have the phrase, \"Nothing about us without us.\"  That could also be applied to those with mental health issues so they can be part of whatever services are being provided.<\/p> <p> Yesterday I attended a seminar addressing substance use and misuse in the north-east inner city.  The HSE was outlining the improvements planned for health services, covering factors such as a new case management tool and a new inclusion hub where a range of services will be provided.  It was using terms such as \"outcomes-based accountability\" and \"ensuring the service is making a difference\".  This represents a positive way forward but the theory must be applied to individual cases and to the reality.  It is as if we know what to do but that doing it is problematic.<\/p> <p> An area of need I wish to refer to is dual diagnosis.  This is a very real issue for those with both an addiction and mental health issue.  When a person presents with an addiction to an addiction service, the service is not provided once it is realised there is a mental health issue.  Likewise, when a person presents with a mental health issue to a mental health service and it is realised that an addiction is involved, that is the end of the service.  The mental health issue could range from psychosis or bipolar disorder to depression or an anxiety disorder.  The difficulty is that mental health and addiction services are not treating people holistically because they are treating the condition instead of the person.  I acknowledge there is work and research taking place in DCU, but in the meantime, people with both a mental health issue and an addiction are just not receiving the service they need.  The reality is that two thirds of those who have died by suicide had both an addiction and mental health issues.<\/p> <p> The last point I wish to make is about child and adult mental health services.  The staffing level is 57% of that recommended in A Vision for Change.  I once mentioned talking to some teaching friends about their experience of the child and adult mental health services.  One said the experience is positive once the child is assessed and is in the service.  Another asked what a child has to do to be guaranteed access to the service in a swift manner.  That teacher said the service is more reactive than preventive.  Of course, the communication leaves schools at a distance because the referral is made by a general practitioner, yet the child is probably attending school and the school is left out of it.  As others have said, it is about joining the dots on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200051#YY00500","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562099400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Unfortunately Ireland has a dark and disturbing history when it comes to the mass institutionalisation of people with mental health problems.  It is only in recent history that the State has begun a broad shift away from this model of care.  However, according to the Mental Health Commission, the law in its current form is still outdated and outmoded and is not based on a progressive rights-based approach to mental health care.  The commission's most recent report highlights significant governance and management deficits within mental health services.  Other concerns relate to hygiene and maintenance levels, levels of compliance, the use of physical restraint of young people, seclusion, and 70% of approved centres registered with the Mental Health Commission remaining dirty and poorly maintained.<\/p>  <p>  On upgrading legislation, it is vital that there be reform soon.  Advocates have continued to call for legislation to be published no later than the end of this year.  Irish legislation is still without key aspects.  Specific guiding principles for children are not in the 2001 Act.  Individuals do not yet have a statutory right to individual care or recovery plans.  Voluntary patients still do not have basic rights to information or advocacy.  While those aged 16 and 17 can consent to or refuse physical healthcare decisions, this right does not apply to mental healthcare decisions.  Most poignantly in the context of this debate, involuntary patients do not have the right to have their advance wishes about treatment respected, leading every year to the detention of between 2,000 and 2,500 people against their will in psychiatric facilities where they can be forcibly injected with medication, physically restrained by staff and locked in isolation.  It is clear that despite reforms made in recent years, the State retains a disproportionate amount of power over individuals with mental health issues.  The use of control and coercion must be examined as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has repeatedly called for serious attention to be paid to the human rights of mental health service users in terms of capacity and consent to treatment.  The main obstacle to greater reform is the fact that State funding has been in crisis, largely due to decades of chronic underinvestment and the inability to recruit and retain staff providing the care.  If we decide on everything based on money, we will have serious problems and have them continuously.  Waiting lists are long and demeaning.  The longer people have to wait to receive mental healthcare, the more problems they face.  The commission's annual report also revealed that 84 children were admitted to adult mental health centres in 2018.  This is absolutely unacceptable over 13 years after A Vision for Change was published.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the number on the waiting list for child and adult mental health services in Donegal is at an all-time high, with no sign of it dissipating.  This is due to inadequate staffing levels.  Some are waiting more than a year to be assessed, and that is before they get into the system to receive proper care.  We should be at a stage where 24-7 child and adult mental health services are in full effect and fully resourced but we are far from that reality.  The current services are not meeting the needs of young people and their families.  They have been shockingly underfunded for quite some time.  The failure to recruit and retain staff is hampering efforts also, yet the Government does not seem to be doing anything to address this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget the young people in third level education.  Record numbers of third level students are receiving counselling for mental health problems, such as anxiety.  However, the number of counsellors per student, one for every 2,600, is very low by comparison with the recommended ratio agreed by the International Association of Counselling Services, which states there should be one councillor for 1,000 to 1,500 students.  This means students often end up waiting for weeks before they can gain access to a counsellor.  The latest figures show waiting times vary, between seven and 40 working days, depending on individual colleges.<\/p>  <p>  One reason for the dire state of our mental health services is ideological.  The Government does not believe in the right to healthcare based on need rather than ability to pay.  That is the crux of the problem.  Instead, the Government continues to invest in a two-tier health system that consistently undermines public services.  Despite this, the Government continues to support the structure as opposed to winding it down, and staff are moving away from public care to private care.<\/p>  <p>  It took over a decade for Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I hope it is not taking another decade to reform our mental health services so the human rights of all those with mental health issues can be protected.  The Minister of State must address this on a human rights basis, focusing on the right to treatment and not the cost of treatment.  That is the only way to sort this out once and for all.  I would love to hear in the D&aacute;il the actual cost of having a health service that is fit for purpose rather than one that meets the arbitrary budgetary figures picked every year for it.  That would be refreshing in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1562099400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>With regard to the Mental Health Commission report, particularly in respect of CHO area 3, the mid-west, the acute psychiatric unit in Ennis had a compliance rate of 73% and that in Limerick had a rate of 72%.  This is very disappointing.  It relates to pressure of work, old infrastructure and staff shortages.  I do not believe it relates to professionalism.  The shortcomings relate to cleanliness, of course, but also to a lack of dignity, privacy, respect and safety.  I refer not only to the safety of patients but also to the safety of staff.  The contributing factors are the volume of acute admissions and the lack of inpatient beds.  Ireland has 22 beds per 100,000 members of the population whereas the EU average is 70.  The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care recommended that the ratio be increased to 50:100,000 by 2021, and to 70:100,000 in 2023.  There is a great need for capital investment to improve our infrastructure.  With our improved infrastructure, we will attract staff into our service.  Unfortunately, we are not doing that at present.<\/p>  <p>  Not only does Ennis cover the catchment area of County Clare but also the catchment area of south Tipperary since the acute unit in south Tipperary was closed a number of years ago.

This leads to a lack of continuity and tenure, which does not allow the service to develop.  It is only filling a gap.  In other cases, non-specialists are acting up to fill a gap.  That is not an ideal solution and not the solution to the staffing crisis.  The other issues that pertain are in respect of community services.  Community psychiatric services are lacking community nurses, occupational therapy, psychological therapy, counselling and social work support.  This also pertains to the Kilrush area, where there is a great lack of staff within the community team. This is unsustainable and also leads to an over-prescription of medication.

I invite him now because there are other issues with which we want him to deal in County Kerry and I look forward to seeing him visiting as soon as possible.  I especially compliment the people who work in the mental health services in County Kerry.  I served for seven or eight years on the psychiatric services committee of the old Southern Health Board.

A gap arises in the services where a person is going into adulthood but is perhaps neither a child nor an adult.  The Minister of State knows as well as I do that there is a deficiency in the service in that respect.  Parents are left in a traumatised state with a young person in the house under their care who is neither a child nor an adult.  Those people need very special care and attention.  We are failing to give them that care.  There are failings in the system and it is not the fault of the people working in the service.  It is us as legislators, the HSE and the governance that needs to be addressed to ensure that facilities and services will be put in place to take care of those youngsters and to mind them every day.  That is needed because we could lose them in a shot and we do not want to lose anybody.  Losing one person is too much.  Every county and every family is affected by suicide and similar issues.

It is wrong to put those youngsters into that environment.  We should be striving to get away from that situation.  All of our hospitals should be examined and new systems put in place to deal with these scenarios.  Some of these young people need one-to-one professional care and to talk with trained psychiatrists.  Invariably, those services are not readily enough available.

Only last week, I broke a story I had known about for some time.  It concerned our mental health facility known as the centre for mental health care and recovery in Bantry.  It is an acute admission unit, which services the west Cork population of more than 50,000 people.  The service also has a community mental health team, consisting of community-based mental health nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists etc.  In recent weeks, I have spoken about the real facts concerning the conditions in that facility where staff numbers are at an all-time low and the staff members are stretched to the limit.  I am blowing the whistle on what can only be called awful management at the centre for mental health care and recovery in Bantry.<\/p>  <p>  There is a major staffing crisis in the unit.  The answer to that problem from management was to pull staff from working in the community.  The community staff ensure that people stay out of hospital.  I am referring to people who need a multitude of different support systems.  Agency staff are being brought from Cork city and being accommodated in a local hotel to fill the staff shortages.  The morale on the ward has never been worse with many staff going off sick with stress.  Those who have spoken to me have no one to turn to.  They know that they would be in danger of being sacked if they are traced or their identity becomes known.<\/p>  <p>  Only last week, the Mental Health Commission released a report, which I have to hand, on Bantry mental health services.  A drop of 10% in areas across the services has been recorded since another report was carried out in 2017.  If we look closely at the report, and I have looked as closely as I can in the time I have had, it is easy to see why.  It is simply down to staff shortages.  I will be keeping a very close eye on how this issue will be dealt with in future and watching to ensure that no witch-hunt takes place.  The wrong that is ongoing in the centre for mental health care and recovery in Bantry should be rectified.  The great pressure on the staff should be eased and the happy working atmosphere that used to exist in the unit should be restored.<\/p>  <p>  I know that recruitment and retention of staff in an area like west Cork can be challenging for management.  It might help to alleviate the situation if certain steps were taken.  Are contracts being offered to each group of students graduating?  Are they being offered the opportunity to work in areas like west Cork?  Is there a policy to protect community services?  Can staff be reassured that if they make a complaint in good faith that they will not be penalised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200053#AAA00600","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1562100000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Browne on bringing forward this important motion.  I confirm my support for it and for the amendments tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is important to state we have come a long way.  Both of my parents were psychiatric nurses who started in the service in the early 1930s at St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel, which was then known as a lunatic asylum.  At its height, that institution had more than 1,200 patients.  It was a very different place in those days than it is today.  My dad joined the service as a warder.  There were no nurses in those days.  He qualified as a nurse afterwards, as did my mother.  Restraint was then the treatment method employed at the time.  Indeed, my father often said that he regretted the restraint methods they had to use in those early days.<\/p>  <p>  That generation, however, was also the one that started challenging the whole idea of stigma surrounding mental health.  That was the generation that removed the huge walls around psychiatric hospitals.  They took down the gates, welcomed in the community and invited it into the hospital.  I remember well that there was a local pitch and putt club on the grounds of St. Luke's' Hospital.  Members of the public were invited in and patients in turn began to go out into the community.  They went on day trips to the cinema and to the circus.  Eventually, some patients came to live independent lives in houses in the community.<\/p><p>That was the beginning of community-based services.  Staff in mental health services, both past and present, have been exceptional, but current staff are under immense pressure due to underfunding and a lack of personnel.  As a result, it is difficult to recruit and retain staff.<\/p> <p> It is important to refer to the various volunteers whose work in this area is considerable and valuable.  Our area has organisations such as Community Suicide Awareness Workers, C-SAW, the River Suir suicide patrol and Taxi Watch, and there are many others around the country.  We should recognise the essential work that they do.  They should be supported.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the involvement of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, his engagement with local issues on the ground, and, in particular, his approval of the Jigsaw project for Tipperary.  I spoke to those involved in the project recently.  We will shortly meet them to discuss the programme's implementation on the ground.<\/p> <p> It is a case of a lot done but an awful lot more to do.  The report of the Mental Health Commission as well as the reports on individual acute units are very disturbing, in particular against the background of increasing mental health issues in the community generally, especially among young people where self-harm and suicide are increasing at an alarming rate.  The reports are also disturbing in light of the fact that there is a plan for a seamless mental health service.  That plan, A Vision for Change, has been there since 2006.  Unfortunately, that document is still not implemented 13 years later.  It was a far-seeing policy and might have been before its time.  It addressed all of the various areas, for example, early intervention, 24-7 services, community care, talk therapies, day care, crisis services, emergency services and acute beds.  It is a pity that A Vision for Change has not been implemented.  That policy is the key to putting in place good quality health services for the community.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State is well aware of it, but I must refer to a particularly difficult situation in Clonmel in Tipperary where services were devastated in 2012 following the closure of the St. Michael's acute unit.  When it closed, south Tipperary patients were sent to Kilkenny and north Tipperary patients were sent to Ennis, but those units were overcrowded and not fit for purpose.  The Kilkenny unit has been prosecuted and convicted in recent times following a Mental Health Commission report.  It is also difficult for south Tipperary patients to be admitted to that unit.  Even when they are, they are discharged early.  Due to the need to travel, family support is almost non-existent, despite the fact that it is key to helping patients improve and recover.  At the time, we were promised a Rolls-Royce community service, but that did not happen either.  We now have community teams that are significantly understaffed.  For instance, 19 nursing posts and a number of other healthcare professional posts are vacant.  We were promised a new crisis house.  Seven years later, we appear to be no nearer to it.  As other Members have stated, there are particular difficulties in respect of patients with mental health issues attending emergency departments of our general hospitals.  Young people are being admitted to adult wards.  At one point not so long ago in Tipperary, one third of our paediatric beds were taken up by young people with mental health issues.<\/p> <p> These are some of the issues affecting Tipperary.  They need to be addressed urgently.  The bigger national picture needs to be addressed as well.  A Vision for Change should be the foundation for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200053#AAA00700","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562100600,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I congratulate Deputy Browne on his tireless efforts advocating on behalf of patients and the families of those who suffer mental health issues.  Not only has he repeatedly pointed out the failures on the part of the Government, he has been to the fore in proposing solutions.  For example, last year's Bill would have ensured that greater emphasis was placed on the autonomy of individuals than on the reliance on the principle of best practice as set out in the 2001 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The recent report from the Mental Health Commission is worrying and highlights major deficits within mental health services, including issues of seclusion and physical restraint of young people.  Last year, 84 children and teenagers were admitted to adult units.  That is an appalling figure by any stretch of the imagination.  Last week, there was a debate at the Council of Europe on ending coercion in mental health services and the need for a human rights-based approach.  The Commissioner for Human Rights referred to how \"a coercion-based mental health system perpetuates the isolation of the very persons who need the support of their community the most, which in turn fuels more stigma and irrational fear\".  The report's rapporteur pointed to the fact that there was \"not enough scientific evidence to prove the usefulness of coercion in reducing harm, whereas there [was] abundant evidence for the harm &ndash; and sometimes irreparable harm &ndash; that involuntary placement and treatment can cause for patients\".  We need to reduce the stigma around and barriers to the provision of mental healthcare so that persons are empowered to seek and participate fully in treatment as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Staffing levels remain a serious concern.  Services in some parts of the country have fewer than half the recommended number of staff required for CAMHS as set out in A Vision for Change.  This is simply not good enough.

It is high time to accelerate recruitment and work towards full implementation of A Vision for Change because if we do not, the long-term consequence will be irreparable damage, as stated last week by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200054#BBB00500","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562101200,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Mental health remains the poor relation in the health service.  The health service overall is an omnishambles.  Cost overruns were estimated at approximately &euro;400 million based on current figures at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week at which the director general of the HSE appeared.  The Department of Health has always been starved of the resources it needs.  That is what leads to statistics such as being 2,671 staff short of what was envisaged in A Vision for Change, a policy that is now 13 years old.  We are not taking the issue of mental health seriously enough.  The 1916 Proclamation is made a mockery of in terms of the treatment of children.  Children are not treated equally.  Some are treated far more equally than others depending on whether there is cash in their parents' pockets or they have access to private care.  These Houses turn out report after report without any thought of implementation, costs or resources to ensure that we get the services we need.<\/p>  <p>  There are only three or four hospital-based child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, units, with none in the north west.  We do not have 24-7 CAMHS care, which is unacceptable.  The annual report of the Mental Health Commission highlighted that 40% of approved centres were not compliant with regulation 15, which relates to individual care plans.  That is shocking in the extreme.  Of the 27 centres that continued to use seclusion in 2018, 67% were non-compliant with the rules, while of the 52 approved centres that used physical restraint during the year, just 19% were compliant.<\/p>  <p>  It is a damning indictment of all Members of this House that in each debate on mental health we bemoan the fact that we are failing miserably all people with mental health needs, particularly children.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who is present, to be honest with the House and tell us how badly he, his colleagues and officials are being treated in terms of the provision of adequate resources to put the correct governance in place, get an adequate number of staff and attract them from abroad if necessary, although I cannot imagine why we would have a problem recruiting and training our own staff, and ensure that we move to 24-7 CAMHS services as a matter of the utmost urgency along with the provision of a full-time unit in the north west, similar to those located elsewhere in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200055#CCC00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1562101200,"counter":619,"content":"<p>More than two and a half times as many people die from suicide in this country as die in road accidents.  Many of them are young people whose lives are taken away and whose families are devastated as a consequence.  It is a national crisis.  As my colleague, Deputy MacSharry, stated, continuing care, especially in the area of mental health, tends to be the Cinderella of services.  However, it is of significant importance.  For some reason, it does not seem to get attention in terms of getting the same amount of finance as other health services or, for example, that has been invested in reducing the horror of car accidents.<\/p>  <p>  Members encounter this issue most often day to day in their clinics, where they are visited by people who are queueing to get into CAMHS.  No matter how acute the case may be, the CAMHS list is taken in sequence.  One gets on the list and one waits because it only has a fraction of the staff it needs.  The reality is that in some parts of the country there are only half the number of staff required to provide the service.  We do not seem to be able to understand that this is important and urgent and that the lack of staff is causing ongoing problems.  Many people with an intellectual disability also suffer from mental health issues.  People suffering from these disabilities and their parents must deal with that horrendous combination.  Again, there are not sufficient staff to treat them.  People are told that they must wait.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that a stitch in time saves nine.  It is far better to treat people as outpatients than inpatients.  Obviously, inpatient care is needed, but it should be the last resort.  We must question whether we have been penny wise and pound foolish in not ensuring adequate first-call services in CAMHS and other services to try to reduce the number of people who need a full-time residential service.  Those who need such a service should get top-class provision.  We need to get away from the Victorian ideas and conditions that bedevilled mental health services in the past.  Of course, putting an underage person into an adult service should be taboo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200055#CCC00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1562101200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne for tabling the motion, bringing this issue to the House and giving us an opportunity to discuss and debate it.  I thank him for his continued interest, as acknowledged by all of his colleagues present, his professionalism, and the very constructive spirit of co-operation in which he has always approached the issue of mental health.  It has been welcomed on this side of the House.  I thank all those who spoke on the motion.  I always find that debates on mental health issues are non-partisan because people's genuine passions come to the fore and, for the most part, they leave politics at the door, notwithstanding the responsibility of Opposition Deputies to hold the Government to account.<\/p>  <p>  I confirm that the Mental Health Act 2001 went to the Mental Health Commission.  That is a very welcome step which is long overdue.  The Act finally made that journey, which is a step in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  Many speakers referred to capacity, beds and issues arising in that regard.  Obviously, we will not tolerate governance issues, which are unacceptable.  Deputy Rabbitte's comments could have been a template for my closing speech.  I could not agree more with everything she said, and she said it very well.  We can look at capacity.  There is nothing more heartbreaking than to see a parent admitting his or her child to a CAMHS unit.  It is devastating to witness and we should try to avoid parents having to do so.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v noted towards the end of his contribution that such admissions are to be avoided at all costs.  As he stated, it is far preferable to treat people as outpatients than as inpatients.  All Members agree on that.<\/p>  <p>  We want to move to a more proactive space.  Thankfully, that is happening in the area of young people.  Last year, we introduced 114 assistant psychologists managed by 20 psychologists and overseen by ten advanced nurse practitioners.  That addition to the primary care service for young people was aimed to build infrastructure at a lower level to help prevent people having to go to CAMHS.  I could have decided to carry out an initiative aimed at reducing CAMHS waiting lists and throw a couple of million euro and additional resources at it, but I pulled back and decided to be more proactive and try to get to people earlier and to get intervention working at a lower level.  That is why we introduced those staff.<\/p><p>That is working well and capturing many of these issues earlier.  Like any initiative in health worth its salt, it will take time to show real tangible results.  Despite this, it has been independently evaluated already by the University of Limerick and it is showing significant decreases in waiting times for primary care psychology services for young people.  Of course that will have a knock-on impact on the child and adolescent mental health service list.  That is to be welcomed.<br\/><br\/>In the coming weeks we will have a &euro;3 million community fund.  It is a small fund initially but it is the first time we have taken some money away from the HSE on the basis that we want to support some of the wonderful initiatives in place in the community.  I will be launching the fund this side of September.  I hope that &euro;3 million will grow next year to &euro;5 million and then &euro;10 million.  Ultimately, that is a sea change and a move away from the more reactive spending of the HSE towards trying to deal with issues more proactively and recognising the work of community groups.  We need to support these groups if they demonstrate their work is proactive and preventative in nature.  That &euro;3 million will begin in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>One of the most significant tranches of work we have done in the Department in recent times is the refresh of A Vision for Change.  We consulted extensively and widely.  It is the single most important job because it will determine the policy long after I am in this position and regardless of whoever occupies this chair afterwards.  All of us as stakeholders and vested interests will determine the policy.  That will go to Cabinet in September.  It will be published subsequently.  It will set a new direction for us and will be far more outcome focused than the previous version.  A Vision for Change served many good purposes but was of its time, some 13 years ago.  It needs to be refreshed in recognition of changes and whatever.  In particular it needs to be more outcome focused rather than prescriptive like its predecessor, perhaps.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to capacity and the opening of the hospital in Portrane.  There is much talk of the children&rsquo;s hospital.  There is much negative commentary, and rightly so, as well as much concern around it.  Despite this, under the radar the new forensic central mental hospital that we are building is coming.  It is a &euro;170 million project.  It is on budget and on time.  It is being delivered by the HSE to the credit of those involved.  Often those in the HSE do not get credit for what they do right when they do it.  We will be getting the keys to that in September or October of this year and it will be open next year.  There will be additional capacity of approximately 70 beds there, which is a significant contribution to the overall service.<br\/><br\/>We had 20,000 acute psychiatric beds in the country in the 1960s.  Deputy Healy talked about his parents and their time.  It was probably before the 1960s when they were psychiatric nurses.  I often wondered about his interest in this area, and his background answered that question.  Today there are 1,000 inpatient psychiatric beds.  We have come a long way.  We do not want to let the stick back into that, as it were.  We want to avoid that at all costs.  That is why we have to put a focus on this work.  That will come under the refresh of A Vision for Change.  We have day hospitals to allow people to live in their homes at night but to go into day hospitals to receive the necessary treatment.  This treatment does not need to be part of a stay-over service.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about online services and I was delighted to hear her say it.  Today I was in Sligo.  Deputy MacSharry is gone now but I was there with my colleague, Deputy McLoughlin.  I looked at an online pain clinic.  The consultants in the pain clinic in Sligo University Hospital are reaching out to their patients online.  Patients do not have to trek into hospital to meet the staff.  They do not have to queue up, wait for hours or travel for hours.  They can literally pick up their handheld devices and speak to the consultants about managing their pain and prescriptions.  If they need a procedure, then obviously they have to come in for it, but the initial assessment is done online.  That is very positive and interesting.  We have several pilots running in the mental health area as well as psychology and psychiatry.  Where there are waiting lists, we are writing to people to ask whether they would like to avail of online psychiatry.  I have always said that mental health is an obvious service that can be delivered online.  I am delighted that Deputy Rabbitte recognises this.  This has been done in Australia and it is the future for us.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken about signposting.  I was two years in the job last week.  I have spoken about how we have 1,027 services funded by the HSE throughout the country.  It is difficult to know the most appropriate service or where to go.  People are clamming up, as it were, and joining the wrong queues, and there are long queues too.  If people were signposted more effectively and appropriately, we would avoid much of the queueing system.  The website <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>is up and running.  I appeal to all Deputies to promote it.  It is an exceptional website run by the HSE.  All a person has to do is put in his or her geography and issue and the website will tell the person the list of services available, whether in person, online, digital or whatever technologies are in place to support it.  That is in place.<br\/><br\/>I am going out to the National Ambulance Service tomorrow morning.  A telephone line is to be established.  I aim to have it up and running for World Mental Health Day.  The line is a one-stop telephone number and it is as recognisable as 999.  People can phone in and talk about their issues.  An appropriately trained person will be at the other end and will refer the person to the proper service and tell him or her where to go.<br\/><br\/>Approximately 600 calls per month coming into the National Ambulance Service are mental health related.  The service cannot do anything with them.  The staff do not know what to do with them.  They send out ambulances in many of these cases because that is all they can do, but that is not appropriate.  These calls will be captured under this telephone line.  Callers will have an appropriate person trained in mental health who will advise them on the service most appropriate for them, explain where it exists geographically and give the details.  We have several pilots in psychology and psychiatry.<br\/><br\/>The substance of the motion relates to the Mental Health Commission.  I acknowledge the work done by the commission.  I find the body highly constructive.  I heard Deputy Noonan speak about the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council one time.  He said there is no point in having a dog if it does not bark, as he said in his own inimitable way.  It is the same with the Mental Health Commission.  We fund it to the tune of &euro;14 million to enable it to challenge the services.  I welcome every challenge the commission puts our way.  Of course we have to work harder and better for our most vulnerable citizens, some of whom are detained in some of our facilities.  They need to have their rights protected.  The Mental Health Commission is on their side and we have to support its work and continually challenge the HSE, which is responsible for the delivery of those services.  It is not acceptable in any way shape or form that individual care plans are not available for each person or that they are dirty, untidy, unkempt or smelly.  That is deplorable and not acceptable on any level whatsoever.  I commend the work of the Mental Health Commission.  I assure all parties and none in the House that I will continue to support the very important and good work done by the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200055#CCC00400","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562101800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive outline.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Browne, on the work he has done to date.<\/p>  <p>  The recent report, regardless of what we have heard, highlights many areas of concern.  Some of the failures make for stark reading.  There is an ongoing crisis in mental health services for children.  As the Minister of State is well aware, early intervention for children with mental health issues is critical.  Too many children continue to be admitted to adult units.  One is one too many.  They are already vulnerable or scared and it is far from ideal and potentially more damaging to them to be admitted to an adult unit.<\/p>  <p>  The report states clearly that the first introduction of a child or adolescent to mental healthcare should not be through a service or building that is not specifically equipped to deal with his or her needs.  Last year, 84 children and teenagers were admitted to adult units.  I have dealt with many cases myself in my constituency of Waterford.  One teenager was in a hospital bed miles from home for months on end waiting for placement.  Another teenager was admitted to an adult ward and that really proved to be a barrier to his recovery.  I find that not only are the children and young teenagers affected, but there is a knock-on effect on the family, including the parents, grandparents and siblings.  It would be remiss of me to stand here tonight and not acknowledge the help I have received from the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in securing the correct facilities for both young teenagers whose cases I have mentioned.  I thank the Minister of State for that and for the help that he engaged in both cases.  This is the nub of the issue.  We can talk about it all night long.  There are not enough adolescent beds in the system in the State for these young people.  It is very difficult to have to place someone in a mental health institute that is no longer fit for purpose and that is for adults.<\/p>  <p>  The waiting lists and waiting times are too long.  I am calling for a renewed focus to reduce these service deficits.  I welcome what the Minister of State has said about the new 170-bed hospital at Portrane.  I am sure that will make a difference.  If there is one thing that we can take from tonight it is that we will do our level best.  I know the Minister of State has no wish to put a child into an adult facility.  He has told me as much and I believe him.  We need to get the message across to the Department and the HSE loud and clear that we will have zero tolerance when it comes to putting a young child into an adult facility.  If that is all that comes out of this debate tonight, then it will have been a job well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200056#DDD00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1562101800,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues for giving us the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  Child and adolescent mental health services as an issue have been raised several times.<\/p><p>According to A Vision for Change, the number of staff needed for CAMHS in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 area, which is my area, is 108, and at the moment we are 40 people short.  That is creating its own difficulties, and while circumstances have improved over the past number of months, it is still an issue.  The Minister of State will be familiar with St. Cecelia's school in Sligo, where there are issues as well.  A number of young children and young adults need speech and language therapy.  Unfortunately, a member of staff is about to go on maternity leave and the school is finding it difficult to get a replacement.  Can something be done to encourage people into that type of work?  At the moment, people are not available, and that is causing serious problems.  If those young children do not get an opportunity to speak with the help of a professional, they will have no chance as they become young adults.<\/p> <p> I welcome the new 27-bed unit in progress at Sligo University Hospital.  The Minister of State was there today, and I am sorry I could not be, but I had to be here.  A commitment for that unit was given to then Minister, Jimmy Devins, and me ten years ago, and I am glad it is progressing.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Butler said, no mother or father wants to have to bring an 18 year old child into a mental institution.  I once went with a set of parents when they did it, so I know what it is like and what the parents went through at that particular time.  It is devastating, both for them and for the person going into the institution.<\/p> <p> Another issue relates to parents of children with severe disabilities such as autism and other types of disabilities.  These are young adults aged 18, and they need to be placed somewhere because their parents, who are sometimes elderly, are not in a position to care for them.  They are not physically able to do it.  I am dealing with a number of cases at the moment in my area.  I acknowledge that there is a finance issue, and that it is expensive, but some of those parents are in danger.  They are not physically able, because these young adults are physically strong and need to be looked after.  I wonder if the Minister of State might examine that.  Having spoken to the HSE representatives in that area, I know that it is difficult, and that the money for the HSE CHO 1 area for 2019 has been spent already, but he might examine that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200056#DDD00300","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562102400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and all the contributors to the motion.  It arose out of the reports of both the Mental Health Commission and the Inspector of Mental Health Services, which highlighted some of the progress that has been made in mental health, but also many of the deficiencies and unacceptable situations in facilities for people with mental health issues.  I thank the Mental Health Commission and Mental Health Reform for their excellent work on mental health over a consistent period.  I also acknowledge the important work they do in highlighting issues relating to mental health services to ensure that what we are doing, or are trying to do, will be beneficial to people suffering from mental health issues.  Mental health staff acknowledge that they are under significant pressure and that their own mental health can also suffer when there is a serious shortage of staff.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the families and service users who this is all about.  I speak to parents regularly, including today in Wexford, who are often dealing with difficult situations, perhaps with their children but sometimes with their parents or other family members.  They find it distressing, frustrating, and at times devastating to have to deal with these situations every day.  They also experience frustration in trying to access the services they need for their children, who find it difficult to understand or comprehend the situations they find themselves in.<\/p>  <p>  Rates of self-harm are on the increase.  That is not the Government's fault.  It is a reflection of modern society, and of social media in particular, whether it is from body dysmorphia through Instagram, or bullying.  When I was young, if someone was being bullied, it stopped at the school gates or on the way home, but now bullying follows people all the way home, up the stairs, and into their bedrooms.  For many young people suffering from anxiety, depression, or bullying, sleep deprivation seems to be massive issue, because they are stuck on their iPads or phones.  It is hard for them not to do that, but social media is having a major impact.  It is a great experiment in some ways, because no generation before them has had to go through it.<\/p>  <p>  Suicide remains the biggest cause of death among young people aged 15 to 24, and prescription of antidepressants is on the increase.  I have no doubt it is being prescribed where necessary, but in the past year, &euro;400 million was spent on antidepressants while only &euro;10 million was spent on talk therapies.  The Minister of State is strong on early intervention, but that balance needs to be changed, so we can achieve earlier intervention as quickly as possible.  Everything escalates when the services are not there, and children then end up in emergency departments.  There has been a significant increase in the number of children attending emergency departments in my county as well.  We have to find a way to progress, because we all want the same thing.  I do not question the Minister of State's bona fides for one second.  He has worked hard in the Department to try to achieve the necessary changes in services, but I sometimes wonder whether mental health is given the seriousness and focus it needs within the higher echelons.  More and more money is being put into mental health services but we are not seeing the outcomes we need.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, and all the contributors to the debate.
