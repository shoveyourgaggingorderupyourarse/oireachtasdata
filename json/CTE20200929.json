The HSE winter plan, launched on 24 September, aims to ensure that our health service is prepared for these expected pressures while delivering services in the context of the continued presence of Covid-19.  It is increasingly evident that we can expect, and should therefore plan for, subsequent waves of Covid.<\/p> <p>  A community first approach to the delivery of care will be central to delivering safe, efficient and effective services through winter and beyond.  While service delivery will be reorientated towards general practice and primary care services, we are making substantial investment in our community and acute services, including additional home support and enhanced home support packages, community healthcare networks and community specialist teams, GP diagnostics, community based rehabilitation and step-down beds, and acute bed capacity.<\/p><p>By implementing this plan, we aim to support people to receive care at home or close to home, particularly older people and those with chronic diseases, and to enhance patient flow and patient experience in our acute hospitals. <br\/><br\/>Public health expertise is centrally important in leading the flu vaccination programme, advising on infection prevention and control in acute and residential settings and, crucially, in the identification, management and suppression of outbreaks.  The first deliveries of influenza vaccines to GPs, pharmacists and nursing homes started on 17 September.  All shipments are expected to be delivered before the end of October.  We secured sufficient doses to vaccinate all of the at-risk groups.  This winter, the vaccine will be offered to children aged between two and 12 years, delivered as a nasal spray, and will be available from GPs and pharmacists from this week. <br\/><br\/>A difficult winter season, coupled with a resurgence in Covid, is the worst possible scenario for our health services.  While this is an eventuality that we hope to avoid, it is also a scenario for which we have been carefully planning.  The HSE board and I acknowledge that the Government has committed significant resources to our winter plan to support us in managing the extremely challenging period ahead.  The winter plan and our testing and tracing model endorsed by the HSE board on 25 September are two major components of our overall pandemic plan for the health services.  Funding of the pandemic plan will be considered by Government as part of the Estimates process. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On testing and tracing, it is important to emphasise that we are meeting all testing demand.  We will continue to modulate all aspects of our response to Covid and to size our testing and tracing operation appropriately, relative to that demand.  Ireland is one of a few countries which automatically test close contacts and we conduct serial testing.  We are among the highest ranked in Europe on testing per 1 million of population, having done more testing than Germany, France, Norway, Italy, etc. <br\/><br\/>In terms of surge, we have increased our domestic laboratory capacity from about 70,000 samples per week to over 100,000 per week.  We are also fortunate to have additional surge capacity of 2,000 per day provided by our German laboratory partner.  In order to speed up test notification periods we are also looking at additional equipment, robots and process methodologies to increase our domestic testing capacity and turnaround.  To date, we have completed well over 1.12 million tests and last week we recorded 87,940 tests.  Our highest weekly test figure has been 90,000.  Last week, we completed over 15,381 contact tracing calls, our highest number to date.  The median end-to-end turnaround time in community settings over the past seven days is two days and 90% of people tested in the community received their result within this timeframe. <br\/><br\/>For community tests we have a median of 1.2 days from swab taken to laboratory result communicated.  We continue to improve turnaround times using IT-enabled processes and increased staffing and swabbing capacity.  Transition to a more permanent model for testing and tracing is under way.  Recruitment is ongoing, as is engagement with our stakeholders.  We are also looking at better system automation and integration.  It is important to re-emphasise that although testing and tracing is a key tool to protect against transmission of the virus, the primary line of defence is the public health measures that we must all take, all of the time.  Admissions to hospital are definitely rising, with 108 patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 - the figure is 114 this morning - and there are 17 confirmed cases in ICU.  The age profile of patients that has characterised the resurgence in the disease has been lower, but that will change unless community transmission is controlled. <br\/><br\/>Finally, even with a vaccine, the reality is that we will be dealing with Covid for a long time yet.  We must all adapt the way we live our lives through a combination of behavioural, societal and healthcare delivery changes.  The HSE needs a functioning society and economy in order to thrive.  Healthcare staff also know this and they continue each day to rise to the challenge.  The response of our staff to Covid-19 has been truly extraordinary and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.  It is crucially important that we continue to support them in the months ahead.  The best way to do that is to commit, every day, to supporting and following public health advice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid.

I am looking at the Be On call for Ireland pool.  I have been contacted by a number of organisations, including Diabetes Ireland, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Dental Association.  They have spoken about very specialist staff, namely specialist nurses, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, who are seconded, I imagine for the right reasons, to testing, but they need to go back into doing their jobs as well.<\/p> <p>  The number of people currently in the Be On Call for Ireland pool who can be hired is 1,600 in total.  A total of 68 medical laboratory aides have not been offered any work at all.  In fact, there were 98 originally when they first responded and approximately 30 dropped out.  The pool also includes 78 occupational therapists and 27 medical scientists.  There are staff, therefore, who could have been employed through that pool, yet they have not been.  When the HSE is recruiting, is the Be On Call for Ireland pool being used to fast-track appointments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#G01400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1601334000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>On targets, we do currently have targets, which are published on the website, including the mean end-to-end turnaround time and the 90% target for three days.

I will focus on schools.  As a society, we have prioritised getting schools back and all the way through the roadmap, one can see the priority is keeping schools open for the obvious psycho-social and educational benefits for children of attending school.  Testing and tracing in my area has not been fast enough in respect of schools.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a couple of specific issues to highlight them for the witnesses in case they are not already there, though I have also raised them via parliamentary questions.  For example, a schoolteacher in my area who was a suspected Covid contact over a weekend waited up to five days.  The impact of that as an individual is one thing, but there is also an impact on her school.  It was in the second week of September with the children trying to come back to school and develop relationships with that teacher, which is significant.  It is also significant for the school and school management.  I do not believe it is an isolated incident or that the five-day wait is absolutely unique.  In the course of prioritising testing, clearly the acute setting is prioritised and there is serial testing in a number of settings, but we have prioritised schools and it is very important to make sure that teachers have availability to test quickly.  I ask the witnesses to prioritise that further than has been done.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to raise a concern related to tracing.  A child tested positive in a school in my area.  My understanding from the school is that they were clearly told by NPHET and the HSE to leave the tracing process to the HSE.  They would be the people who would take charge of it and deliver it.  That was the school's and the principal's understanding.  However, in this case, there was no contact with the school from the HSE.  The parent rang the principal to inform him of the positive test and, but for this, the rest of the child's pod would have come back into school the following day.  The school is very distressed about the way in which it had to manage that and concerned about what else is happening.  But for that parent contacting the school rather than relying on the HSE to do so, there could have been a much broader problem.<\/p> <p>  It has been raised with me that there is an inconsistency in the response received by schools.  There may be a good reason for this, but, in some cases, it is advised that the pod should stay home while in others the whole class should stay home.  That may depend on the size of the school or certain technical issues but from the perspective of schools, they are seeing inconsistencies and it is making it difficult for them to plan and manage.<\/p> <p>  It has also been raised with me by two schools in my area that the HSE spreadsheet, which has been sent to schools to input the information is extremely difficult to use at a most basic level, where there is not even an appropriate data input in the Excel spreadsheet for phone numbers, for example.  That has been raised independently by two schools in two different parts of my constituency.  It is clearly a problem.  <\/p> <p>  I have raised all these points in one go, which takes most of my time, to get the witnesses' sense of the issues.  In particular, what is the situation regarding prioritising schoolteachers for getting tests, recognising the impact on school management, classes and children?  What is the position on tracing where there is a positive test in a school?  Is it up to the school or the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#H00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1601334000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I accept the legitimacy of what she says and the experience and feedback she has received.<\/p> <p>  I will speak to the overall experience with the data.  We have worked very closely with schools and principals and 90% of the test results are back within 24 hours and communicated to the schools.  In terms of schools looking for absolute consistency between how a pod or a classroom is treated, our public health doctors have clear processes to do this on a risk-based approach.  They assess each scenario on its own merits, and that is absolutely the way it has to be.  In terms of serial testing, they look at a range of scenarios and work with principals in schools in terms of giving advice back. <\/p> <p>  I will give the Deputy some figures.  In the first week that schools were back, 17% of the total testing that week was conducted on children in the zero to ten age group.<\/p><p>In the second week, it was up to 36%.

It did drop back to 0.5% and it is about 1.9% now.  We are watching that very closely.  On the tracing process, it is the responsibility of the HSE and of our public health teams working with contact tracing teams in terms of follow-through.  In terms of the overall experience and what has happened so far with schools, we have had total cases, like the index cases, of around 180 children.  Another 84 of them were identified following on from those index cases.  There were 11 outbreaks across the country and 4,328 children and some teachers were tested over the last few weeks.  We are putting a huge focus on it, which, positively, is keeping our children back at school and keeping schools open, which is exactly what we want to do.

It is a really prominent point to make.

That is a cause of concern for us in the HSE.  It is probably the reason that I am always very strong and clear in saying, from a HSE health perspective lockdowns or severe restrictions are bad for the health service.

We have learned that lockdown caused secondary harm not just to older people, as has been mentioned, or mental health but also due to later presentation of disease. People did not present to screening programmes and to early cancer diagnostic programmes.  We are also aware of the impact on child health.  A very useful study performed in conjunction with the faculty of paediatrics showed that the lockdown caused harm not just to children's education but also to their health and well-being.  Education is an important health medium for children because the immunisation programmes are carried out there and also screening.  In addition, up to one fifth of referrals to Tusla are from schools.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned, so what we are doing now is reopening services as well as trying to keep the virus suppressed, which is a considerably more difficult task than we faced in April when we, as it were, wiped the slate clean just to suppress the virus alone.  We realise, not just from the position in Ireland but also from international experience, that there is later presentation of some serious illness, such as cancer, and we also appreciate the danger of diagnostic tunnel vision - that in focusing on testing for Covid-19 alone we might ignore other, potentially more serious, infectious disease.  Hence, from the beginning of March we have worked very closely with practitioners in primary care in making sure that when they are screening people for Covid testing they also, as guardians of the nation's health, screen people for other important disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#K00500","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I have a brief follow-up question for Dr. Cuddihy.

It can be significant because what happens is one starts to get some of our wards frozen and having to be isolated.  That has been the case in some instances in Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. James's Hospital and in other hospitals around the country.  A small number of cases can have a significant impact.  The big differece is right now we are aiming to restore all of our services and bring back as much elective cases as we possibly can and all of our services that we spoke about earlier, whereas in the March-April period we had ceased all of our other services.  We are running a dual system in all our services, both in our acute system and in our community system, a system where we are trying to protect against Covid and at the same raise up all of our other services to a level that we need them to be.  That is the challenge for us right now, today.<\/p> <p>  Significantly, if the virus continues in this upward trend, as in March-April, then I would make a few comments.

Is that for all testing and tracing or does he have a figure that relates to community cases only?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the overall cost of testing and tracing.  Mr. Reid said to us here back in June that the estimated cost was approximately &euro;450 million on the basis of testing 15,000 per day.  Thankfully, we did not have to do that for the summer months.  In recent times the HSE has been gearing up for 15,000 per day.  What is the current estimated annual cost for the full testing and tracing system, bearing in mind that lull period during the summer?<\/p> <p>  My third question concerns tracing.  Many of us were surprised and concerned when we learned within the past two weeks that the tracing element of the service only goes back 48 hours and, because of that, we do not really have a handle on the places of transmission of the virus.  I read in recent days that the intention is that the HSE will start going back four, five or six days to establish where a person has picked up the virus.

Regarding WHO and ECDC guidelines, the priority is most definitely speed in making contact with close contacts.  It has been proven across all testing and tracing systems that that is a priority.  However, I wish to reassure the committee that our public health teams have done a phenomenal job relentlessly throughout the whole year.<\/p><p>Our public health teams look back further, and have knowledge beyond the contacts of cases and from the individual conversations they have with people.  They have knowledge across their databases of a range of experiences of a number of people, and so have much more retrospective knowledge.

They look back beyond the 48-hour contact window for our contact tracing teams as they have data that go much further back than that.  <\/p><p>However, that said, I wish to make two extra points.  In response to the Deputy's last question, we are willing to and intend to look at and assess what further way one could go back and engage in what is called enhanced retrospective tracing.

We have approval for 158 extra resources to go into these public health teams and they will not be for contact tracing.

An extra 30 beds were funded by Government and further beds were put in place with the pandemic funding.  This brought the number up to 280 today, an increase of about 25% since February.  Separately, we have funding for an extra 17 beds in the winter plan.  That will bring us close to 300, which would be about a 30% increase on our February figure.<\/p> <p>  On the 334 figure the Deputy mentioned, he is correct.  During the early phase of this, our ICU consultants did a fantastic job when all our hospital services were closed.  They created a surge capacity, if we had needed it, of well over 300 beds, as the Deputy said.  That was the capacity that was utilised for the surge.  We trained 2,000 nurses and doctors to manage the surge capacity.  Obviously, we have those high-dependency unit beds, pre-operative and post-operative theatre beds back in service now, bringing us to our fully manned number, which the Deputy quite rightly said is 280 today.

I have used the word \"frustration\" a number of times at meetings of this committee.  I am deeply frustrated today, and I will state why.  Doctors differ and patients die.  We are talking about tracing and so on when testing is the key.  Rapid turnaround testing would do an awful lot to prevent a surge of Covid.  I brought antigen tests to NPHET almost eight weeks ago and nothing has been done with them.  On television last night, we saw the US President, Mr. Donald Trump, announcing a plan for 150 million antigen tests.  There were another 15 million from a company about which I informed NPHET.  NPHET has decided to look away from antigen tests.<\/p> <p>  We saw this morning that Vienna is considering LAMP technology, which Professor Tom&aacute;s Ryan brought to this committee six weeks ago.  It has not been pursued.  I am referring to rapid turnaround tests that are far cheaper than what we are using.  They would give us scope to chase down contacts at a very early stage and to begin testing for asymptomatic cases &ndash; random testing &ndash; in the HSE environment and in community care to ensure workers are not transmitting disease.  We cannot seem to go forward.  Dr. Henry has answered this question before and has spoken about specificity and the positivity rate of polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing by comparison with other methods, but the tests to which I am referring are approved by the WHO.  Why in the name of God are we not trying to pursue these testing applications?

They are fantastic.  We have beaten this virus once and if we all follow the rules, we will beat it again.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions, one of which is about County Louth.  I want to stress that it just so happens that there is a higher incidence of the virus in the north of the county at the moment than in the south.  Therefore, the question of closing down the whole county is one of concern.  This could apply in the context of any county.  Can the HSE look at areas smaller than county areas if it is necessary to move to level 3?   I understand that nobody wants to go there or to recommended it, least of all the HSE.  Can the executive look at smaller populations other than those of entire counties?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the positivity index or number.  Yesterday, this stood at 2.9%.  I have been reading and I am contrasting what is happening.  I understand that the positivity number is actually going up.  If one looks at what is happening in New York, the number stands at 1.58%.  The Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, was quoted as saying that if it goes above 2.8% today, it would make him nervous.  At 3% or above on a seven-day rolling average in the state of New York, he will automatically shut down all the schools.

However, the real way we will beat this virus is in the community.  Every individual action we all take will make a huge difference.  It made a difference last time and we are calling on the public to make the difference again this time.<\/p> <p>  Second, on looking at the smaller areas, I am not trying to be short with the Deputy but, ultimately, that is a decision on an evaluation made by NPHET and not directly by the HSE.

It is hard to distinguish but, ultimately, that is just a personal view.<\/p> <p>  On the positivity rate, the Deputy is correct.  It is increasing and it is a cause for concern for us, particularly as one can track it into certain parts of the community where it is increasing.  From a public health perspective, the R-nought number, which the Deputy will be familiar with, is one that is tracked globally and that has increased.  As Professor Philip Nolan said recently, it is somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7 so, in essence, if it is at 1.5, then every ten people infected are infecting another 15 others.

It is not just the positivity rate but the pressures on hospitals.  What we are trying to do by suppressing the curve is to not just prevent illness and death but also to avoid the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed.  We know that the natural history of this virus is to transmit freely in a much more contagious way than influenza and overwhelm healthcare systems when unchecked.  On the Deputy's point about the 3%, the particular risk with community transmission is that when it gets to a very high, unmitigated level, the most robust defences in nursing homes or hospitals will not withstand that level of community transmission because of the multiple potential points of entry into a residential facility or hospital.  On schools, we know from the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, guidance of 8 August which was based on evidence largely from Denmark and other countries that schools represent little threat to the community.  It is the other way around, high levels of community transmission - in this case one measure might be the positivity rate of testing - represent a greater risk to schools remaining open than schools being open represents to the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Dowd and call Deputy McAuliffe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#W00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I will ask my two questions and give the HSE as much time as possible to answer.  I think that earlier Mr. Reid was prevented from putting this on the record but all my questions are in the context of a line included in his opening submission, namely that Ireland has done more testing <i>per capita<\/i>than France, Germany, Norway and Italy.  I want to commend the HSE on the work it is doing.  I am not sure that there is a realisation in the public mindset of the level of testing which has actually taken place in Ireland, and the success we have had in ramping it up.<\/p><p>I represent a part of Dublin, the Ballymun-Finglas ward, which has had 165 cases per 100,000 over the past 14 days.  It is of huge concern locally and there is not really an understanding of whether that is because of known clusters in institutions or particular communities or if it is a wider issue in the community.  The community transmission rate of 25% in the area points to an issue.  Could the HSE perhaps come back to me on that case because locally public representatives want to do more to try to encourage people to take all of the steps needed.  Will the HSE consider doing a walk-in testing centre in that electoral area in order to improve access to testing?  We do have an issue with GP access in the area and I will put my plug in for the primary care centre, as I am speaking.<\/p><p>I also have a concern around travel and testing.

I will, if I may, make a point just to reassure the public.  I have never advocated that we have the absolute optimum testing and tracing system.  We need to build and evolve what we have and that is a discussion we have had with our board about building a future model and that is what we are doing as part of our plans.  The facts are that, including just up to yesterday, some world data reports that we rank among some of the highest countries per 1,000 head of population.

I have four questions to which I would like an answer, the first of which is directed to Mr. Reid.  Over the past number of Covid committee meetings, I have called for the recruitment of a dedicated workforce for testing and tracing.  I was recently contacted in my office by a person who had been told by the HSE that it was not recruiting.  Will the HSE be recruiting, in particular to address the language barriers, which is an issue that has come across my desk several times in the past few weeks and, if so, what are the criteria in that regard?<\/p> <p>  We all heard today about the WHO's reference to a global test, which is cheaper and faster and can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes.  Does the HSE intend to secure these devices?  My understanding is that currently 97% of tests carried out here are negative.  Mr. Reid might confirm if that is the case.  In regard to cost, will there be a cost of between &euro;200 and &euro;275 for this new test?  My understanding is that this new test, which is referenced in today's newspapers and was mentioned on the radio this morning, is really good.  Is it proposed to use these tests?  <\/p> <p>  I have a number of concerns regarding communication.  We are all playing our part.  I compliment everybody on doing so.<\/p><p>We all have personal responsibility.  However, there is major confusion when a person rings for a test and is told that he or she and his or her family must isolate.  Do we have to be more specific that people must isolate for 14 days if they request a test?  In my area of Carlow I was dealing with one or two cases.  The paramedics are doing a great job, but they are on call-outs.  We have a testing centre in Tinryland which is by appointment only.  That is brilliant and I welcome it.  However, signage for testing centres in rural areas is a matter we must examine because there was some confusion about that during the week.  They are all doing an excellent job and I say \"well done\" to them.  I understand that when people call for paramedics to visit their homes, there is a backlog of four or five.  We must examine that.<\/p><p> We all probably got a fright when we saw today that, globally, over 1 million people have died with Covid-19.  We are approaching the winter months.  Everybody is trying to get the flu vaccine.  My mother is elderly and she has got the vaccine.  I realise we must prioritise, but we face many different challenges with the winter coming.  Among the issues we will face is lockdowns in certain areas.  Are we recruiting?  Tomorrow the committee will be discussing living with Covid, but I believe we have to do more.  There is still a little confusion about information and even control.  That is not for us in the committee, but a matter for the HSE.  Last night, there was a great deal of activity in Galway and it was a big issue this morning.  I understand it was freshers' week.  There are control issues we must examine.  We are approaching Hallowe'en, Christmas and big events in people's lives.  We have gone through communions and confirmations.  There must be a great deal more information and we must examine how we can control what is coming.<\/p><p> Perhaps Mr. Reid would respond on the dedicated workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#Y01300","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1601334000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I can confirm that we are recruiting a dedicated workforce across a range of aspects of testing and tracing.

My worry is that the trend is still going the wrong way.  I raised this issue last week, but the trend continues.  I am not suggesting that blame be apportioned anywhere, but there must be something from the information and research available to the HSE that would indicate where the worst situations are emerging.  My suspicion is that it is failure to observe social distancing, but in recent days I heard a reference to house parties and pubs.

The public wants predictability and, much of the time, we can only provide uncertainty but that is the reality of the virus, as I reflected on in my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Some of the comments that the Deputy made are true.  We need the public to work strongly with us.  Social distancing, reducing social gatherings and contacts make a huge impact.  The inverse is also true and increasing one's contacts increases the possibility of contracting the disease.  Increasing one's social gatherings increases the potential of the virus to spread.  Decreasing one's social distancing and gathering with others leaves one at a wide risk of contracting the virus.  From the perspective of the HSE, we need a strong call to arms to the public to work strongly with us in the coming days and weeks.  This can be turned around.  We know we can reduce the impact of the virus on our hospitals and community services but it really needs a galvanised public to hold arms with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020092900002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid for his reply.

This is our first meeting.  I welcome the members.  It is great to have the committee up and running and to be getting under way with work.  I particularly welcome members who are newly elected to the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  We have not received any apologies.<\/p> <p>  As we know too well, Ireland and the wider world have changed fundamentally since the previous committee was dissolved.  We have all been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and our lives altered in ways we could not have envisaged only a short time ago.

That has had a knock-on effect on getting the committees up and running.  I endeavour to be fair and impartial to all members and all witnesses.  I had the privilege of chairing the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in the last D&aacute;il for a period and I would like to think that people would have said I was very fair.

We are not having that procedure today but if members want to put forward nominations, they should email them to the clerk.  I suggest that we try to get that done at the next meeting as it is important to have a Vice Chairman, particularly in the current climate as we never know who might have to take some time off.  While it is important to get it done, I do not think it would be fair to throw it at people today.  Members are welcome to take the time to send in any nominations and then we will deal with the matter at our next meeting.  Is that agreed?

One of the problems we have is that, because of Covid, we have to have distance between attendees.  If all members turn up, this room will not suit us, so we have to think about that, not today but for our next meeting.  If we could get a different room, perhaps the Seanad Chamber or even the D&aacute;il Chamber, it would be more appropriate because this is such an important committee and we want to encourage all members to attend, but we will just see how that works out.  The protocol is that the clerk to the committee will be aware of what we are saying and we can follow it up.<\/p> <p>  A number of people could not make it today, and a number of members are chairing other committees.  The first item on the agenda is the election of a Vice Chairman.  Deputy Lawless is chairing the justice committee.  The clerk to the committee was not aware of the full membership of the committee until Friday evening.  I am in members' hands as to what to do.  It might be wiser to wait until next week to elect a Vice Chairman if people cannot be here because of the short notice.  We could put the election as the first item on the agenda for next Thursday.  The clerk to the committee has been working with the other secretariat staff and the proposal is that we meet, as we did previously, at 2 p.m on Thursdays.

Despite the important work of this committee, to which the Chairman rightly referred, Thursday afternoon here was very often like the <i>Mary Celeste<\/i>.  Groups invited to make presentations were being brought into a vacuous, empty LH 2000.  I am very conscious of how this looks to witnesses, but also to members.  It was deeply frustrating that meetings clashed with the voting block.  Where press coverage of this committee&rsquo;s work was concerned, information was going out on a Thursday night or Friday and not getting any kind of lift at all.

As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said, very few of us were here most Thursday evenings, unfortunately.  At times, this was embarrassing when deputations came from far and near.  Our meetings clashed with those of other committees.<\/p> <p>  In 2011 and 2012, I believe we were asked to sit on Thursday afternoons to facilitate Westminster MPs.  Quite a few of them were attending at that time.  There was a clash with other committee meetings early on Thursdays and, as Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said, the voting block tore the back out of it altogether.  Votes were going on for a long time, meaning our committee often started late.  That was also one of the problems.  I would like a time that would facilitate most members, but not a ludicrous time late in the evening when there would be no hope of getting any coverage or of a good attendance.  I would have no difficulty with a Monday or Friday, if that is the best option to facilitate all members as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020092900002#C00500","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1601334000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n coming in.

From speaking to former members, it has a reputation as being very a hard-working, productive and collegiate committee.  I hope and intend that we will continue in the same vein.  I know that is the intention of the members to whom I have spoken.  I only got to speak to the members who are Deputies and I apologise for not getting to the Senators.  The membership list came to me quite late in the week.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, housing is a massive issue and it will be a primary focus of the committee.  We will also cover heritage, water services, local government and planning.  As I said, it is a wide-ranging brief.  The Covid restrictions regarding distancing are going to impact on our work.  In fact, one of the items on the agenda today concerns the restrictions under which we will be operating.  We will just have to get used to them and accept there will be teething problems at the start.  I am sure we can all work together to come up with a formula and way of working that keeps us within the health guidelines but allows us to work productively.<\/p> <p>  As Chairman, I will be as fair and impartial as I can to all members of the committee and to witnesses who attend meetings and assist us in our work.
