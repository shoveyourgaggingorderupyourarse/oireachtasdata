Difficult discussions took place over four days, but the Government has welcomed this agreement. It is a fair and balanced outcome<b><\/b>and demonstrates that Europe can work collectively to deal with this once-in-a-generation crisis. Council conclusions set out the leaders&rsquo; agreement for the European Commission to borrow &euro;750 billion, supporting Member States with &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans. Agreement was also reached on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) from 2021 to 2027, totalling &euro;1.074 trillion, which will support rural and regional development, and the transformation of our economies\u00a0in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.<\/p><p>Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU Budget since 2014, and this position is set to grow further over the course of the next MFF. In May 2020, the European Commission produced a needs assessment underpinning the proposed Next Generation EU. In this needs assessment the European Commission estimated that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the Next Generation EU package would in the region of approximately &euro;18.7 billion over the next thirty years and estimated that Ireland would potentially receive a total of up to &euro;2 billion in grants, with a further &euro;1 billion in loans available up to 2024 should Ireland decide to borrow same. However, these estimates were overtaken by the European Council agreement of 21 July 2020. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the EU Budget are projected to increase considerably over the coming period in all scenarios as a result of economic growth in recent years.<b><\/b>Irish contributions to the EU budget are expected to rise over the coming MFF period from approximately &euro;3 billion in 2021, to approximately &euro;4 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.5 billion.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Exact contributions to the repayment of Next Generation EU borrowing are yet to be determined but are expected to be significant, and will depend significantly on what new own resources arrangements are agreed. It is not possible to give an accurate overall figure until we make a decision on new\u00a0own resources at EU level.\u00a0At this time of crisis, the Covid recovery funds are needed now, and will be received by Member States up to 2026, but will be paid back over 30+ years. These repayments are not expected to begin for a number of years yet, and the contribution Ireland will make will depend on our share of the overall EU budget over the course of those repayments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900065#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":14,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 41 and 42 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900066#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[26798\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900066#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a recent Central Bank report on household wealth; his views on the growth in the net wealth of the top 20% of households from &euro;560,000 to &euro;853,000; and if he will consider adjusting taxation measures to increase revenue from the top 10% quintile of households to help fund the Covid-19 recovery.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the recently published Central Bank report\u00a0&ldquo;Household Wealth: What is it, who has it, and why it matters&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  This report presents the results from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) 2018, which collects data on households&rsquo; financial positions.

The Central Bank report also highlights that a significant portion of wealth for most households was tied up in the family home, and that increases in house prices (74% increase for the period) was a major factor in the reported increase in household wealth.\u00a0 This net wealth grew across the entire wealth distribution, while inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell over the same period.

of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax liabilities that arise at year end. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has provided assurances \u00a0that individuals will be given the opportunity to opt to fully or partially pay any income tax liabilities that still arises following the allocation of unused credits and where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing tax credits over 4 years, interest free, to minimise any hardship.\u00a0 The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The week 1 basis of taxation means that where an employee returns to work or takes up a new employment following a period while in receipt of the PUP or the TWSS, an employee&rsquo;s tax is calculated on a &lsquo;non-cumulative basis&rsquo;. \u00a0In these cases, an employer will deduct income tax and USC from a person&rsquo;s pay on a week-to-week basis. \u00a0Yearly tax credits and rate bands are not backdated to the 1 January and do not accumulate for each pay period. \u00a0Employers are not permitted to make any refunds of income tax or USC that may be due until a &lsquo;cumulative&rsquo;

These statistics are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. As of 25 September 2020, over 36,746 employers had registered for the scheme and the published statistics include a breakdown of employers by size, sector and county. \u00a0EWSS registered employers must file payslips with Revenue for eligible employees in respect of relevant pay periods. Until these processes are completed it is not possible to know the number of employees (nor their characteristics or locations) that will be supported under the scheme. The payslip information for EWSS recipient employers for the period 1 September onwards will be available from October and Revenue has confirmed that it will publish employee level information as soon as is practicable after that date.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the number of employees earning less than &euro;151.50, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to predict in advance the number of employees likely to be paid at or below a certain income range in September 2020. Incomes in earlier months do not provide a reliable guide to possible September levels, given the volatility in the labour market this year as well as the usual seasonal changes observed month to month. Also, the Deputy will be aware that the substitution of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) subsidies for &lsquo;gross pay&rsquo; for a substantial number of employees across the economy this year, further complicates comparisons to previous months.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor closely the administration of the EWSS as well as the uptake and utilisation of this important economy-wide employment measure in the weeks and months ahead with a view to ensuring that it achieves its objective of supporting viable enterprises and employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900066#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[16653\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900066#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether it is appropriate that those businesses in high profitability sectors should be eligible for the temporary wage subsidy scheme;

In particular, lenders are obliged to\u00a0engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate alternative repayment arrangement\u00a0having regard to the particular circumstances of a case, and\u00a0lenders should\u00a0use the full suite of\u00a0solutions available to them for their borrowers who continue to be impacted by Covid-19. In this regard, it is important to note that, while the European Banking Authority recently stated\u00a0it would not extend its 30 September closing date to qualify for a Covid-19 payment break,\u00a0banks can continue to support their customers with an extended payment break after 30 September on a case by case basis if needed with such loans classified according to the normal prudential framework.<\/p>  <p>  I will also continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support following a Covid-19 payment break. In this regard, the Central Bank wrote to all regulated lenders\u00a0on 8th June setting out its expectations in relation to payment breaks. That\u00a0letter requested that firms confirm that they are adhering to the Bank&rsquo;s supervisory expectations and what the Bank expects in firms&rsquo; communications with borrowers. In addition, it requested that firms submit their Board approved strategic and operational plans for managing the increase in distressed debt, including supports for those borrowers unable to resume full payments after a payment break. The Central Bank has advised\u00a0that it has challenged the five retail banks and six retail credit firms\/credit servicing firms on their plans. While it is broadly satisfied with the firms&rsquo; plans, the Central Bank will continue to engage with all firms to ensure that these plans are effective.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the accrual of interest on loans, it should be noted that lenders will continue to incur costs (both in respect of funding and enhanced operational requirements) and that other borrowers\u00a0will continue to be liable for\u00a0their interest charges.\u00a0 However, apart for normal interest, no other specific charge or fee will be imposed on a borrower who avails of a Covid-19 payment break.\u00a0\u00a0Covid-19 payment break\u00a0measures do not come without cost to the banking sector and these costs will also have to be managed\u00a0in a way that protects their business and will be as fair as possible to the various stakeholders.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it has also been made clear to banks\u00a0that it will not be acceptable for them to make excess profits on payment breaks and that it will be a matter for them to demonstrate that such a situation will not arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900066#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Liability Insurance","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[24340\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"her plans to address the rising costs and limited access to public liability insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I am very much aware of the problems faced by many businesses, community groups and voluntary organisations in relation to the availability and affordability of public liability insurance.\u00a0 However, as this is a commercial matter for insurers neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover.\u00a0 This position is underpinned by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.\u00a0 The Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise so as to benefit consumers and businesses and work will advance on this matter through the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing the affordability and accessibility of public liability insurance, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the executive board of the Judicial Council shortly.

The reason for this approach is that the capital being transferred has not been earned by the beneficiary. In this context, \u00a0the effective taxation of windfall capital is an important tool for addressing income and wealth inequality, thus enabling\u00a0our tax code create a fairer society.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, there are already very generous rules in relation to inheritance tax on agricultural property. For instance, qualifying farmers can avail of agricultural relief, which reduces liability to CAT by 90%. The relief operates by reducing the market value of &lsquo;agricultural property&rsquo; (including farmland, buildings, stock) by 90%, so that inheritance tax is calculated on an amount, known as the &lsquo;agricultural value&rsquo;, which is substantially less than the market value.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for agricultural relief, 80% of the beneficiary&rsquo;s assets, after having received the gift or inheritance, must consist of qualifying agricultural assets. The beneficiary must also be an active farmer, or lease the land to one.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, another valuable CAT relief is the CAT Favourite Nephew or Niece relief. This relief allows a nephew or niece to be treated as a child for CAT purposes, subject to certain conditions. This means that they will be entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;335,000, instead of the Group B tax-free threshold of &euro;32,500, which would normally apply to this relationship. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of this relief is to target a nephew or niece who \u00a0has worked for their aunt or uncle over a 5-year period prior to inheritance for a minimum number of hours per week, putting their labour and expertise at the disposal of the aunt or uncle and making a sustained contribution to the business before inheritance.<\/p>  <p>  When combined with CAT Agricultural Relief, this relief is intended to support the intergenerational transfer of a family farm and is particularly important in circumstances where a farmer may not have a direct descendant (e.g. child) to whom they may bequeath the family farm.<\/p>  <p>  However, extending the Favourite Nephew or Niece relief to allow the nomination of a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; would clearly represent a fundamental departure from the principles underpinning our current CAT regime, as well as a significant departure from the policy rationale of the Favourite Nephew or Niece relief. Such a move would also lead to an erosion of the revenue base. For example, this could result in a beneficiary who does not have a family relationship with the disponer becoming entitled to the same tax-free threshold as a child of the disponer, currently &euro;335,000, instead of a tax-free threshold of &euro;16,250. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, this would most likely be followed by pressure to extend this to other reliefs, such as CAT business relief, or more broadly for disponers to seek to nominate a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; for their estate.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, there are currently no plans to extend the CAT Favourite Niece or Nephew Relief or to amend the operation of CAT Agricultural Relief to allow for the nomination of a Favourite Successor.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":57,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":58,"content":"<p>Question No. 55 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":59,"content":"<p>Question No. 56 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[26671\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects the economy to remain competitive in the short to medium-term notwithstanding the impact of Brexit and the Covid-19 virus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>Approaching the pandemic, Ireland was in a strong macroeconomic position, with robust economic growth in recent years and an improved fiscal position.

Recently the EBA announced that there would be no further extension to the guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  The guidelines were put in place to ensure banks could effectively manage the large volume of requests for payment breaks anticipated the beginning of the pandemic. Following the 30 September deadline, the pre COVID-19 standards will apply whereby banks consider requests from borrowers on a case by case basis.<\/p>  <p>  The expiry of the guidelines do not prevent banks from engaging with customers who continue to experience difficulty beyond the deadline and all applicable consumer protections remain in place.\u00a0 Borrowers who cannot return to full repayments following the conclusion of their payment break should engage with their lender as early as possible.

The Central Bank have reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) from 1% to 0% and they estimate this will free up about &euro;940 million of capital across the Irish retail banks to facilitate lending or help banks absorb losses. At an EU level, a number of support measures have already taken place. The European Central Bank announced that banks can temporarily operate below the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB).

Thereafter, a very gradual recovery commencing in the third quarter was assumed. <\/p>  <p>  As expected, the suspension of all &lsquo;non-essential&rsquo; economic activity during the second quarter of the year resulted in the Irish economy suffering the largest contraction on record, with a contraction in GDP of 6.1 per cent relative to the previous quarter.\u00a0 As a result, the level of GDP was three per cent lower year-on-year. However, modified domestic demand, perhaps the best indicator of domestic economic activity, declined by 15.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter indicating that the domestic economy took the brunt of the economic shock.<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, a partial recovery in GDP is expected for the third quarter.\u00a0 Retail sales in July were 4.7 per cent above the pre-pandemic (February) level with a range of ultra-high frequency indicators (e.g. payments data) pointing to a general stabilisation in August and September.

Taking all these factors into account, I do not feel an additional levy of the nature proposed by the Deputy would be appropriate at this time.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":106,"content":"<p>Question No. 73 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC04450"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[26718\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the review of the policy framework within which credit unions operate.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>The Government\u00a0welcomes the\u00a0important work credit unions are doing to support communities throughout Ireland at this\u00a0difficult time and\u00a0recognises the\u00a0key role that credit unions play\u00a0in the delivery of financial services in local communities across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of commitments set out in\u00a0Programme for Government, including a review of the policy framework in which credit unions operate.

For example, interest rates on fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.67% in July of this year. There have\u00a0also\u00a0been reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 4.26% from Q1 2015 to Q1 2020, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.13% to 7.08% on APRC consumer loans over the same period).<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless,\u00a0it should also be noted that Irish loans, particularly with respect to Irish mortgages, can have different characteristics from those offered by other EU banks making direct comparison of headline mortgage rates inconsistent. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Irish mortgages are also not subject to upfront fees typically charged by banks in other EU jurisdictions, and which can result in lower EU headline rates.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless,\u00a0there are a\u00a0number of important factors determine the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain\u00a0structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);<\/p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank\u00a0has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.\u00a0 The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter\u00a0for individual lenders.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central\u00a0Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other\u00a0competition in the mortgage market,\u00a0both for new and existing borrowers.\u00a0 It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the\u00a0market and it will be of benefit to\u00a0new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may\u00a0still on a standard variable rate with the lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900067#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":117,"content":"<p>Question No. 76 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Rebate Scheme","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900068#WRD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[25662\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900068#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered a restoration of the fuel rebate scheme to cover excise duty and carbon taxes for the coach operators whose services have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.","asker":"1545","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>If the Deputy is referring to the Diesel\u00a0Rebate\u00a0Scheme (DRS) for hauliers and bus operators, this scheme has been continuously in operation since 1 July 2013.

Revenue has advised me that compliance checks have been completed in respect of more than 23,000 employers to date representing almost 67% of employees that were supported by the scheme. The checks have confirmed high levels of compliance with the terms of the scheme by most employers. However, a relatively small number of cases have been identified as needing closer examination and these enquiries are ongoing. Where issues are identified, Revenue expands the examination to include the employer&rsquo;s overall tax situation.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding EWSS, Revenue has advised me that its current focus is to assist eligible employers with the registration process and to provide them with any support they might need in claiming their entitlements under the scheme.\u00a0 As of 25 September, some 36,746 employers have successfully registered for the scheme and the intention is that payments in respect of September will be made in mid-October.\u00a0 Revenue has also advised me that it has very recently made EWSS payments for July and August 2020 to almost 2,700 employers in respect of newly hired or seasonal staff that were not previously included in the TWSS. EWSS related compliance checks will start once the scheme is fully operational.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding publication of TWSS recipients, Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that the names and addresses of all employers to whom a subsidy payment was made will be published by Revenue. However, the names of\u00a0employers who registered for the TWSS but did not subsequently operate the scheme and did not receive any payments will not be published. Also, the\u00a0details of employers who may have unintentionally applied for and received payments, or who sought to leave the scheme for other legitimate commercial reasons, will not be published providing the amounts received are repaid and all associated tax and PRSI issues are fully addressed. Revenue has advised me that the list of employers that received TWSS payments will be published as soon as possible once these employer related adjustments are finalised.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the EWSS, section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that the names and addresses of all employers to whom a payment is made during the period July to December 2020, will be published by Revenue as soon as is practicable in January 2021.

The BPFI has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application ().<\/p><p>However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, or temporarily suspend a mortgage approval in principle, is a commercial and contractual decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard. Furthermore, a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown and, in such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p><p>The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of necessary, sufficient and proportionate information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances.

It is my full expectation this will be positive for Irish consumers. For example, amongst other things, the Act\u00a0obliges insurers to engage meaningfully with consumers when a claim has been submitted; places a limit on the amount of a claim settlement offer that an insurer can retain until repairs have been completed; and\u00a0restricts the circumstances in which insurers can repudiate the contract on materially unrelated grounds.<\/p>  <p>While the majority of the Act is now law, I have made the decision that sections 8, 9, 12, 14(1)-(5) will come into effect on the 1st   September 2021. It is important to note that significant systems changes are required by the industry before the related provisions could go live. Accordingly, the sections being commenced next year broadly relate to insurers' obligations to provide more detailed information when signing consumers up to a contract (Section 8), and providing greater consumer transparency about their\u00a0 claim and premium\u00a0history at renewal (Section 12). In turn, Section 9 and 14(1)-(5) are intrinsically linked to the information requirements set out in section 8 and therefore also require a longer commencement period. All of these significant new contract and renewal requirements will require insurers to upgrade their systems, which require time to implement because of the technical nature and scale of what will be required.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, I will consider the commencement of Section 18 when a specific technical legal point has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion my decision to implement the Act in this manner is based on my considered\u00a0 judgement which recognises the significant impact some aspects of this Act has on insurers&rsquo; operations, whilst at the same time proceeding with the wider reforms this Act provides.

In light of this, work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021. Consequently, there is a range of potential expenditure requirements that need to be worked through in detail.  At this stage, on a no policy change basis, and assuming an improved position in relation to employment next year based on the latest macroeconomic projections, it is estimated that there could be a cost of approximately &euro;9 billion in relation to Covid-19 expenditure reflecting:<\/p>  <p>  - the carryover costs of the July stimulus programme;<\/p>  <p>  - significant expenditure on automatic stabilisers including job-seekers payments and related supports;- ongoing costs in health to deal with Covid-19;<\/p>  <p>  - the carryover costs relating to both the Roadmap for Reopening Schools, and to the package of supports to enable further and higher education students to return to college;<\/p>  <p>  - And the ongoing requirement to fund public transport while employees continue to be encouraged to work from home.<\/p>  <p>  Further details will be set out in detail in the 2021 Expenditure Report. It should be noted that these pressures will be dealt with separately from core expenditure increases and given their scale, will form a significant part of budgetary package. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to core expenditure programmes, &euro;70.4 billion in gross voted expenditure was allocated to Departments in the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) 2020 published in December 2019.

Work is also ongoing in finalising these costs, and on the emerging core expenditure position for this year for this year. Outside of these expenditure pressures, it is estimated that there is an amount of &euro;0.9 billion available to meet other day to day pressures on existing services across all areas of Government. <\/p>  <p>   In relation to Capital expenditure, we will also ensure that the increase in capital investment set out in the National Development Plan is implemented in order to support the recovery in the economy. This would see core gross voted capital expenditure of almost &euro;9.2 billion next year, an increase of almost &euro;1 billion on the gross voted expenditure amount set out for this year in REV 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, Budget 2021 will also be prepared on the assumption that the trading relationship between the UK and EU will be on WTO terms in 2021.

OPW staff working at these sites which included locations such as John F. Kennedy Arboretum in New Ross, Kilkenny Castle Parkland, Doneraile Park, Glebe Gallery Gardens in Donegal and the Phoenix Park in Dublin continued to work to care for and present the properties to the highest standards while ensuring the safety of all visitors to our sites. <\/p>  <p>  In May, the Government published the road map for reopening society and the economy which set out very specific phasing for the reopening of outdoor and indoor visitor facilities including museums, galleries and heritage attractions. In line with this roadmap of phased reopening, the OPW developed a clear plan for how various heritage sites nationwide would return to operation across Phases 1 -4 and what facilities would be available to patrons. A key part of the approach is to ensure that sites could only reopen where it is possible to do so in accordance with public health guidance and, in particular, with the Return to Work Safely Protocol published by Government. In addition, the OPW emphasised the need to address the needs of vulnerable groups and has made special provision at certain sites in relation to people who have been cocooning. This plan was published on line and clearly set out for example if car parking, toilets and cafes were open, operational and what level of service visitors could be expect.<\/p>  <p>The vast majority of OPW Heritage sites with Visitor services therefore reopened to the public by Phase 3 (June 29th  ). The majority are operating with some form of changes e.g. no group tours or self-guide visits only, in order to meet the public health guidelines for social distancing, the safe return to work of our staff and the safe return of visitors to our attractions. <\/p>  <p>  There are certain tourism site locations however where the position cannot be mitigated sufficiently to operate safely and so these locations must therefore remain closed in the short term and possibly for the remainder of the 2020 visitor season. This very limited number of sites includes for example, Skellig Michael.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to admission charges and access, in July, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Economic Stimulus Package the Government announced an initiative to support local tourism and the restarting of the hospitality sector by providing free or reduced admission to OPW heritage sites nationwide. The purpose of this was to ensure that domestic visitors would choose to holiday at home but would also choose to explore the national heritage estate across the country and our heritage sites would act as significant attractors of tourism in their locales. <\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased to advise that OPW Heritage Services has engaged with the Failte Ireland Covid Safety Charter and a large number of sites have been audited and certified with the Covid Safety certificate. Visitors can be assured that sites are operating to the highest safety standards and OPW is delivering a very safe and enjoyable experience for both our staff and our visitors.<\/p>  <p>  During the summer as a measure of our confidence in the strength of our visitor offering OPW also formally opened a number of new heritage offerings such as the Viewing Point at the Blaskets Centre in Kerry and the newly refurbished Carlingford Castle in Co.

To this end, the recently published plan for living with Covid 19 sets out clear guidance for what can and cannot continue to operate at the various levels in the plan. For example in Dublin which is now at Level 3, a number of indoor heritage attractions are closed to the public for three weeks including Dublin Castle and Kilmainham Gaol. However popular outdoor sites which can remain open at Level 3 such as the National Botanic Gardens, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the Iveagh Gardens are fully open to the public, seven days a week. <\/p>  <p>  I would encourage the public to consult Heritageireland.ie and opw.ie to access the most up-to-date information on access to our sites which are open to visitors. OPW heritage properties which continue to play an important part in supporting local tourism across the Country. A number of iconic sites including Rock of Cashel, Kilkenny Castle and Bru na Boinne will remain fully open to the public throughout the Winter in line with the prevailing public health advices and government restrictions as they might apply in the months ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[26271\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on the outcome of his recent visit to County Louth to progress CFRAM works for the area; his further views on the status of CFRAM schemes relating to other areas in the county (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this issue in relation to the outcome of my recent visit to Co Louth to progress CFRAM works for the area; and the status of CFRAM Schemes in the area specifically, Drogheda, Dundalk and Blackrock south, Carlingford-Greenore, Baltray, Ardee and Mornington (Co. Meath).<\/p>  <p>  Through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, detailed engineering analysis, assessment and extensive public consultation was undertaken for 300 communities throughout Ireland, including 90 coastal areas, which in 2012 were identified as being most likely to be impacted by future coastal and fluvial flooding.  The CFRAM Programme studied 80% of properties at risk from the primary causes of flooding in Ireland, in communities that house almost two thirds of the national population.<\/p>  <p>  The key outputs of the CFRAM Programme were Flood Maps showing the flood risk for the 300 communities, which support planning decisions and emergency response, and Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP&rsquo;s) - one for each River Basin in the country. The FRMP&rsquo;s contain proposed flood relief measures - informed by costs, benefits and environmental factors - to address the flood risk in each community and nationwide. As portions of County Louth are located in two River Basins, Louth is included in both the Neagh-Bann and Boyne FRMP&rsquo;s.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence provided by the CFRAM Programme, which was launched by the Office of Public Works in May 2018, supports the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1bn planned investment to complete 151 flood relief schemes through the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project 2040.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of this, Louth County Council, working with the Office of Public Works, has agreed to be the Lead Authority in the delivery of flood relief schemes at Dundalk \/ Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford \/ Greenore, Baltray and Ardee, all of which are in the first tranche of projects to be progressed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Dundalk \/ Blackrock South, Co. Louth, for which the current estimated total project cost is &euro;80.9 million (this also includes the budget for the Ardee Flood Relief Scheme) would involve a series of hard defences, including flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties, protecting 1,880 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Drogheda, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a preliminary total cost of &euro;16.83 million, would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne and improvement of conveyance, hard defences and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries, protecting 381 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Carlingford and Greenore, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a preliminary total cost of &euro;23.41 million would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Ardee, Co. Louth will also be progressed directly by Louth County Council in tandem with the Dundalk\/Blackrock South Scheme with full funding from the Office of Public Works, the cost of which is included in the budget for that Scheme. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 7 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - There is one proposed scheme initially not included in the first tranche of implementation. The scheme at Baltray, Co. Louth at a projected cost estimate of approximately &euro;1.93 million would involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 73 properties when completed. However, the countywide project steering group comprising Office of Public Works and local authority representatives, has decided to progress the development of this project simultaneously with that for Drogheda. <\/p>  <p>  While the CFRAM process investigated possible structural flood relief measures for both Annagassan and Termonfeckin, economically viable schemes for these communities were not identified, and so a review of the risk in these communities and the likely costs and benefits is to be undertaken to determine if viable schemes may be available.  The Office of Public Works has put in place a process for undertaking such reviews as recommended in the FRMPs nationally, which is currently being piloted in a number of areas, and it is envisaged that these reviews, including those for Annagassan and Termonfeckin, will be complete within the next 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  In Co. Meath, the CFRAM process also identified an outline flood relief scheme for Mornington, and this was included among the priority schemes to be progressed in an initial tranche of flood projects announced by Minister of State Moran on 3 May 2018.  The Office of Public Works is currently engaging with Meath County Council to determine how best to proceed with appointing consultants to progress the project-level development and assessment of this Flood Relief Scheme, including environmental assessment as necessary and further public consultation, for refinement and preparation for planning \/ Exhibition and, if and as appropriate, implementation.  Meath County Council has informed the Office of Public Works that they should be in a position to commence work on appointing consultants in Q4 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  When developing detailed Flood Risk Management options for the selected projects, the adaptability of the option to climate change will also be assessed; for example, in a Project where a significant increase in risk is shown under the future scenarios, options with the best climate change adaptability are more important, whereas climate change adaptability in Projects with low-sensitivity is not as critical.  The appointed Design Teams will produce the detailed design of the options in areas of high sensitivity and will assess whether it is appropriate for the option to be designed to handle climate change from the start of the design process, or whether it is designed to be adaptable later, e.g. building extra capacity into the foundations of a wall to allow it to be increased in the future, or to leave undeveloped areas for flood storage to be added in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has also established Engineering Consultancy Framework Agreements, which Louth County Council are using to procure services to progress the design, development and planning of each project and which will help to speed up the process to construction. In addition, the Council has been provided with additional staffing resources by OPW to assist in the implementation of these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group for flood relief schemes in County Louth has proposed the following prioritisation for progression of first tranche projects for County Louth:<\/p>  <p>   1. Dundalk\/Blackrock South and Ardee - to be progressed simultaneously. The tender for Engineering Consultancy Services for Dundalk \/ Blackrock South and Ardee was advertised on 16 October 2019, with five tenders received on 24 January 2020. Tenders have been evaluated and the contract has been awarded. <\/p>  <p>  2. Drogheda and Baltray - to be progressed simultaneously. The consultants brief for Drogheda and Baltray scheme is currently being finalised and is hoped to be advertised to the framework in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  3. Carlingford\/Greenore. Progress on the Carlingford \/ Greenore consultants brief will begin following completion of the Drogheda \/ Baltray brief. <\/p>  <p>   The Steering Group last met on 24 September 2020 where the project is now being progressed with the consultants now appointed on the Scheme.  Louth County Council is expected to tender for environmental and design consultants for the Drogheda and Baltray Flood Relief Schemes in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the measures set out in the flood risk management plans are not definitive and final, and that as part of the project-level assessment required to prepare the measure for planning\/ Public Exhibition, more detailed assessments are required at a local level and further public and stakeholder consultation will be undertaken. As such, there is further scope for the community's views to influence the measures that are progressed to implementation. <\/p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress each scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[26728\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress that has been made on public sector pay deal negotiations; and if there is a planned increase in public sector pay.","asker":"1628","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I have instructed my officials to engage in exploratory talks with public services committee of ICTU to see if there is a basis for a successor agreement to the Public Service Stability Agreement to ensure pay stability, industrial peace and the delivery of quality public services.<\/p><p>To date there has been constructive engagement between the public service management and the Public Services Committee of ICTU as part of exploratory discussions.  <\/p><p>A new collective agreement could play an important role in underpinning economic recovery, avoiding industrial unrest and supporting the delivery of quality public services at a critical time.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It is a basic principle of public procurement that competitive tendering should be used except in justifiably exceptional circumstances. The EU Directives acknowledge that there can be legitimate reasons for awarding contracts without the use of a competitive process, such as extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events or where there is a single supplier to perform the contract.

I am acutely aware of the impact that the recent flooding has had on individual households and on communities at large.  Since taking up my current position I have visited a number of areas affected by the recent storms, witnessed the damage caused and met and spoken with the people and business owners directly affected.  <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that people want assurance that the Government can provide support to them in response to a flood event and also assurance that it is planning to mitigate the risk from flooding in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Framework for Major Emergency Management underpins coordination of response to all emergencies in Ireland, including flooding.  Through that Framework, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the Lead Government Department with national responsibility for co-ordinating the response to Severe Weather Emergencies including flooding.  Local Authorities are designated as &ldquo;lead agency&rdquo; for response to flooding events within their administrative areas and for ensuring that effective arrangements are put in place to receive and respond to public service weather warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to recognise the proactive planning of the Local Authorities in putting in place temporary flood defences and putting response staff on standby in preparation for these recent weather events. Their planning and rapid response to flood events helped to mitigate the damage and devastation caused. Each local area has its own individual plan in the event of flooding.  An Garda S&iacute;ochana, Civil Defence and the HSE are all involved in these plans and I want too to acknowledge their work in responding to the recent floods. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the OPW is co-ordinating Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to flood risk management across three strategic policy areas - Prevention, Protection and Preparedness.  The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group was established for the purpose of examining the potential non-structural measures that will inform the ten-year implementation strategy of the Flood Risk Management Plans and to ensure that policies that can benefit communities directly &ndash; to be prepared for and respond to flood risk, are carefully considered. <\/p>  <p>  The Government also established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group in 2016 to support existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State Agencies involved with the River Shannon. <\/p>  <p>  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance activities at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen and a study on the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir.  In October 2019, the Group agreed to a &euro;7m strategic programme of maintenance and the removal of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; on the bed of the River Shannon at the Callows Region between Athlone and Meelick Weir.  Progression of these works will be subject to the full environmental assessments required and planning consent to proceed.  The decision to undertake these projects was noted by the Government in December 2019. Waterways Ireland has advised that it has commenced work on advancing the various interventions for these works with implementation expected to commence in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  This investment as well as helping to manage flooding can support the tourism, navigation and agricultural sectors for this region. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the water levels on the River Shannon, the ESB manages the weirs, sluices and other works that are part of the Shannon Scheme, and the water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. The levels in between the lakes are managed by Waterways Ireland for navigation purposes.  Both organisations are members of the Group and communicate on a daily basis to ensure a co-ordinated approach to managing water levels on the river.  Queries arising on the protocols for managing the water levels at any given time should be directed to the ESB and Waterways Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to planning to mitigate flood damage in the future - on 3rd May 2018, the Office of Public Works launched 29 Flood Risk Management Plans and &euro;1bn investment in flood risk over the coming decade. These Plans are the output from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme - the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State.  The Plans set out the measures proposed to address the flood risk nationally, and include 119 new schemes to protect towns, villages and cities nationally.  These include flood relief schemes recommended for both Rahan and Birr, Co. Offaly.  Procurement of 60 of the 119 flood relief schemes is now progressing or, in some places, complete.  These schemes will together with the 46 already complete (including a scheme in Tullamore, Co. Offaly) mean that 95% of at risk properties will be protected by Flood Relief Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to conclude by assuring the Deputy and the Members of this House that I and the Government are working extremely hard to ensure that the greatest possible progress is made over the next number of years on the continued delivery of a very ambitious programme of investment in flood defence and flood risk management measures.  The commitment of &euro;1 billion in the National Development Plan to this objective is a clear sign of how high a priority this is for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[26725\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a commitment will be given to not renew FEMPI when it comes before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>The Public Service Pay and Pension Act 2017 provides for the restoration of reductions made to public service pay and pensions by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2010-2013.

These are:<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting the productive capacity of the economy;<\/p>  <p>  - Eventually setting a path to a lower and more sustainable debt and deficit ratios; and<\/p>  <p>  - Building resilience to future shocks. <\/p>  <p>  The Governor acknowledges the significant supports that have been put in place thus far in response to Covid-19 and notes that the scale of these supports has helped to contain the extent of the downturn and mitigate some of its impact. In terms of protecting the productive capacity of the economy, this is something that the Government has prioritised. It is clear that the labour market has borne much of the economic impact of the crisis to date. Significant steps have been taken to cushion the impact of this on households and firms and to minimise the potential longer term effects on businesses and employment. Protecting incomes and supporting business through this time has been a central element of the Covid-19 crisis. This is reflected in the level of additional funding allocated in 2020 including:<\/p>  <p>  - over &euro;9 billion for income support and job activation schemes bringing total Social Protection spend to over &euro;30 billion; and<\/p>  <p>  - approximately &euro;1&frac12; billion provided for a range of business supports to help firms that have been impacted by the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  As we  look towards the medium term a crucial part of any sustainable expenditure strategy is prudent use of funds. There are a number of processes and frameworks already in place that aim to embed value for money, efficiency and effectiveness in public expenditure policy. This includes initiatives such as Performance Budgeting and the Spending Review process. These projects are important pillars in evidence-based approaches to policy development. <\/p>  <p>  Looking at the economic, social and environmental return generated from expenditure, there are also frameworks in place which aim to examine the ways in which public expenditure impacts on peoples&rsquo; lives and wellbeing. Equality Budgeting, which was introduced in 2017, considers the budget as a process that embodies long-standing societal choices about how resources are used, rather than simply a neutral process of resource allocation. Dedicated equality indicators are included in the REV and, since 2017, the Public Service Performance Report has included an Equality Budgeting Update. <\/p>  <p>  Further to this, the Programme for Government set out a commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; to use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people. Officials in my Department are now preparing a programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment, building on the experience to date with Performance and Equality Budgeting. <\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives are about ensuring that public services are being delivered in the best possible way, identifying and acting on areas for improvement over time and making sure that the citizen is at the heart of policy decisions. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as Budget 2021 is now fast approaching, budget discussions are well underway. Official level bilateral meetings have been underway for a number of weeks. I am engaging with my Ministerial colleagues over the coming weeks with a view to agreeing allocations for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE04250"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[26269\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900069#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way in which the OPW plans to develop its policy on flood relief and flood mitigation in view of the significant climate change challenges that Ireland faces over the coming years.","asker":"1483","askee":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":222,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[26475\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of civil servants recruited with a competence to do their business both through Irish and English in each of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is the independent, statutory body which provides professional recruitment and selection services for appointments to the Civil Service.<\/p><p>Irish language usage is a core Government policy objective as stated in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and its associated 5-Year Action Plan for the period 2018 to 2022.

Scattery Island in Co. Clare is another such example; in the week ending 16<sup>th<\/sup>August, the site had 893 visitors, an increase of over 123% over the total of 400 for the same week in 2019.I know the Deputy will also be interested to hear that Portumna Castle in Galway, which experienced an overall drop in the period of about 36% nevertheless has had a similarly strong performance in August.In the week to the 16<sup>th<\/sup>August for example, the site had 2,169 visitors, an approximately 55% increase on the same week last year.All these 3 sites which I mention have a strong outdoor element which is obviously particularly prized by visitors currently and as such their performance, as I say, reflects the broader experience nationally.<\/p><p>Clearly, with only partial statistics available and many sites experiencing particular local constraints, it is too early to arrive at any definitive results for the year overall.I remain personally convinced however that making the majority of OPW&rsquo;s paid admission sites available free of charge was a necessary and an opportune move and will have helped at a local level to sustain, even if only in a small way, many other attractions and tourism businesses through an exceptionally difficult period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[26272\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to bring the landmark site, St. Laurence&rsquo;s Gate, Drogheda town centre back into use and open to the public to draw much needed tourism to the town; if a financial assessment has been undertaken to ascertain the overall cost to bring the landmark back into use; if so, the cost; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>As I have indicated to the Deputy in a recent Parliamentary Reply, the Office of Public Works are open to the idea that the St. Laurence's Gate Monument in Drogheda would in future be available to visitors and would play a part in the tourism attractions within the town. Indeed, access to the public is already available on special occasions such as Heritage Week, Fleadh Ceol etc and this will continue to be the case.  However, opening the site on a more permanent basis is challenging because of a number of factors and as I explained in my recent reply, is dependent on the successful resolution of two major issues in particular which must be addressed in sequence:<\/p>  <p>  - the structural condition of the building, which is poor currently<\/p>  <p>  and<\/p>  <p>  - the need to develop a sustainable and efficient visitor presentation model<\/p>  <p>  In regards to the necessary works, I think it has been well understood in PQ responses by my predecessor that there are multiple serious structural issues with the building and I believe former Minister Moran widely shared the relevant Structural report with local public representatives. Currently the OPW are working on a range of project solutions for this work. I cannot at this stage promise the Deputy when that will come to fruition as there are many challenges currently at various National Monument sites throughout the North East and many demands on the OPW team in that area. However, I can assure the Deputy that we will make every effort to progress the project as quickly as is feasible.<\/p>  <p>  The visitor management issue is, in fact, potentially much more challenging and I would suggest will require the participation of a number of actors outside the OPW to resolve it. The Gate building is very confined and has a very limited access so it can only admit a small number of people at any one time. It is unlikely therefore to ever be a high visitor volume proposition and will in all likelihood remain as a local visitor site rather than a national attraction. Ideally, in OPW's view, it should be managed locally and, to this end, OPW have had a number of discussions with Louth Co. Council to try and see if this can be achieved. No firm outcomes have emerged to date from this but I would like perhaps to take this opportunity to seek the Deputy's own advice and assistance in making progress on this. It may be that there is a local group, such as a business development organisation or a historical society who might be willing to work in partnership with the OPW on this issue, perhaps sponsoring a T&Uacute;S trainees or a volunteer group. Is there perhaps a possibility that a local keyholder might be available to manage the access on the ground on request, as happens in many other locations managed by the OPW around the country?<\/p>  <p>  There has been good progress on working with local organisations on these kinds of initiatives in a number of places - including most recently Carlingford Castle which I visited a few weeks ago - where strong partnerships have emerged to work collaboratively on issues such as these and perhaps that should be the focus in Drogheda also. I would therefore encourage the Deputy if he has any ideas on this front to bring them to me and I will certainly have them considered by my officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[25021\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when a feasibility study will be carried out on the future need for a tidal barrier in County Cork in view of the rising sea levels","asker":"1453","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to a feasibility study the on the future need for a tidal barrier for Cork City. <\/p><p>The option of a tidal barrier for Cork City, in particular, was considered, both as part of the Lee Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study that commenced in 2006, and the Lower Lee Flood Relief scheme that commenced in 2013, and was screened out in both studies as not being viable. <\/p><p>As part of a range of reports undertaken for the Lower Lee Scheme, a detailed report on the option of a tidal carrier was completed.

Mayo. <\/p>  <p>  There were some delays to the programme as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, due to the consultants being unable to carry out the final environmental surveys during the nationwide lockdown. Since the easing of restrictions, the consultants carried out the final elements of these environmental surveys, and the project team are now in the process of finalising this suite of documents for the confirmation process. It is anticipated that the scheme documents will be finalised and submitted to DPER in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme now requires formal confirmation to proceed from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER). This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts , which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This will involve, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal confirmation process.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist the MPER in making an informed decision to consent to the scheme, the EIA will require appropriate assessment, as required under the 2019 regulations, public consultation for a period of 30 days and a detailed technical review of the scheme by environmental consultants appointed by the MPER.  <\/p>  <p>  If DPER find that they are satisfied with the proposed scheme, the next stage in the process will be the construction phase. In order to expedite this timeline, the project team will prepare for construction in parallel with DPER&rsquo;s review. This will ensure that we are in a position to mobilise as soon as we are given approval to implement the flood defences for the town of Crossmolina. It is anticipated that the construction phase will take up to 24 months to complete. This may be subject to change as otherwise unforeseen issues may become apparent once the construction team are on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to preparing for the flood threat in winter of this year, Mayo County Council, with funding provided by the OPW, have already rolled out an Individual Property Protection project, which has provided flood gates to over 100 residents in the town of Crossmolina. Additionally, the OPW has also approved Mayo County Council&rsquo;s (MCC)&rsquo;s application for funding for a number of minor works projects in the town, and these have been put in place by Mayo County Council. Since 2016, &euro;230,000 has been approved for minor works in Crossmolina. And finally, the OPW Western Drainage Maintenance Section have carried out a number of maintenance works along the River Deel, and continue to do so in line with their maintenance plan.

The Deputy may be aware that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. It is the posiiton that this matter was discussed extensively at meetings of the Community Sector High Level Forum between public service management, which included inter alia officials from my Department, and union representatives. My Department carried out a detailed scoping exercise in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications, in both cost and precedent terms, of the issues involved. The outcome to the scoping exercise was that the matter has potentially very significant implications for the exchequer, particularly if consequential demands were to be made by all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors. <\/p>  <p>  This is a factor which must be borne in mind in our approach to this issue.

This year Christmas will be like no other but OPW is committed to ensuring that buildings and properties which traditionally presented a range of events at Christmas will continue to do so at a reduced scale and in line with the prevailing public health guidelines and Government restrictions as they might apply at the time.  <\/p>  <p>  OPW visitor sites have always been seen as not themselves primary generators of income, but as anchor attractions that draw people into local areas around the country, enabling private sector businesses to service the tourists they bring and driving secondary spending locally. This has always been a strong attribute of the Heritage visitor portfolio and the OPW sites around the country will I think continue to participate to drive and support local tourism enterprise in this way for the 2020 Christmas season. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, all activity at heritage sites will have to undertaken in line with public health guidelines and Government restrictions relating to Covid 19. OPW is currently examining the roadmap for living with Covid19 which the Government published last week. In particular, officials are examining the thresholds in relation to indoor and outdoor events with a view to planning what Christmas programmes might be possible at the various levels in the roadmap.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that at Dublin Castle for example, &lsquo;Christmas at the Castle&rsquo;, which was a highly successful event in Dublin City last year will likely proceed albeit at a reduced scale.  This event is devised in collaboration with Dublin City Council. It will feature as part of Failte Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winter in Dublin&rsquo; campaign to encourage Irish citizens to visit Dublin City in the run up to Christmas if possible and within the context of the prevailing public health guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  A reduced programme of outdoor Christmas events will be presented at Farmleigh House, the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre and the National Botanic Gardens. At Kilkenny Castle, the team is examining what, if any, indoor events can proceed and will be working closely with Kilkenny County Council to ensure a Christmas programme at the Castle supports the local tourism economy over the season. <\/p>  <p>  A number of OPW Heritage sites remain open to the public for people to visit during the Winter season and a range of our usual tours and self-guide opportunities at sites will continue to be available. OPW publishes very detailed information in relation to the operation of all heritage sites, including details of all events, on heritageireland.ie. Full details of all sites which are open in December and indeed all events taking place over the Christmas season will be published in due course online both here and on site-specific web pages and social media channels. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF06500"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[26409\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900070#WRF06600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if funding will be made available for the Glashaboy flood relief scheme, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>I am advised that the Glashaboy Flood Relief Scheme has been submitted by the Office of Public Works, under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts, accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) and Natura Impact Statement (NIS), to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for formal Confirmation.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, which were published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 27 September 2019, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has undertaken an environmental assessment of the proposed scheme in line with required legislative requirements.

The introduction of travel restrictions around the world is already, for example, disrupting the typical way in which the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, which are also faced by our competitor countries, IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year have demonstrated the resilience of our FDI base. The Agency has secured over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs. Almost half of these new projects were secured for locations outside Dublin, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that these 2020 investments reflect our continuing attractiveness to overseas firms. Overseas companies continue, the evidence would suggest, to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible work-force, a track record as a successful home to global businesses and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we do recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and we are under no illusions that the time ahead will prove more challenging.

The events industry is comprised of a number of diverse industry sectors comprising a mixture of large and small firms. Many event industry firms do currently use large online platforms to generate income, increase online visibility and to reach new international markets. These online platforms are key enablers of entrepreneurship, digital trade and innovation. Ireland has a strong base of firms in the audio visual and digital technologies that can partner with those in the events industry on new modes of developing and distributing content. <\/p>  <p>  The digital economy permeates all aspects of society, influencing the way people interact and bringing about broad societal changes.  The current COVID-19 crisis has brought this into even sharper relief by highlighting the dependence for both individuals and businesses, particularly SMEs, now have on the digital economy and, in particular, online digital platforms through their disruptive digital technologies and the services they provide. <\/p>  <p>  On 9 September last my colleague the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin, T.D, announced a new pilot &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; to assist commercial promoters and producers to employ artists, musicians, performers, technicians and other support staff in live performances, which may subsequently have to be curtailed, cancelled or postponed due to Covid-19.  The key aim of &ldquo;Live performance Support Scheme&rdquo; is to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances to provide employment to workers in the creative industries while also producing high quality live performances for the public.<\/p>  <p>  It is proving particularly challenging for project promoters currently to implement social distancing while also being commercially viable for live performances to take place.  The sector is proactively working to implement measures to enable their industry to reopen as soon as it is safe, practicable and viable to do so; and this scheme aims to support the live performance sector in achieving this. Applicants can apply for a grant from &euro;10,000 to a maximum of &euro;800,000 on a matched funding basis which can be used to fund a percentage of eligible costs. <\/p>  <p>  For micro- business in the events sector, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in each county provide access to training, mentoring and funding assistance for those considering their digital transformation strategies. As part of the Government's July Stimulus Package, we have expanded the LEO's Trading Online Voucher Scheme to assist small businesses with up to 10 employees to trade more online, boost sales and reach new markets.

There can be no doubt about the difficulties these sectors have faced in recent months due to the impact of social distancing requirements and large gatherings.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has had recent engagement with those representing the events sector.  Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation Mr. Robert Troy TD, is also in ongoing contact with sector representatives.  The Minister of State for Employment Affairs and Retail Businesses, Mr. Damien English TD, recently met with representatives of the newly formed Events Industry Ireland (EII), which represents event professionals and business owners from the Irish events industry.  Discussions were held concerning the adverse effects of COVID- 19 on the events sector in general, the Government supports available to sectors and to certain suggestions which the EII had put forward to assist their sector to recover. Some of these suggestions included potential for funding for business transformation both digital and environmental, a tax incentivisation scheme and further assistance with finance \/ loan forbearance and on insurance issues.  <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;7.4 billion July Jobs Stimulus Plan itself provides scope for some businesses within the events sector to avail of the continuation of measures such as the income support package consisting of the PUP extension and the employment wage support scheme and additional liquidity, enterprise investment and taxation measures.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government's COVID-19 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19' specifically deals with organised events and we will continue to work with the industry to progress the development of agreed protocols and innovative ways to enable the hosting of such organised events into the future.  Government will also continue to work with the sector to explore what supports are available through Enterprise Ireland to assist events businesses transform and change their business models by availing of innovation and technology over the longer term.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the wider range of supports now available, there may be scope for some businesses within the events sector to avail of the new measures introduced by the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Ms. Catherine Martin TD, under the July stimulus package. For example, Minister Martin announced on 9th September last an allocation of &euro;5 million under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The scheme will help to de-risk the costs of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by the Department of Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  A further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.

The supports available from Government are designed to help businesses to open, to help those that are already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, to transition to new opportunities as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  On 23 July the Government announced the July Stimulus Package, a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, with an additional &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees. These new measures are in addition to those already announced since the onset of the Pandemic, including the Temporary Wage Subsidy, the Restart Grant and Restart Grant Plus, grant supports. cash for businesses, low cost loans and commercial rates waivers. <\/p>  <p>  Significantly, to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hires, we have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which will run until the end of March 2021 and we have also improved eligibility criteria for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. In addition:<\/p>  <p>  - We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  - We announced a six-month reduction in VAT, going from 23% down to 21%, together with a range of additional measures designed to stimulate domestic demand. <\/p>  <p>  - We also announced a &euro;2 million assistance fund for Micro-Enterprises that cannot avail of any sectoral specific supports. <\/p>  <p>  The range of measures in place to assist businesses include direct grants and supports such as the:<\/p>  <p>  - Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)<\/p>  <p>  - The Restart Grant Plus<\/p>  <p>  - Liquidity supports such as 0% finance for 6 months from MicroFinance Ireland<\/p>  <p>  - Low cost working capital is also available through the SBCI schemes<\/p>  <p>  - State-backed Future Growth Loan Scheme which makes available longer-term lending for strategic investment, with &euro;500 million expansion of the scheme <\/p>  <p>  The Retail Forum, an initiative of my Department, provides a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and government on key concerns for the retail sector, including COVID-19 and Brexit. My colleague, Damien English TD Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail chairs the Retail Forum and continues to engage with the retail sector through this Forum.  The most recent meeting of the Retail Forum was on 24 September 2020.  Additionally, in recent weeks, Minister English has held a series of one-to-one introductory bilateral meetings with the retail representative bodies as members of the Retail Forum.<\/p>  <p>  Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term.  The COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme - a competitive scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. <\/p>  <p>  My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. The Scheme was launched with an initial fund size of &euro;2m. Due to significant levels of interest for the Scheme from eligible retailers and the particular challenges facing the retail sector during the pandemic, the funding available for Call 1 was increased. On the 2 July 2020, I was pleased to announce that 185 retailers were approved &euro;6.6m in funding as part of the scheme. A second Call, with a total fund size of &euro;5.5m. which was launched by Minister of State English closed on the 28 September 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme administered through the Local Enterprise Offices. As part of the July Jobs Stimulus the Scheme was expanded to assist even more small and micro enterprises, with no more than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector, to get online quickly. Although not designed exclusively for the retail sector it provides significant assistance to retailers to start to trade online. Following a previous expansion of the Scheme in early April, total additional funding for the Scheme is now almost &euro;20m in 2020. Under the Scheme, small businesses can claim up to &euro;5,000 in two vouchers worth &euro;2,500 each. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector and will work closely with my colleague Minister English and the Retail Forum in ensuring that the needs of the sector are considered including in the development of forthcoming National Economic Plan. I expect that the Plan will set longer term objectives for the economy post crisis and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. The Plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900071#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[26283\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900071#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"if further stimulus plans will be introduced targeting the retail and hospitality sector, in view of the significant reduction in turnover and the closure of many; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>I am aware that the economic impact of COVID-19 has not been the same across all sectors of the economy. For some sectors, especially those that require personal contact with customers, such as retail and hospitality, it has been more difficult to adapt to social distancing requirements.  Amongst the most heavily-impacted are those where the duration of the disruption, ongoing restrictions on international mobility and distancing requirements necessary to prevent spread of the virus, remain a barrier to capacity or resumption of normal activity and productivity.<\/p>  <p>  The priority of the Government continues to be the wellbeing of our people and communities and the best economic policy is to put public health first. But we are increasingly focussing on business and on getting as many people as possible back to work.<\/p>  <p>  To date the Government has provided enhanced provisions to a value of almost &euro;20 billion. While these supports are wide ranging, they will by their nature be of most assistance to the most heavily impacted firms and sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work. Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses, including those in the retail and hospitality sector, will be able to benefit from many of the actions within the July Stimulus including:<\/p>  <p>  - The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and its successor the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme has, and will provide, absolutely critical assistance to impacted businesses right across the economy.  For the most heavily impacted sectors such as hospitality, the schemes will give businesses a chance to resume activity while operating under the constraints demanded by public health requirements by heavily subsidising probably their largest variable cost.  <\/p>  <p>  - The Online Retail Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, helps support companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer. To date, funding under this scheme has been provided to 185 retailers with a total of over &euro;6.5 million awarded.  <\/p>  <p>  - We have provided substantial Restart Grants of up to &euro;25,000 to a broad category of businesses such as hairdressers, sports clubs, cafes, restaurants, B&amp;Bs, independent hotels to help cover the costs incurred during closure and reopening costs. By the 4th September, approvals to the value of &euro;155 million were approved under the Restart Grant and &euro;187 million under the enhance Restart Grant; a total of &euro;342 million.<\/p>  <p>  - We have introduced a temporary reduction in VAT from 23% to 21%, this will assist retail in particular but also benefit many other sectors of the economy.  <\/p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;Stay and Spend&rsquo; initiative will see consumers benefit by up to &euro;125 each for expenditure on hospitality activities during the traditional &lsquo;off peak&rsquo; for this sector. <\/p>  <p>  - We also allocated &euro;10 million to a Restart Fund for the Tourism Sector to aid recovery.<\/p>  <p>  - Recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on pubs, bars and nightclubs, and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening, an additional &euro;16 million support package for the sector was announced at the end of August. This included a 40% Restart Grant Plus Top Up for pubs, bars and nightclubs that remain closed to help them to reopen; a waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020; and a waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  - Several other initiatives to provide vital liquidity to all firms who are experiencing impacts have been introduced including rates waivers, delayed payment of PAYE and VAT debts, in part or in full, for a set period with no interest or penalties, and the early carryback of trading losses providing immediate cash-flow support to previously profitable companies.<\/p>  <p>  - Most recently, I announced the opening of the new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide Irish businesses with access to low cost loans as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19. This is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee in Ireland. A large number of non-bank finance providers, including a number of Credit Unions have also applied to participate in the scheme, as part of an open call process. <\/p>  <p>  - The Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 Loan scheme also recently reopened. Under the first phase of this scheme, 687 loans were approved to a value of &euro;18.68 million. This represents three years of normal lending volumes for MFI in a period of just over four months. I expect the new tranche of funding will provide a lifeline to even more micro-enterprises enabling them to re-open, stay afloat or expand.<\/p>  <p>  Having come through the initial economic shock with unprecedented levels of State intervention stabilising the economy, the focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment. As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan. <\/p>  <p>  As per the recent Budget 2021 Strategy announcement, Budget 2021 will see additional crisis-related supports tailored to those sectors and workers who are most in need.<\/p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will set out a vision for what our post-Covid economy will look like. The plan will set longer term objectives for the economy post crisis and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. While the focus of Government action up to now has been on protecting workers, households and firms, the plan will need to look to the future and show how our economy can be positioned to exploit opportunities for growth in emerging sectors and in areas such as new ways of working, while also addressing how we will prepare for the transitioning of enterprises and workers in response to technology and climate change developments. Ireland&rsquo;s flexible and skilled labour force has traditionally been a strength of the country and reskilling and upskilling of the labour force in response to anticipated future skills needs a core element to be progressed under the plan.<\/p>  <p>  The plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900071#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[26284\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900071#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the steps he will take in budget 2021 to support the small and medium enterprise sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>I have been engaging with the Minister of Finance and Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the 2021 budgetary priorities.<\/p><p>I will be focusing in particular on building on the measures in the July Stimulus Package.

The numbers receiving the PUP have fallen from 598,000 at the beginning of May to 206,341 on 22nd September; a decrease of over 65%.  <\/p>  <p>  Over 663,600 employees received a subsidy through the TWSS during its operation. By 17th September, over 34,300 employers had registered with Revenue for the new Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  According to the Revenue data, 85.2% of these employers are in their Business Division which is predominantly comprised of small and micro enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  These schemes have played an important role in maintaining incomes throughout the pandemic. The TWSS has helped to maintain that important link between employers and their workers.  Furthermore, the design of the TWSS has allowed it to provide vital supports to businesses right across the economy, including many of those who continued to trade despite the extremely challenging trading environment of the past few months.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS, which was introduced in the July Stimulus, provides a crucial support to businesses as they resume activity in the face of challenges to their business models brought about by COVID-19.  It represents a weekly subsidy to each job provided by that business, thereby reducing the costs of labour, which are typically amongst the most significant costs incurred by businesses.  The EWSS has broader application than the TWSS; for example it includes employees that were not previously eligible, such as seasonal workers and newly hired personnel.  The EWSS will run until 31 March 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the EWSS, the July Stimulus Package included a variety of measures aimed at retaining jobs and supporting people back into employment through further education and training and labour market activation measures.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise supports include the extension of the Restart Grant and the Commercial Rates Waiver, the introduction of the Credit Guarantee Scheme, additional resources for MicroFinance Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices, an expansion of the Future Growth Loan scheme, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Online Retail and Online Trading Voucher schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Reskilling and Upskilling supports include 12,500 additional places for short-term skills training and 35,000 additional places in further and higher education (Skillnet Ireland, Springboard+, Human Capital Initiative) including 19,000 on the new SOLAS Skills to Compete programme which will support people in developing and attaining qualifications for emerging growth sectors and occupations.  A temporary Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme was introduced along with a Retrofit Skills Training Initiative to support the expansion of the National Retrofitting programme. <\/p>  <p>  Labour activation supports include 8,000 recruitment subsidies under the JobsPlus scheme, an increasing of the capacity of the Public Employment Service to support jobseeker job search advice and assistance, extension of the Back to Work Enterprise and Back to Education Allowances to people currently in receipt of the PUP. Some 10,000 additional work placement\/experience scheme places for those unemployed for over 6 months are also being provided. <\/p>  <p>  While uncertainty remains as to the course and duration of the virus, as well as a threat of a no deal Brexit, a number of forecasts for the medium-term trajectory of the labour market have been published.  The Central Bank in its Quarterly Bulletin, July 2020, under a baseline scenario, projects that unemployment will average 14.5% in 2020, decline to 9.2% in 2021, and decline further to 7.3% in 2022.  Under a severe scenario, it is projected that unemployment will average 16.6% in 2020, decline to 12.4% in 2021 and decline further to 9.4% in 2022.  The Department of Finance forecast in April that unemployment will reach 10.9% by the end of 2020, and 9% by the end of 2021.  The ESRI&rsquo;s Summer 2020 Quarterly Economic Commentary sets out baseline, severe and benign scenarios for unemployment in 2020, of 17%, 19% and 15% respectively. <\/p>  <p>  The focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment. As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will set out a vision for a post-Covid economy and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives.

Anticipating future skills needs, and re-skilling and upskilling of the labour force will be a core element to be progressed under the plan with increased support for job or role transitioning.  The plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of cross government engagement on labour market issues, the Labour Market Advisory Council was set up to provide advice to the Minister and the Government with advice regard to the labour force participation rates, minimising unemployment levels and reducing average unemployment durations. The onset of the pandemic meant that the first task of the Council was to advise on measures to tackle the labour market challenges arising from the pandemic with an aim of supporting broader economic recovery in the State. The Council will also advise on the wider labour market and employment policy challenges that face the Irish economy in the post-pandemic recovery period.  Under its Terms of Reference, a central function of the Council is to advise Government on the development of the Pathways to Work strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The forthcoming Pathways to Work 2020-2025 strategy, which is the Government&rsquo;s overall framework for activation and employment support, is expected to be published in Q4 2020 and will complement the National Economic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) comprises representatives of employers and trade unions with Government Ministers and is chaired by the Taoiseach.

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The\u00a0deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>  As of 29 September, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 96,000 premises surveyed to date. This\u00a0activity is increasing week on week and by year end, NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys.\u00a0<\/p><p>  This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of\u00a0the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose.\u00a0It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The\u00a0laying\u00a0of\u00a0fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. <\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through 'service provider' contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills\u00a0for schools. <\/p><p>  Approximately 300 sites in rural areas are targeted for completion by the end of 2020 including 75 schools.

The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date.

The European Commission recently presented its plan to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment in the Programme for Government to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. <\/p>  <p>  The 2050 target will be set in in the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, which will be introduced in the D&aacute;il in early October. The Climate Action (Amendment) Bill will build on the existing Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, and provide for a significantly strengthened statutory framework for governance of the climate challenge. The Bill will ensure delivery of successive Climate Action Plans and Long-Term Climate Action Strategies, supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sectoral targets with appropriate oversight by Government, the Oireachtas, and a strengthened Climate Change Advisory Council. The proposed Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set, with every sector contributing, ensuring we continue to work to achieve a broad political and societal consensus on a Just Transition to a sustainable future for all communities. The 2015 Act provides for a voluntary contribution to be made from Local Government on climate action;\u00a0the proposed Bill will establish a clear requirement on Local Authorities to develop and publish Climate Action Plans. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the suite of actions recommended and required of the public sector to be\u00a0a leader in addressing climate change. To this end, we are preparing a strategy for a cohesive approach to management, delivery and engagement across the Public Sector Framework for Climate Action. This approach will seek to ensure that the changes made and actions recommended under the Climate Action Plan and in the Programme for Government deliver impact under the targets committed to, support long term change, and are operational across the system.<\/p>  <p>  The actions we are taking should be demonstrably linked to delivering the targets committed to. They should primarily focus on delivering and underpinning the 50% decarbonisation target by 2030 for the public sector. In this context, Government is addressing the issue of ensuring that the climate impact of all policy matters being taken to Government is considered.

Such a refund must be made within 14 days.  Where a flight has been booked directly with an airline, the relevant legal protections are different and fall under EU Regulation 261, which covers the rights of airline passengers in instances of flight cancellations.  Under that Regulation, an airline has 7 days to make a cash refund to its customers when it cancels a flight.  However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law, irrespective of the circumstances.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines have waived flight change fees in circumstances where a flight occurs and people are not able to present because of Government advice, although fare differences and date restrictions may apply.  <\/p>  <p>  Evidently, the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions for countries that are not on the 'Green' list.

The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right.

As the Deputy is aware, Shannon Airport is part of Shannon Group and Shannon Group is availing of these supports which are designed to assist businesses, including our airports in terms of the management of their companies during this unprecedented time.  Government has already also provided emergency funding of &euro;6.1m to Shannon Airport to complete a vital Hold Baggage Screening project - a safety and security requirement under EU Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  The Aviation Recovery Taskforce set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The taskforce report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been badly affected by the almost complete shutdown of international air travel. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right. The Government has already implemented several recommendations, including the extension of the wages subsidy scheme and publication of safe air travel protocols. We have also progressed a European slot rule waiver for airlines in consultation with the European Commission.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to any future support mechanisms for the aviation sector, my Department will continue to work closely with aviation stakeholders and continue to review options in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the Aviation Taskforce.  <\/p>  <p>  I cannot give specific commitments at this time because any further supports that may be considered will be part of the ongoing Budget deliberations, and there are many competing demands on the public purse.

This proposal will now be considered by the Council of Ministers. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have committed to undertaking an examination of the future viability and sustainability of Shannon Group, and I will consider restructuring measures, financial supports and any other measures that may be necessary and appropriate as part of this wider review of Shannon Group.   I will bring recommendations to Government in this regard shortly.   <\/p>  <p>  It is my intention that the Company, including Shannon Airport, will be well positioned for the future particularly given the importance of Shannon Airport to the economy of the Midwest region and indeed nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900075#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900075#WRL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[26957\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900075#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on phase 1 of the Limerick northern distributor road; his plans to advance phase 2 of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.

It does not extend to private property, or to public parks which are under the jurisdiction of local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The user of a scrambler motorbike, a quad bike or similar vehicle, in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, and must also wear a helmet, with severe penalties under the road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements.  It is also, incidentally, and offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a minor. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; means any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.  Road traffic law does not extend to the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on private property.  Certain places, such as parks under the control of local authorities, can be subject to bye-laws, which those authorities have the power to introduce, to prohibit the use of vehicles.  Gardai can also prosecute scrambler and quad bike users in these areas under public order laws.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Department of Justice convened a task force comprising representatives from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice, my Department, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to examine the current legislative provisions in place and to examine whether further laws need to be enacted to deal with the problem of quads and scramblers.  <\/p>  <p>  The taskforce concluded that there is a already a wide suite of legislation available to an Garda Siochana, including road traffic legislation (for using these vehicles illegally in a public place), and public order legislation (for using them on public land).  There is no jurisdiction for using quads or scramblers on private land.  Consideration was given to whether an extension of the concept of 'public place' in the Road Traffic Acts to cover parks would assist in this area.  However, it was concluded following legal advice that the extension of such a fundamental concept in road traffic law in an attempt to address one particular issue would have wide-ranging unintended consequences, and would not be a viable solution.<\/p>  <p>  The Task Force has since met to consider other more precise legal avenues, and will be meeting again shortly to follow up on the options being considered.  Any solution will need to involve a combination of legislation - whether new or existing,- enforcement, public awareness campaigns, and approaches to local youth groups, to educate teens on the dangers of using such vehicles.  I will be happy to consider any recommendations resulting from this process which fall within my remit.<\/p>  <p>  I would add that, whatever the legislation and whether we are talking of a 'public place' or a park, there remains a major difficulty of enforcement.  A Garda giving chase to a youth on a scrambler must be mindful of the safety of other members of the public in the area, and this makes it more difficult to detain the scrambler drivers, whatever the legislation in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[27340\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which applicants for driver's licence renewal who are non-nationals awaiting naturalisation documents with residency permits can be facilitated in having their applications processed when their required identifying documentation and Irish residence permit, IRP, is held up in the Department of Foreign Affairs due to delays caused by Covid-19 measures and in view of the fact that this can cause serious problems in travel and work through no fault of their own; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>Covid-19 has had a profound effect on many services and has caused considerable backlogs in many areas.

Its design reflects the changing environment around the COVID-19 pandemic which has shifted from crisis mode to one of living alongside the virus, in line with the recently announced Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 25 September 2020, there were 36,746 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, over 82% of the employers availing of the TWSS when it finished at the end of August.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations.   The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in\/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  <\/p>  <p>  The EWSS has broader application than the TWSS, for example to include employees that were not previously eligible, such as seasonal workers and newly hired personnel.  The EWSS will also be in place for longer than the TWSS.  The trade-off is that it has been necessary to narrow some other criteria to ensure the EWSS is sustainable in terms of cost. <\/p>  <p>  I would note that the strictest public health measures that were in place in April and May have been eased and so it is reasonable to expect that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses.  At the same time, the retention of a wage subsidy scheme is to recognise that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for some time to come because of the continued need to observe public health requirements such as social distancing.<\/p>  <p>  All the conditions of the turnover test have been carefully calibrated in that regard and there are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS.  <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the administration of the EWSS as well as the uptake and utilisation of this important economy-wide employment measure in the weeks and months ahead to with a view to ensuring that it achieves its objective of supporting viable enterprises and employers. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02100"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[26408\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of businesses who have applied for economic operator and registration identification, EORI, numbers in order to trade with the UK post-Brexit; if there has been a campaign to encourage businesses to apply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that in 2020 to date there have been 4,693 registrations for customs and that since the introduction of the EORI (Economic Operators Registration Identification) number in 2009, 68,856 businesses have registered for customs with Revenue.\u00a0 93% of the import trade with the UK in 2019 was carried out by businesses who now have an EORI number, with 97% of the 2019 export trade with the UK being carried out by businesses who now have an EORI number.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has intensified its trade engagement activities to support businesses in their preparations for Customs formalities from 1 January 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In July, Revenue wrote to 57,000 businesses who traded in goods with the UK since 2019 and who, at that time, were not registered for customs and therefore did not have an EORI number and outlined a range of steps to be taken to get Brexit ready.

The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the executive board of the Judicial Council shortly. While the adoption of those Guidelines will be a matter for the Judicial Council, it is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts. \u00a0Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members. \u00a0I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that prioritising delivery on the commitments\u00a0to insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and this is reflected in the Programme for Government.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02700"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[27203\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if primary medical certificate applications are still being accepted and processed; if not, the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[27329\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if primary medical certificate applications are still being accepted and processed; if not, the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 266 together.<\/p><p>Primary Medical Certificate (PMC)\u00a0assessments are undertaken by Senior Area Medical Officers of the HSE and, in relation to appeals, by the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.

While many households suffered a fall in income in the second quarter of the year, Government schemes such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment offset some of this shock. However, the reduction in spending was much larger than the fall in household disposable income. On one hand the sale of goods and services was restricted due to containment measures. On the other hand, households responded to the uncertain economic environment by building up precautionary savings. While some easing of savings may be expected next year, savings will likely remain elevated relative to historic levels in the face of continued uncertainty surrounding the path of the virus. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has acted decisively to counteract the worst effects of the COVID-19 induced economic shock by providing supports with a total value of around &euro;24.5 billion to date, mostly in the form of labour supports, investment in the health service and through direct supports to businesses. The July Stimulus package, when combined with previously announced measures, represents unprecedented levels of Government intervention in the economy. It is centred on the twin objectives of assisting business and getting as many people back to work as quickly as possible. The measures announced in the July Stimulus Package include a &lsquo;stay and spend&rsquo; initiative to support the hospitality sector, loss relief measures for self-employed individuals and other businesses, and a temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent. \u00a0All of these measures will be beneficial to the retail and hospitality sectors, which have suffered greatly during the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  Due to prudent management of the public finances in recent years, we entered this crisis from a position of strength and resilience and we are now able to run budget deficits in order to provide counter cyclical support to the economy and to promote the retention and creation of jobs.

Its design reflects the changing environment around the COVID-19 pandemic which has shifted from crisis mode to one of living alongside the virus, in line with the recently announced Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19<i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, as of 25 September 2020, there were 36,746 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, over 82% of the employers availing of the TWSS when it finished at the end of August.<\/p><p>I am aware of the concerns that have been raised regarding the pace of recovery for some sectors of the economy and that it has been suggested that the application of the EWSS should be delineated on the basis of explicit sectoral qualification criteria.\u00a0 However, I would note that the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.\u00a0 The EWSS has therefore been deliberately designed as an economy wide measure that is open to all sectors as was the case for the TWSS before it. The availability of the support by reference to a turnover test means that the scheme can be applied across the whole economy while at the same time remain targeted at employers who are considered to be most in need of support, including the sectors mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that the adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.<\/p><p>I will continue to closely monitor the administration of the EWSS as well as the uptake and utilisation of this important economy-wide employment measure in the weeks and months ahead to with a view to ensuring that it achieves its objective of supporting viable enterprises and employers. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary.<\/p><p>For those businesses who need further support, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.\u00a0 Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p><p>Finally, in the case of the sectors highlighted by the Deputy, I would note that my colleague the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Ms. Catherine Martin T.D., has recently announced the establishment and membership of the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force and funding for a Live Performance and Music Industry Support Package.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Any other additional income supports are a matter for the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900076#WRM06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":650,"content":"<p>Question No. 281 answered with Question No. 75.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900077#WRN00400"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[16651\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900077#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a cut to capital gains tax from its current rate of 33% to 25% will be included in the forthcoming budget as promised in the Fianna F&aacute;il pre-election manifesto; and his views on whether it is fair that those who benefited most over the last decade should now receive a large tax cut.","asker":"1579","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that each 1% reduction in the headline rate of CGT is estimated to be &euro;32 million, assuming no behavioural change.

The industry in Ireland is going to become deeper and more diverse. My Department has been working with other relevant Departments and state agencies, such as the IDA, to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland as a committed English-speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU Single Market, our continued access to EU talent and that of the Common Travel Area, in addition to our pro-business environment underpinned by a strong, fully-independent financial services regulator in the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has been focused on the impact of Brexit on financial stability, for which it has statutory responsibility, since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for the end of the transition period on 31 December, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that, while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; financial stability risks arising from Brexit have been largely mitigated.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department recently worked with the ESRI on an examination of the sectoral overlap of COVID-19 and Brexit shocks, which found that there is limited overlap in the sectors exposed to the different shocks, and limited connection between the sectors exposed to each shock. In this regard, exposures to Brexit in the area of financial services should not be magnified by additional exposure to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 Brexit Bill includes a number of measures which will minimise disruption.

This will mean change. The Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published by the Government on 9 September, clearly sets out that firms in the financial services sector should finalise their readiness and contingency plans and take necessary actions in accordance with the relevant European Commission guidance. In addition, the Central Bank website contains FAQs on Brexit which are targeted at both financial services firms and consumers. My Department will continue to work closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA to monitor the situation as we get closer to the end of transition, and to identify any emerging risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900077#WRN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[27245\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900077#WRN04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he sees the double threat from Covid-19 and Brexit to impact on the economy here; if he remains satisfied that provision can be made to cater for the challenges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>As COVID-19 and a no deal Brexit represent key concurrent challenges facing the Irish economy, the interrelationship of the two economic shocks is an important consideration for Ireland&rsquo;s short-term economic prospects. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department has, along with the ESRI, conducted an analysis of the sectoral overlap of the COVID-19 and no deal Brexit shocks. The main finding of the analysis is that the overlap of the sectors exposed to the different shocks is found to be limited. The sectors most exposed to both the COVID-19 and no deal Brexit shocks appear to be distinct and relatively unconnected. Having assessed the impact of no deal Brexit and COVID-19 on 57 sectors of the economy, no sector was found to be severely exposed to both shocks. The research also examines interlinkages between the exposed sectors in terms of domestic supply chains. It found that sectors that are severely affected by COVID-19 typically sell a greater share of their output to sectors that are likely to be relatively unaffected by Brexit and vice versa. This implies relatively limited exposure of producers to their customers experiencing one of the shocks while they experience the other shock. Overall, the analysis suggests that while a combined shock from a no deal Brexit and COVID-19 results in a wider range of sectors exposed to risk, the impacts of each shock to the overall economy are not magnified by spill-overs between the two effects. However, it is important to note that as the analysis was conducted at the sectoral level, the impacts may vary at a firm level with some firms possibly facing a double shock from both COVID-19 and a no deal Brexit. Moreover, it is likely that the capacity of businesses and households to manage a second economic shock will be more limited.

There are also three horizontal priorities which apply across the four pillars:\u00a0regionalisation,\u00a0sustainable finance, and\u00a0workplace diversity.\u00a0 The vision of this strategy is for Ireland to be a top-tier location of choice for specialist international financial services and to enhance and protect our future competitiveness. The employment target for the Strategy is to reach 50,000 people in direct employment in the sector by 2025. According to the enterprise agencies, at the end of 2019, approximately 47,000 jobs are in international financial services, this is an increase of approximately 11,500 net new jobs in the five years since 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Ireland for Finance strategy is the successor to the IFS2020 strategy and a succession of Government strategies for the development of the international financial services strategy in Ireland.\u00a0 It is important to note that the IFS2020 Strategy had been in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU.

This involved virtual bilateral engagements with companies, as well as virtual group meetings to share experiences around working safely and effectively during the pandemic and to discuss best practice with regard to returning to the office.

For example, amongst other things, the Act\u00a0obliges insurers to engage meaningfully with consumers when a claim has been submitted; places a limit the amount of a claim settlement offer that an insurer can retain until repairs have been completed, and\u00a0restricts the circumstances in which insurers can repudiate the contract on materially unrelated grounds.<\/p>  <p>While the majority of the Act is now law, I have made the decision that sections 8, 9, 12, 14(1)-(5) will come into effect on the 1st   September 2021. It is important to note that significant systems changes are required by the industry before the related provisions could go live. Accordingly, the sections being commenced next year broadly relate to insurers' obligations to provide more detailed information when signing consumers up to a contract (Section 8), and providing greater consumer transparency about their\u00a0 claim and premium\u00a0history at renewal (Section 12). Section 9 and 14(1)-(5) are intrinsically linked to the information requirements set out in section 8 and therefore also require a longer commencement period. All of these significant new contract and renewal requirements will require insurers to upgrade their systems, which require time to implement because of the technical nature and scale of what will be required.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, I will consider the commencement of Section 18 when a specific technical legal point has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion my decision to implement the Act in this manner is based on my considered\u00a0 judgement which recognises the significant impact some aspects of this Act has on insurers&rsquo; operations, whilst at the same time proceeding with the wider reforms this Act provides. This I believe is the most appropriate way forward for industry and consumers alike in these circumstances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900078#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":730,"content":"<p>Question No. 314 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900078#WRO02300"},{"type":"question","counter":732,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[27358\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900078#WRO02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value of funds expected to be drawn down by Ireland in 2021 from the Brexit adjustment reserve announced as part of the EU multi-annual financial framework; the way in which it will be allocated across sectors and measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":733,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, on 21<sup>st<\/sup>July 2020, Heads of State and Government reached agreement on the Post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Next Generation EU, totalling &euro;1.82 trillion.

A Public Exhibition of the preferred scheme is now expected to take place later this year.\u00a0 This will give the community an opportunity to examine and provide formal comments and observations over a four-week period. <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, Cork County Council has been approved funding under the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection scheme an additional &euro;187,248 in October 2018 for the provision of temporary flood defence measures including a sand bag defence structure, two non-return valves at existing drainage outfalls and pumping sumps to allow over pumping during flood events.

A General Government surplus of 0.4% of GDP was recorded in 2019, a balanced budget in structural terms was delivered, and debt to GDP ratio of 59%.<\/p>  <p>  From an expenditure perspective the initial response to the Covid-19 crisis was swift, with emergency measures introduced to support and protect households and enterprises. In total, it is estimated that additional Covid-19 related expenditure supports of approximately &euro;16 billion are to be provided this year,\u00a0a significant investment that equates to 9% of GNI*. These additional expenditures would bring gross voted expenditure for 2020 to over &euro;86 billion, an increase of over &euro;19 billion or almost 30% relative to last year.<\/p>  <p>  In July, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved\u00a0additional Covid-19 health expenditure in the Health\u00a0Revised Estimate. This\u00a0Estimate\u00a0included a &euro;2 billion increase relative to the Health allocation set out in the REV published in December last year. Further resources have also been recently agreed by Government in relation to the 2020\/2021 Winter Initiative and officials in my Department are actively engaging with their counterparts in the Department of Health and the HSE on the scale of additional funding that will be required\u00a0over the rest of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The labour market has borne a significant brunt of the impact of the crisis so far. In light of this, the Government has taken significant steps to cushion, where possible, the impact on households and businesses.\u00a0Taking into account expenditure on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Wage Subsidy Scheme,\u00a0Social Protection expenditure will be over &euro;30 billion this year, an increase of over &euro;9 billion relative to REV 2020.\u00a0In addition &euro;1 &frac12; billion of Exchequer funding\u00a0has been made available for liquidity measures, restart grants and commercial rates waivers to support business. Further to this, additional resources have also been made available to support the significant efforts undertaken to ensure the safe reopening of our Education systems.<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the overall Budgetary Strategy for 2021 will focus on prioritising crisis management measures to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit while preserving and maintaining existing levels of service within core expenditure programmes. Work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021 and further details will be set out\u00a0in the 2021 Expenditure Report. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will need to continue to run a deficit next year to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit. The State will borrow to cover this deficit. We are in a position to\u00a0borrow this money because of the actions of the European Central Bank and the credibility of our public finances. Taking a longer-term view, it is important that,\u00a0as the economy returns to growth and employment is restored,\u00a0the deficit is reduced year-on-year to underpin the sustainability of the public finances and to ensure the funding for our key public services. <\/p>  <p>  In support of this process, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process and proposes that each Minister will be required to produce service improvement and reform plans in conjunction with my Department, within an overall context of an enhanced focus across Government on issues of well-being.\u00a0 In implementing this reform, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.<\/p>  <p>  Adopting this approach will ensure stronger dialogue in this House on key elements of budgetary policy and will help to facilitate the continued development of budgetary decisions, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900079#WRP04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900079#WRP04400"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[27257\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900079#WRP04500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which he expects to be in a position to meet in full the expenditure anticipated in 2020 and subsequent years in the National Capital Programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>I expect to be in a position to meet in full the expenditure anticipated in 2020 and subsequent years in the Public Capital Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The gross voted capital allocations for 2020 were set out in the Revised Estimates Volume, published in December 2019, the allocations amounting to almost &euro;8.2 billion represented a 15% increase over the 2019 outturn and was deemed sufficient, at that time, to meet Department&rsquo;s commitments for 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the jobs stimulus plan announced in July contained a &euro;500 million package for accelerated capital works and other capital supports across a range of areas in support of employment-intensive economic activity in 2020, &euro;100 million of which\u00a0will be drawn down in 2021.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, this Government has increased the overall 2020 capital expenditure allocations by an additional &euro;1.5 billion, bringing total capital investment in 2020 to above &euro;9.7 billion.\u00a0 This is the highest ever investment in capital projects and programmes in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Government is committed to delivering capital expenditure levels of &euro;9.1 billion for 2021.\u00a0 This is almost &euro;1 billion or 12% higher than the original sum budgeted for 2020. \u00a0The precise configuration and prioritisation of the overall 2021 capital allocation, including the remaining unallocated reserve, will be specified further and more comprehensively in the context of Budget 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with Programme for Government commitments and in my capacity as\u00a0Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform I recently brought proposals to the Government regarding the launch of a structured, in-depth review of the National Development Plan (NDP) in order to advance the priorities identified in the Programme for Government including climate change, housing policy, transport policy, implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and balanced regional development, aligned also with the associated multi-annual resourcing requirements.

This was the report on the outcome of a wide-ranging review of fire services in Ireland which was undertaken in 2011\/2012, and was endorsed as national policy in early 2013. It concluded that local authorities were best positioned to continue to provide fire services in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  However, fire authorities do cooperate with each other as and when required and on a regular basis on a number of matters. For example, they are enabled by the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003\u00a0to assist each other and provide support on a &lsquo;mutual-assistance&rsquo; basis, and this is the expected norm for fire services. The Chief Fire Officer for the area where a large scale incident is located will typically engage neighbouring services when required, on the basis of agreed pre-planned arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  At national level, a National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was created within\u00a0my Department in 2009 to give central direction and leadership for the fire and emergency management services. The 2009 arrangements put in place a management structure at central government level with a clear mandate and visibility to develop national policy and to drive consistent achievement of quality fire services by local authorities. Under the system, responsibility for the day-to-day operation of fire services remains with the local authorities. However, the National Directorate&rsquo;s mandate includes developing national policies and national standards, and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.<\/p>  <p>  The NDFEM administers the Fire Services Central Training Programme supplements training arranged by fire authorities. It represents an efficient service delivery model by offering train-the-trainer courses on a regional basis, therefore ensuring consistency of approach throughout the service.<\/p>  <p>  The KCS policy document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire and, for the first time, set out national norms, standards and targets against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014\/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of KCS. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The report concluded that current arrangements, as outlined, are working effectively to meet the challenges involved in trying to protect communities from fire and other emergencies. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the following link: <\/p>  <p>  http:\/\/www.housing.gov.ie\/local-government\/fire-and-emergency-management\/fire-services-ireland-local-delivery-national.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the current COVID situation has understandably delayed a new (second) EVG process.

It is a relief that there were no deaths or injuries, but the very sudden displacement of thousands of people, including children, has caused great suffering and created a major humanitarian emergency as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the COVID pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart on 9 September immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities have requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from our humanitarian logistics base in Brindisi, Italy. The Greek authorities have thanked us for our offer of assistance and we now stand ready to respond to a request for the deployment of emergency humanitarian supplies.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. The migration crisis continues to be one of the major challenges confronting the European Union and it needs to be urgently addressed. We must find more sustainable solutions involving consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with our EU partners to resolve these issues and to ensure that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met. <\/p>  <p>  On 23 September 2020, the Commission published a major new proposal on reforming the EU migration and asylum system - a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;- and has also established a dedicated Taskforce to resolve the emergency situation on Lesvos effectively and humanely. I welcome both initiatives by the Commission. The publication of the Migration Pact proposals represents an opportunity to renew and intensify efforts to agree a common approach and put in place more effective and humane arrangements to manage the considerable migratory pressures that Europe continues to face. <\/p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. We have also committed to accept 36 unaccompanied minors in need of international protection in Greece, and I was pleased that the first group of eight such minors arrived in Ireland last June. In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided to accept another group of four unaccompanied minors, as part of this overall commitment, and is continuing to keep under review what further actions it can take to meet the enormous humanitarian and relocation needs arising from this tragic event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900083#WRT02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":1033,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900083#WRT02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1034,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[27026\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900083#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount of overseas aid paid by Ireland to Mozambique annually; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1035,"content":"<p>Mozambique is among the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, ranked 180<sup>th<\/sup>of 189 countries in the 2019 United Nations Human Development Index.

Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools and it is my intention to make progress on this in future budgets.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year. This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system.<\/p>  <p>  The main capitation grant used for general running costs of schools has also increased in each of the last two budgets.  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased the combined increases given in Budgets 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration has been achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The financial package approved by Government to support schools recognises that COVID-19 poses significant challenges. The Government published the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, along with details of a financial package of over &euro;375 million to support the implementation of the measures in the roadmap which included &euro;10.2m in additional funding to support Principals and Deputy Principals who also undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding will provide each teaching principal with one release day per week, and release days for Deputy Principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal.<\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants. In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Principal&rsquo;s allowance was increased to its pre-FEMPI rate with effect from 1 October 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration in the context of the next round of pay talks. Regarding the competing demands for the next Budget, I must have regard to the level of resources which will be available to my Department, in the context of the continuing need for the Government to prudently manage the economy and the public finances and have regard to risks, including those associated with the COVID pandemic and Brexit.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900084#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1088,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900084#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1089,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[27039\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900084#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the safety measures being used for school children on school buses (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1090,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

All children using school transport scheme services are being asked to comply with the a number of guidelines, including not  to use school transport if they are displaying obvious symptoms, to maintain physical distancing while waiting for transport, to always sit in their pre-assigned seating, to use hand sanitiser prior to or on boarding the bus,  to observe respiratory etiquette at all times  and that all children on post-primary transport are required to wear facemasks while waiting for and on-board transport services (with the exception of children who for medical or special educational needs reasons are not in a position to wear a facemask or face covering). <\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has and continues to engage with their own drivers and with private contractors who are contracted to provide school transport services in regard to sanitisation and additional cleaning requirements on school transport services. <\/p>  <p>  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.

Assisted by Department funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  <\/p><p>My Department provided schools with a series of <i>Continuity of Schooling Guidance<\/i>&rdquo; documents to help education professionals and parents to support children learning in a remote environment.  They included links to a range of materials developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (a Department support service for teachers) such as learning platforms and online tools which can be used to support remote\/distance teaching and learning. Those resources continue to be available to schools. There is also ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to the safe return to school in the context of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic, which is an evolving situation. All guidance documents are under review and will be updated to take account of the current situation and to support schools further in maintaining continuity of schooling for all learners including those at very high risk and unable to return to school at this time. <\/p><p>As a contingency for any future school closures, whether localised or at a bigger scale, and to ensure compliance with any public health restrictions, it is essential however that all schools are prepared and have in place appropriate measures to continue to deliver teaching and learning whether for closure of a class group or the school. In this regard, my Department is in the process of drafting a circular that will issue to schools to help in their preparation for such an event. The circular will provide guidance and support to schools, building on the work already done by schools, to put in place appropriate arrangements to facilitate communication with and between staff, between staff and learners and to facilitate development of online approaches to remote and blended learning in the event that such is required. My Department will engage with education stakeholders, including unions and management bodies, to inform the final drafting of the circular.  <\/p><p>A commitment of &euro;210m was provided under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 for improved ICT infrastructure, of which &euro;160m has issued to schools to date, including &euro;50m which issued earlier this year. In the context of the current public health crisis schools can use this funding to address ICT needs including devices, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning. This may include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with learners who do not have access to devices and for the purchase of essential learning platforms. The remaining &euro;50m under this provision will issue to schools during the current school year (2020-2021) subject to the availability of exchequer funding.  Separately, and through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, my Department provides for improved ICT infrastructure for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools and some 98% of schools avail of this service. All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the High Speed Broadband programme. Schools in this programme are monitored and selected for upgrade where usage signals this requirement. The primary broadband scheme is based on locally available infrastructure accessed by the providers of the service to my Department.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.<\/p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. <\/p>  <p>  We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.<\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process for calculated grade system the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.  <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades which relies on the uniform application of the statistical model.  <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.  <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900084#WRU04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1109,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[26351\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900084#WRU04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the start date in November 2020 for the repeat of the 2020 leaving certificate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1110,"content":"<p>On 26 August, I announced that the postponed Leaving Certificate examinations would commence on Monday 16 November, subject to public health advice. <\/p><p>On 25 September, it was announced the registration for these postponed examinations would open on Monday 28 September.

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous.  This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards.  The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally.  This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic.  For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%.  Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded on 7th September 2020, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades were either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades were lower. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible.  The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.  The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.<\/p>  <p>  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual's Calculated Grades.  Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time. <\/p>  <p>  The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level.  The Junior Cycle data for 2020 Leaving Certificate students who had sat their examinations in another school were carried in to the school at which they were registered to sit the Leaving Certificate.  <\/p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.  It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1143,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[26500\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to ongoing issues at a school (details supplied) directly related to increased space requirements due to Covid-19.","asker":"1626","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1144,"content":"<p>A building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department's Construction Programme which is being delivered under the National Development Plan.  <\/p><p>This project is one of the school building projects on my Department's ADAPT 2 (Accelerated Delivery of Architectural Planning &amp;amp; Tendering) Programme and is currently going through the Architectural planning process.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department's Planning and Building are currently liaising with the school authorities to address any accommodation issues that have arising as a result of the Covid 19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1145,"content":"<p>Question No. 458 answered with Question No. 436.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[26506\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) is still awaiting the reinstatement of the &euro;5,000 additional ancillary grant that was expected in June 2020; when the school can expect to receive the grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>On foot of\u00a0a Chairman's Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015.

The timeframe for this will vary from route to route and may take a number of weeks to complete. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":1164,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1165,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[26609\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900085#WRV04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the new 2021 post-primary school patron selections; if the online patronage preference system will open for these schools in September 2020, as stated in Parliamentary Question No. 180 of 20 May 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1166,"content":"<p>In light of the Covid-19 situation, the patronage process for the 2021 post-primary schools including that for Ballincollig was deferred.\u00a0 The Summer months and September in particular were critical in terms of school communities' preparation and implementation of arrangements to reopen schools.

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, <\/i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. <\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education <\/i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. <\/i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i><\/i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. <\/p><p>The www.gov.ie\/backtoschool site also contains information on well-being supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing well-being, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  <\/p><p>Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900086#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1183,"content":"<p>Question No. 471 answered with Question No. 439.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":1184,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900086#WRW00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1185,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[26760\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900086#WRW00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the review of RSE in schools has been completed; and when the changes will be introduced in schools.","asker":"1549","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1186,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) conducted a thorough and transparent review, and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019.

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.   It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded on 7th September 2020, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades were either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades were lower. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.   The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.<\/p>  <p>  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time. <\/p>  <p>  The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level.  The Junior Cycle data for 2020 Leaving Certificate students who had sat their examinations in another school were carried in to the school at which they were registered to sit the Leaving Certificate.  <\/p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900086#WRW03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers","counter":1218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900086#WRW04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[27050\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900086#WRW04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a schedule of advisers and special advisers appointed and or recruited by her since her appointment will be provided; the roles and responsibilities attributed to each; and the salary for each appointee in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1220,"content":"<p>The following tabular statement gives details of the Special Advisers I have appointed to assist me in carrying out my ministerial duties.

Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools. Such supports include:<\/p>  <p>  - Investment of some &euro;125 million in my Department's DEIS Programme for educational inclusion providing for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS.  Traveller pupils are included for the purposes of determining the level of mainstream teaching staff in the relevant DEIS schools.<\/p>  <p>  - A new model for allocating Special Education Teachers introduced for mainstream schools  which provides a single allocation for special educational supports to teaching needs for schools, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. The model establishes a school&rsquo;s educational profile, which includes traveller children, enrolled in a school under the following strands: <\/p>  <p>  - The number of students with complex special educational needs<\/p>  <p>  - The social context of school which includes gender, primary school location and educational disadvantage. For primary schools, the social context survey asked schools to the number of pupils from a Traveller family as one component of the social context survey. For post primary schools, social context was based on the number of pupils who had exam fee exemptions, including Traveller pupils.<\/p>  <p>  - Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results. This includes schools with pupils from the Traveller and Roma community who may be attaining lower standardised test scores. The allocation is based on the learning need evidenced by the test score result as opposed to by the cultural identifier in accordance with mainstream policy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department currently spends approximately &euro;1.9 billion or almost 20% of its total educational budget annually on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. This represents an increase of over 50% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 billion per annum was provided.   Enhanced pupil capitation is also paid for Traveller pupils.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to improving educational outcomes for Traveller and Roma learners at all levels, through the implementation of the education actions of NTRIS. Responding to specific actions in the NTRIS and the DEIS Plan, a Two Year Pilot Programme to target attendance, participation and retention\/school completion has been established in four specific Traveller and Roma Communities. Partners in the project include Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), Department of Education and Skills, Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and Traveller and Roma representatives. Each pilot area is being provided with  an additional Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) and  Home School Liaison Coordinator (HSCL) and two additional Traveller\/Roma Education Workers.

F&Aacute;S was not a party to the LRC case.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, the issue of CE Supervisor pension provision was considered by a Community Sector High Level Group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. <\/p>  <p>  In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of the many thousands of workers in the broader sector.  DPER stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.<\/p>  <p>  At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes all over the country.  We simply could not sustain a lot of our local community services without their work.  CE provides a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  The current position is that officials from my Department, DPER and the Unions are in ongoing discussions on the matter and I would therefore ask the Deputies to respect the confidentiality of the process and to allow those talks to continue free from speculation that may not assist the process at the present time.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic context in which any such scheme will need to operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900088#WRY04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":1336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900088#WRY04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1337,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[26929\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900088#WRY05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if inquiries will be made in the case of a taxi driver (details supplied) who was placed on a lower pandemic unemployment payment despite having an average income of over &euro;450 per week due to treatment of capital allowances by the Revenue Commissioners; if her attention has been drawn to the number of taxi drivers similarly affected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1338,"content":"<p>As part of the July Jobs Stimulus package the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was extended by 7 months to the end of March 2021. \u00a0This extension continues the support for people who have lost employment due to the pandemic.

This Government acknowledges the important role that carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. Officials in my Department will be examining the policy options for reforming the state pension system both in this area, and more generally in relation to considerations around a Total Contributions Approach.<\/p>  <p>  The public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.\u00a0 That is why the Programme for Government also commits to the establishment of a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.\u00a0\u00a0The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.\u00a0 I will bring proposals in that regard to Government as soon as possible.\u00a0 Once it has concluded its deliberations, the\u00a0Commission will report to Government by June of next year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the current situation is that through the award of credited contributions, normally known as credits, the social insurance system gives significant recognition to time spent caring in terms of qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0 Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.\u00a0 In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.\u00a0 Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.\u00a0 Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.\u00a0 Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the Homemaker scheme.\u00a0 The scheme, which was introduced in and from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0 Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the State Pension (Contributory) rate of payment when the rate of pension is calculating using the Yearly Average method.<\/p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as T12) was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.\u00a0 It, for the first time, acknowledged home caring periods prior to 1994 and provides for up to 20 years of\u00a0home caring periods to be considered.\u00a0\u00a0Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits \/ homecaring periods,\u00a0qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.\u00a0Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases\u00a0resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.<\/p>  <p>  Since April 2019 all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and Interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted if\u00a0a person\u00a0does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0 Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for

2025.\u00a0 In addition, my Department monitors independent research on areas of interest and commissions research where required. <\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900090#WRAA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900090#WRAA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[26784\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900090#WRAA03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if backdating social insurance coverage to 1973 will be considered for members of religious orders who were excluded prior to the introduction of social welfare regulations in 1988.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>Between 1974 and 1988 a number of legislative changes were introduced to extend social insurance coverage to members of religious orders.<\/p>  <p>  In 1974,\u00a0a provision to allow religious congregations to apply to the Minister for Social Welfare for access to social insurance for their members was introduced.\u00a0 While all religious authorities had the opportunity to apply, only the Church of Ireland\u00a0congregation\u00a0made the necessary written representations to the Minister for access to social insurance for its members and in\u00a01975, Church of Ireland ministers of religion became insurable as employees for social insurance purposes, in respect of their pastoral employment. <\/p>  <p>  In 1985, there was a further change to the insurability of certain members of religious orders.\u00a0 A\u00a0provision was introduced to allow ministers of religion engaged in secular (non-pastoral) employments to access social insurance provided the appropriate authority, acting on behalf of its members, made representations to the Minister for such access.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Fundamental changes were made to\u00a0the social insurance system in 1988.\u00a0 Ministers of religion who were in employment became insurable in the same way as other employed persons while those who were not in an employment but had income were brought\u00a0 into social insurance cover as self-employed contributors. <\/p>  <p>  As the arrangements introduced from 1974\u00a0offered an opportunity for bodies acting on behalf of ministers of religion who were in employment to access social insurance cover\u00a0and as in 1988 self-employed ministers of religion were brought into compulsory social insurance cover with all other self-employed persons and those who were employed became compulsorily insured as employees, it is not possible to disturb the arrangements for such persons at this stage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900090#WRAA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900090#WRAA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[26837\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900090#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a pension will be reviewed for a person (details supplied);

The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.  I have met with employee and employer representatives on a number of occasions and have listened to their concerns.  I will consider any proposals which seek to resolve the difficulties faced by the sector, including the proposals for Budget 2021 shared with me by the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are significant challenges associated with implementing the proposals put forward in the SIPTU Big Start Campaign, including the current economic context in which Budget 2021 is being prepared.  In particular, as the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff. <\/p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector in the context of the wide range of policy ambitions of Government and likely budget constraints from 2021 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare.  Additional investment of &euro;63.6m brought spending to &euro;638m in 2020, a 141% increase in investment over five budgets.  This increase has included specific measures to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands, such as: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, whilst this welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  Work continues to progress the Workforce Development Plan, which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p>  <p>  I launched an extensive consultation with the sector on the Workforce Development Plan on 19 August.  The consultation process includes a call for submissions\/survey which is available to anyone who wishes to provide feedback.  On 22 September, I addressed an online information webinar on the consultation process, which was very well attended.  This event provided an update to the sector on the consultation process and how those working in the sector can take part.<\/p>  <p>  Delivering on a further commitment in First 5, an expert group has been appointed to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services.  The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care systems, funding and quality, economics, and policy experts from a number of Government Departments.  A public consultation process on the development of a new funding model is taking place in parallel to the public consultation on the Workforce Development Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900092#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":1533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900092#WRCC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1534,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[26633\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900092#WRCC02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason Ireland has only allowed a minimal number of children in from the Moria refugee camp; and his plans to allow more children into Ireland.","asker":"1625","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1535,"content":"<p>Thank you for your question on this pressing matter.<\/p><p>I am extremely concerned with the plight of the refugees in Moria following the fires there, especially young people who are without parents or family in the camp.

In response to such situations, a number of policy and legislative improvements have been made to child protection standards over recent years. In particular, the Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children.<\/p>  <p>  The Act places an obligation on these organisations to keep children safe from harm, to carry out a risk assessment and to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement (CSS) that outlines the policies and procedures that are in place to manage any risks identified. The Act also provides for Tusla to establish and maintain a register of non-compliance for organisations who fail to provide a copy of the CSS to Tusla when requested to do so.

The Commission is due to submit its final report to me next month and its remit includes investigating the entry and exit pathways for mothers and their children through certain Mother and Baby Homes. As Minister, I cannot pre-empt the findings of the Commission and I do not intend to make any public statement on historic adoption issues in advance of the final report. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of illegal birth registrations, the Commission's second interim report recognised that these individuals have a need to establish their identity, but also acknowledged that the false registration of births is a very difficult issue to investigate because of a lack of accurate records. The Deputy will be aware that in the case of St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild, detailed records were kept and 151 cases of illegal birth registrations were identified by Tusla.  The process of contacting and then supporting those affected by the illegal birth registrations uncovered on those files is reaching completion, and is being handled very carefully, on a case by case basis, and at the pace of the individual concerned.  Tusla social workers are supporting the individuals affected as they deal with the news of their illegal birth registration and have put in place a dedicated counselling service.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of information and tracing in the context of adoption, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 has lapsed and I am currently considering the complex matters involved before deciding on how best to legislate in this important area.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it is acknowledged by all parties that adoption in the past was often a secretive process, carried out sometimes without due regard to the rights and interests of those involved, and to the lifelong impact on those individuals. However, adoption today is a service for children, to provide a family to care for them when their parents are unable to do so, and where adoption is in their best interests. <\/p>  <p>  Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. Modern day adoption legislation and practice also ensures that the rights of all involved are vindicated, including birth fathers, within the overarching framework of working for the best interests of the child involved. <\/p>  <p>  I expect to be in a position to comment in more detail on the issues raised by the Deputy, in the context of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation's final report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900093#WRDD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1624,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[26921\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900093#WRDD05700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if an apology will be issued for the incarceration of women and children in mother and baby homes and similar institutions.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1625,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[26922\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900093#WRDD05800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if an apology will be issued to mothers and relatives whose children died in institutions due to abuse and neglect.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1626,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[26924\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900093#WRDD05900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if an apology will be issued for the policies and practices that caused mothers and children to be separated from each other by forcing and coercing women into relinquishing their babies.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1627,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[26927\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900093#WRDD06000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if an apology will be issued to mothers who were denied knowledge of their rights, which prevented them from giving informed consent.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1628,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 628, 629, 631 and 634 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes was established by Government to investigate the significant concerns related to the institutional care of unmarried mothers and their babies during the period 1922 to 1998.

There is no official data on the extent of such shortages. However, officials in my Department have been actively monitoring the issue and have sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives on the Covid Advisory Group on Reopening, which has been meeting regularly over recent months. The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is available to the early learning and childcare sector, with a full exemption to the turnover rule, to assist them with staffing costs.<\/p><p>I am committed to supporting providers in responding to current challenges. In designing responses, it is important that any measures considered are proportionate to the problem they seek to address and that wider impacts would be carefully considered. In that regard, it is important to stress that the minimum qualification requirement to work directly with children in an early learning care service (Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications) was introduced in 2016 in order to improve the quality of provision and to achieve better outcomes for children. (There is currently no minimum qualification requirement for staff working in school-age childcare.) To remove this minimum qualification requirement could be contrary to the best interests of children and the vision for the sector that is outlined in <i>First 5<\/i>, the whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families. Such a move could be a significant backwards step in efforts to improve quality outcomes for children and could only be considered if there were a very strong evidence base requiring a change. <\/p><p>Staffing and recruitment difficulties are being caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of turnover and attrition. This is predominantly down to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example, the average pay being &euro;12.55 per hour, and half of staff only being able to access part-time contracts. It is expected that poor terms and conditions will be addressed in the medium to long term via three plans currently being pursued by Government: a new funding model, a workforce development plan and additional investment. Short-term measures are more challenging to find and, as stated above, the Department continues to work intensively with sectoral representatives to examine what might be possible. One potential solution that has been proposed by the sector is being given active attention at the moment by the Department of Education and Skills and my Department.<\/p><p>With reference to the example suggested by the Deputy of allowing retired teachers to work in the sector, individuals who hold qualifications to teach in primary schools have previously been approved by my Department to work in early learning and care services, and my Department&rsquo;s list of recognised qualifications includes a number of teaching qualifications. In reality this is not likely to be a major source of staff due to the sectoral terms and conditions referred to above. The list of qualifications eligible to work in the sector can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website. Any individual who holds a qualification not on this list may apply to my Department for recognition of their qualifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[27126\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he has had regard to correspondence from a person (details supplied) in relation to the childcare sector.","asker":"1514","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy has been received by my Department and a response will issue shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1645,"qnumday":639,"qnumall":"[27308\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the independently appointed Collaborative Forum of Former Residents of Mother and Baby Homes specifically and repeatedly recommended to his Department that the task of managing information and tracing be removed from Tusla on the basis that they experienced the behaviour of the agency to be demoralising and frustrating and damaging and retraumatising (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1646,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[27316\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a group (details supplied) proposed amendments to the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 and several Senators submitted amendments at Seanad Committee Stage that would provide all adopted persons with their birth certificate following an information session as a proportionate measure to respect the rights of all concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1647,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[27320\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900094#WREE02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on whether the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 made no provision for natural mothers to access their own personal data; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1648,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 639, 647 and 651 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 has lapsed and I am currently considering the complex matters involved before deciding on how best to legislate in this important area.

While adoption today is a child focused service, aimed at providing a family for a child where their own parents are unable to care for them, in the past, the focus of adoption was often on the needs of adults. This includes both adoptive parents, who may have been stigmatised as unable to have children, and also unmarried parents, in particular unmarried mothers of so-called &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; children.<\/p><p>In the development of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, my Department received submissions from multiple stakeholders, including natural or birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted people.<\/p><p>My Department has also had engagement with social workers who have years of experience working with natural mothers. These social workers have conveyed to the Department the serious concerns which some natural mothers have about the potential release of their information. In particular, they have indicated that, at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth and placement for adoption, these birth mothers understood that their details would never be released. Some such birth mothers have spoken of how they were promised no contact would ever be made. It must be remembered that this happened in the context of secrecy around the adoption process in the past, and in a social climate where to be an unmarried mother was seen as shameful.<\/p><p>Many of these natural mothers were encouraged to keep the fact that they had placed a child for adoption secret, and have never told anyone, including their subsequent spouses and children. Consequently, the prospect of the release of their information makes them extremely fearful for the future of their relationships with their families, spouses, children, and wider community. It must also be remembered that many of these natural mothers are now at an advanced age, or are vulnerable for other reasons, including as survivors of incest and rape. <\/p><p>While there are many birth mothers who are happy to share their personal information with their children, it is clear this is not the case for all of them. <\/p><p>The advice received from the Attorney General in the development of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 was clear: there must be some protection of birth parents' constitutional right to privacy reflected in the legislation.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be necessary through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021.

In its ruling, the Court underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 Directive and concluded that Member States were not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the Directive. Those grounds are now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has previously advised my Department that prohibiting or providing for an offence for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child for the purposes of advertising, direct marketing or profiling, appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to member states in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read in conjunction with Recital (47).\u00a0 Put simply, it is not an option for a member state to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Any measure such as the one proposed by the Deputy would give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and would expose the State to sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission have confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR does not exclude processing for such purposes in relation to a child, but stresses the importance of balancing the legitimate interest of the controller with the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. The reference to a child in Article 6(1)(f) and recital (47) underlines that such assessments must be performed with particular care where personal data of a child is processed. The Commission has pointed out that the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing is therefore not as such unlawful. They have also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, in June of this year, the European Commission published its first evaluation and review of the GDPR pursuant to Article 97 GDPR. \u00a0In its report, the Commission did not recommend any substantive amendments to the Regulation, but did commit to providing tools to clarify \/ support the application of data protection rules to children.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Commission recommended that the European Data Protection Board adopt guidelines which are practical, easily understandable, and which provide clear answers and avoid ambiguities on issues related to the application of the GDPR, particularly in relation to the processing of children&rsquo;s data.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the GDPR is an EU wide instrument agreed by all the member states of the European Union and one State cannot unilaterally change it, nor can we deviate from its provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900099#WRKK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Policing","counter":1936,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900099#WRKK04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1937,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[27301\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900099#WRKK04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason funding for the community policing forum in the northinner city ceased in May 2019.","asker":"1560","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1938,"content":"<p>I understand that a Community Policing Forum (CPF) operated in the north inner city between 1999 and 2019, and that the Forum was funded through the Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force, but that that funding ceased in May 2019.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Health has overall responsibility for the Local Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. <\/p>  <p>  A core element of the CPF operating model was that the community should have a role in identifying relevant issues and that an inter-agency approach should be adopted in resolving such issues. <\/p>  <p>  The recent Covid-19 crisis has shown how proactive and collaborative community engagement by community services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can improve the condition of peoples&rsquo; lives.\u00a0 For example, since the onset of the Covid-19 restrictions, Garda&iacute; attached to Store Street Garda Station have increased engagement with the more vulnerable members of society in the North East Inner City area of Dublin, through volunteer services, service providers and on an individual basis.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Building on the experience of the CPF, and as part of the implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, my Department is devising a policy on a whole-of-Government approach to community safety which aims to help foster local communities that are safer for families, residents and businesses and that feel more secure. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the policy, plans are being advanced to develop a North Inner City Community Safety Pilot which would encompass the North Inner City Electoral Area.

Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. <\/p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions in maternity hospitals\/units and this issued to all maternity services last week. The paper seeks to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.   Each maternity service\/network has been requested to review visiting arrangements on a weekly basis, in the context of the issues and factors identified in the paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900100#WRLL05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2006,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900100#WRLL05900"},{"type":"question","counter":2007,"qnumday":765,"qnumall":"[26294\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900100#WRLL06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of additional ICU beds that have been provided since March 2020 nationally and in Naas General Hospital, respectively; the number of new hospital consultants appointed since March 2020 nationally and in Naas General Hospital, respectively; the equivalent figures in relation to additional ICU beds and new consultants planned to the end of 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2008,"content":"<p>At the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit.

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.<\/p>  <p>  Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, organised indoor and outdoor gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services.<\/p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputies can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. <\/p>  <p>  Further information on the public health measures currently in place under the different Levels can be found at \u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/campaigns\/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900101#WRMM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2040,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900101#WRMM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2041,"qnumday":775,"qnumall":"[26328\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900101#WRMM01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2042,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year.

I would also wish to underline the acute awareness of the Government of the important role which sporting activities play in communities across Ireland, and the severe impact which the restrictions that we have been living under for much of this year have had, in particular on younger people.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 was published by the Government on 15 September. This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.\u00a0The Plan provides for five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. <\/p><p>Each of the levels\u00a0contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the\u00a0risk of transmission of the virus\u00a0in relation to the anticipated degree of\u00a0risk\u00a0at a given time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which:<\/p><p>-  Are informed by public health understanding of the disease <\/p><p>-  Recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others <\/p><p>During this pandemic, the application of the public health advice measures to suppress the disease transmission is intended to minimise the risks to public health while attempting to strike an appropriate balance in:<\/p><p>-  prioritising some activities over others, including health and social care services, education and other essential needs. <\/p><p>-  protecting work and economic activity, and other key societal interests such as sports and important family gatherings, thereby allowing as much of society and business to continue as &ldquo;normally&rdquo; as possible while continuing to make every effort to suppress the virus. \u00a0<\/p><p>To inform national efforts in response to COVID-19, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has undertaken a significant body of work and developed evidence summaries to answer specific research questions posed by the NPHET. The HIQA evidence summary for the Spread of Covid-19 by children\u00a0was published on 21 August last and\u00a0is available on its website at <i>www.hiqa.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-08\/Evidence-Summary-for-spread-of-Covid-19-by-children-.pdf<\/i>. This document also provides some evidence demonstrating where the spread of Covid-19 has been linked to children's sporting activities. <\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)\u00a0has published guidance to assist with the return to sports activities for children and adolescents which is available at <i>www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/respiratory\/coronavirus\/novelcoronavirus\/guidance\/sportandrecreation\/<\/i>. These recommendations outline both the necessary measures which should be taken prior to the return of children to organised sports, as well as the more general ongoing measures which need to be taken to continue to reduce the risk posed by COVID-19. These measures are aimed at minimising the risk of COVID-19 to children while enabling a\u00a0returning to sports activities.<\/p><p>In general, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. It is\u00a0thereby considered prudent to regard team sports as carrying a higher risk of virus transmission occurring, as opposed to sports which involve less close contact among individuals and where a distance of 2 metres between participants can be maintained. <\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>Further information on the public health measures currently in place under the different Levels can be found at <i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900103#WROO02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":2152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900103#WROO02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2153,"qnumday":820,"qnumall":"[26492\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900103#WROO02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the HSE clinical advisory group report on medical cards will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2154,"content":"<p>The HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to undertake a review regarding the provision of medical cards in cases of terminal illness.

However, organised outdoor gatherings of up to 15 people are still permitted.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important that addiction services take place in a safe environment to safeguard the health of service users and reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 when level 3 restrictions are in place.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of drug and alcohol task forces to discuss the restoration of drug and alcohol services.

Under the Winter Plan, an additional 33,950 diagnostics are proposed in Q4 2020 and an additional 45,267 diagnostics up to April 2021. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900108#WRTT01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":2425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900108#WRTT01500"},{"type":"question","counter":2426,"qnumday":916,"qnumall":"[26971\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900108#WRTT01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will make provision for a primary care centre in Monasterevin, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2427,"content":"<p>As the HSE has responsibility for the provision, along with the maintenance and operation of Primary Care Centres and other Primary Care facilities, the Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900108#WRTT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900108#WRTT01800"},{"type":"question","counter":2429,"qnumday":917,"qnumall":"[26972\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900108#WRTT01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the delivery of the flu vaccine is delayed until 29 September 2020 and that due to quantity issues the number of flu vaccines that can be ordered by general practitioners will be capped; if so, the number that this will be capped at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2430,"content":"<p>Given the potential for the winter flu season in 2020\/2021 to coincide with a resurgence of COVID, and the importance of minimising hospital attendance, the Government is expanding the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the at-risk groups, including healthcare workers, and to all children aged from 2 to 12 years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Vaccines will be administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  The expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access to vaccination without charges.\u00a0By providing vaccination to those most at-risk, and those most likely to require hospitalisation if they contract influenza, it is anticipated that the programme will see a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions,\u00a0as well as a reduction in the overall spread of influenza in the community.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that, following a delay in the delivery of the first batch of vaccines, the first deliveries of influenza vaccines to all sites (GPs, pharmacists, nursing homes etc.) started on 17th September.
