I am glad to be back before the committee today to deal with some of the issues that have arisen in the intervening period and some of the evidence that it has heard from a wide range of experts in the telecommunications, finance and regulatory sector.  We have listened to input over the past weeks which is supportive of the approach taken but also, as one would expect, contrary views.<br\/><br\/>When one looks at the range of interventions, there appears to be support for certain policy objectives.  High-speed broadband should be provided to 100% of premises in the country.  There need to be strong protections for the State, with full transparency of where the State subsidy is being directed.  There must be equal access for all commercial retail providers to the network so that consumers can get the lowest costs and highest levels of service.  We need to provide a future-proofed network to ensure that in the future, a digital divide between urban and rural areas does not re-emerge, and this is reflected in the approach of a predominantly fibre solution proposed by Government, which was supported by ComReg in its evidence.  Prices should be affordable for users, both for connections and products.  These objectives were set out in the strategy approved by Government in December 2015 and signed up to by bidders through the pre-qualification process.<br\/><br\/>There has been commentary to date about the complexity of the process.  It is the scale of the project that brings complexity and not the process itself.  This is an ambitious one-off intervention to bring high-speed broadband to 1.1 million people in 540,000 premises across the country, dispersed among the most geographically and topographically challenging areas.  The competitive dialogue process was chosen as it is designed for processes of this type where it is not possible to fully define tender requirements without extensive engagement with bidders.  The Department&rsquo;s negotiating team met with the bidders on more than 450 occasions culminating in more than 850 hours of dialogue overall.  We left no stone unturned in working with the bidders throughout the process.<br\/><br\/>We have embedded very strict governance into the contract reflecting the requirements of state aid rules, the public spending code, the level of State subsidy involved and the fact that we are dealing with a 25-year contract.  The importance of strong governance to protect the taxpayer&rsquo;s interest was recognised from the outset of the procurement.  Following consultation with stakeholders, including ComReg, the detailed principles of the governance model were set out in the procurement documents and agreed to by the short-listed bidders.  These included access for all bidders to critical infrastructure on equal terms; significant penalties to address underperformance; substantial oversight arrangements to monitor progress, costs and take-up; and substantial clawback provisions on cost savings achieved or to share in future excess profits.  The principles also require a stand-alone board responsible for the ring-fenced operations and routine management of the national broadband plan company, with the board required to report to the Minister regularly.<br\/><br\/>Comments have been made about the capacity of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to deliver the national broadband plan.  NBI has been subject to a rigorous evaluation of its financial and technical capabilities and its proposed solution.  NBI has participated in the process for more than three years and at each point in that process, it has met the Department's detailed assessment criteria, which have been published and in some key areas well exceeded those requirements.  It has the experience and expertise to carry out the work that it has been asked to do and to deliver a project of the size and complexity of the national broadband plan.<br\/><br\/>Insofar as the 300,000 premises with which Eir is involved are concerned, in April 2017 the Department published an updated high-speed broadband map.  This took account of commercial operator plans which had not materialised and new developments since the publication of the original map, notably the commitment agreement signed by Eir with the Department to deploy high-speed broadband to approximately 300,000 premises in rural Ireland.  The Department was obliged to take the Eir proposals into account in accordance with state aid rules and the map and the number of premises in the intervention area was adjusted downwards accordingly.  Evidence from ESB at the committee last week indicates that this decision, unavoidable though it was from a state aid perspective, had a material impact on the commercial viability of the project.<br\/><br\/>The Department notes the detailed contribution of Eir last week where it asserted that high-speed broadband could be provided in the intervention area for &euro;1 billion if it was allowed to deliver it outside what it refers to as the constraints of the national broadband plan procurement process.  In subsequent correspondence with the Department, received last Friday and copied to the committee, it set out a range of &euro;512 million to &euro;1.55 billion of subsidy, with the higher figure referred to as the mid-range scenario, and exclusive of VAT and contingency costs.  In its letter, Eir makes it clear that it is not &quot;a formal offer designed to replace or supersede the current NBP procurement process&quot;.  It could not be as Eir withdrew from the process in 2017.  From a purely legal perspective, the Government could not accept such an offer even if it was made, given procurement and state aid law.  The State cannot simply mandate and fund directly outside a procurement process any economic undertaking to carry out a project of this nature.  We have covered this ground previously when the issue arose about assigning the national broadband plan to ESB.<br\/><br\/>If we had to start a new procurement process for whatever reasons, we estimate that it would take at least three years, considering the requirement to consult on a new strategy, the procurement rules which mandate particular timelines, state aid notification, a new cost-benefit analysis, and an evaluation process.  Further time would be required to mobilise and commence roll-out.  In three years' time, the preferred bidder under the current process would have connected up to 1,000 broadband connection points across all counties and passed more than 200,000 premises with high-quality, high-speed broadband at affordable prices.  There would be no guarantee that a new procurement process would attract bidders and if it did, there could be no certainty as to what the ultimate price would be.  It is certain that whatever form that process took, the resulting contract would still need robust governance and oversight measures of the nature specified in the current contract.<br\/><br\/>The Department welcomes the commitment in the Eir letter to supporting the national broadband plan and the provision of pole and duct products.  When we met representatives of Eir on 28 May, they reaffirmed that to us in a bilateral meeting.  We received the letter last Friday evening.  We have had an opportunity to carry out an assessment of the Eir letter and we are happy to take questions on it from the committee.  I am aware that the committee has received a separate note from Analysys Mason on Eir's overbuild for the 300,000 premises in the course of today.  We submitted an <i>aide-m&eacute;moire<\/i>on the contract provisions.  I apologise for the lateness of my own statement and those supporting documents being submitted to the committee.  We can orally present to the committee this evening if that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin.

We received a letter on Friday evening and have been studying that closely since.  It has been in the possession of the committee for a number of days.  I will recap on a couple of points that I made in my opening statement.  The suggestion in Eir's letter is not a formal proposal.  It suggests that it could deliver broadband in the intervention area for between &euro;512 million and &euro;1.55 billion if it was allowed to deliver it outside what it calls the constraints of the national broadband plan procurement process.  In the letter, it refers to &euro;1.55 billion as its mid-case scenario.  That is somewhat similar to the mid-case scenario that we set out in the national broadband plan documentation which we published, which is approximately &euro;2.1 billion.  The key points that I would draw at a high level from the Eir letter is that it recognises that the national broadband plan is a public policy intervention with societal and political objectives, which is likely to influence the solution chosen.  It is, and we will speak more about that this evening.<\/p><p>It is not making a formal offer to replace the national broadband plan procurement process.  It remains firmly committed to supporting the plan and the provision of poles and duct products for National Broadband Ireland which are very important in the roll-out of the network in the intervention area.  It sets out, in what it calls a hypothetical scenario, how it could deliver high speed broadband in the intervention area if it were asked do so and the estimated cost.  The letter reiterates positions on governance advanced by Eir when participating in the national broadband plan process, how the contract imposes obligations over and above those required by regulations, concerns about the risk of contagion where regulatory equivalents could force Eir to offer what it considers to be more onerous services and prices throughout the country as a whole.  These are issues on which we engaged with Eir in the period leading up to its withdrawal from the process in January 2018.<br\/><br\/>There are a few critical points that are probably worth drawing out and saying a little about.  I will ask colleagues to come in on them.  <br\/><br\/>On governance and what it calls the constraints of complex and onerous provisions, we characterise them as obligations and sound governance mandated by state aid rules and contract law.  They are particularly important when speaking about how we protect &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money.  The system that operates for Eir's 300,000 customers is designed for commercial intervention where a commercial company is spending its own money.  We are speaking about spending &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money.  Therefore, we need a different model with greater oversight.  The <i>aide-memoire<\/i>we sent earlier in the day will be useful in that regard.  I will ask Mr. Mulligan to speak about it.<br\/><br\/>The other thing that came through in evidence last week - it was raised again by Deputies in the discussion with the ESB - was the Eir overbuild.  There are questions about why that approach is being taken by the bidder in terms of whether the infrastructure for Eir's 300,000 customers should be used, what happens if it is done in a particular way, whether additional costs will be incurred and the technology impacts and constraints.  Again, this was the subject of the document received from Analysys Mason this morning, about which I will ask Mr. Neary to speak momentarily.  Another point that is very important and which, in looking at the transcripts, generated a lot of discussion - Deputy Dooley raised this issue in his discussion with ComReg - concerns the nature and cost of connections in the 300,000 customer intervention area, the approach been taken in that regard and what we are doing in the national broadband plan intervention area.  It is important that we tease out the differences and why we are doing it.  I will ask Mr. Mulligan to speak about governance because he has spent the past four of five years of his life in the bowels in dealing with the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>In recent weeks there has been much discussion about the process, in particular, by bidders because they have been involved in it since 2015.  In the end, three bidders spent a huge amount of money, as did we, and four large teams have been involved for long periods.  Our team has involved 50, 60 or 70 people at various times.  Bidders also had large teams, as the committee heard last week from the ESB.  There were large teams in the ESB, Vodafone, SIRO and Eir and the current bidder still has a large team.  The extent of the teams gives an indication of the amount of work required as part of the process since 2015 on the technical, commercial and legal aspects.  Eir, in particular, as the dominant player in Ireland, would probably state it was facing more challenges than others.<\/p> <p>  I will explain the challenge an incumbent operator would have in any such process.  It is not new to Ireland and is the same in every state throughout the world.  When an incumbent is a dominant player in the provision of pole and duct access, in particular, and the passive infrastructure, owns this infrastructure and is regulated, there are strict conditions.  One document that eventually came out of ComReg in the middle of 2018 was on the issue of contagion alluded to last week by Eir.  There was an ongoing discussion, with much correspondence shared between bidders, Eir and the Department since 2017 on the risk of contagion.  The net point about contagion played into the governance process.  <\/p> <p>  I refer the committee to the state aid guidelines which really played into the governance process we had set out.  It is the bible we have had to follow since the get-go in 2015 when we set out the strategy because it had to align with state aid guidelines.  For example, those guidelines state there must be a wholesale open access company; therefore, the strategy had to land on a wholesale open access company.  That wholesale open access company must offer services on equivalent terms.  Again, this is included in the state aid guidelines.  These are common practices in regulation and must be followed.  For incumbents that own infrastructure, there is a particular paragraph in the guidelines, section 78(f).  It states that if an incumbent that owns the infrastructure enters a procurement process, it must allow the other bidders equal access to its infrastructure; otherwise, it cannot tender.  The amount of work and complexity this small paragraph brought into our process was enormous for all bidders that owned infrastructure.  They included the ESB and Enet because they own infrastructure from which other bidders might want to pick and choose.  Because reuse of infrastructure was so critical to reduce the cost to the State, the Department was obliged to put all of the infrastructure into one bucket.  We had to tell anybody who wanted to bid the infrastructure that was available and that they could pick and choose the infrastructure they wanted to use, depending on the network design, in selecting the most cost-effective solution.  All bidders were required to set up an independent ring-fenced team for their infrastructure with Chinese walls.<\/p> <p>  Section 78(f) states any operator that owns or controls infrastructure, irrespective of whether it is actually used in the target area - our intervention area - and that wishes to participate in the tender process should inform the aid granting authority - the Department and the NRA - about the infrastructure during the public consultation process and provide all relevant information - this is a critical point which plays into the Analysys Mason document sent today - for other bidders at a point in time that would allow them to include such infrastructure in their bids.  It also states member states should set up a national database on the availability of existing infrastructures that could be reused in broadband roll-out.  We did all of this.  In our procurement documentation in 2015 we set out the rules that applied to these companies because we were required to do so under state aid rules.  We had to tell the European Commission that we had followed all of them as, otherwise, we would not receive state aid approval.  This added a layer of complexity for any bidder that owned infrastructure.  Clearly, it added a layer of complexity for Eir that others might not have had.  The ESB had it, but it was not regulated in telecoms.<\/p> <p>  While Eir was happy to do this because it was regulated, it spoke about a contagion problem.  We had a level of sympathy for its argument that if we were to do something under this paragraph for bidders in the intervention area such as giving them a discount on a pole price or better terms and conditions, there was a risk that ComReg would make the company do it in Dublin.  We were at pains to say - I have a little bit of experience of regulation - that we were not really sure at what Eir was getting with the contagion argument.  It stated it had a non-discrimination obligation and had to treat everybody equally throughout the country.  That issue was debated to and fro.  I have a letter from January 2017, in which I stated I did not believe it was an issue, that it was imposing the obligation a little too far and that it should talk to ComReg, DG Competition and DG Connect to see whether it was actually true.  Almost a year and a half later, ComReg published an information notice that stated Eir's obligations to act in a non-discriminatory manner meant it was to apply equal conditions in equal circumstances to other undertakings providing equivalent services and information for others under the same conditions and of the same quality as the operator provided its own services or those of its subsidiaries or partners.<\/p><p>That is the obligation that Eircom was interpreting, saying: &quot;If I do something for the national broadband plan company or the bidders in national broadband plan land, I would probably have to apply it to everyone else in the country.&quot;  ComReg published specific information saying that was not true, that obligation did not have to be applied in the national broadband plan world because national broadband plan world is different.  That was after Eircom left the process.  I said this to Eircom officials many times during the process that I thought it was a red herring, and that I did not believe Eircom had a contagion problem, or that ComReg believes it had.  However, as Ms Lennon said in her letter, her legal advisers said that she had and that put them in a difficult position.  I was not acting as her legal adviser and nor was anyone else but it played into the issues and the red lines they were talking about.  The rules of our game, which is in line with state aid guidelines, presented them with a commercial issue for their business.  For example, if the national broadband plan company orders 1.2 million poles from me at &euro;20 a pole, we would think it reasonable to assume there would be a discount at that volume.  Eircom said &quot;No&quot; and that under regulation that was not permissible.  We replied that did not seem appropriate or fair to us in a national broadband plan state aid context.  That took a year and a half to resolve that single point.  Subsequently a discount was given on the 1.2 million poles, which was a substantial sum, in fairness to Eircom.  That is still under review, but that is a regulated product and ComReg still has to conduct reviews of all those poles and ducts and come to a view on those matters.<br\/><br\/>People refer to the complexity of the process, especially in respect of Eircom.  Last week, ESB representatives said they understood the complexity but thought it was fair and in line with the rules of the game.  The current bidder is playing by the rules, has stuck by them and not diverged so far.  Eircom obviously thought the rules were difficult and complex and that it was difficult to stay in the process based on those rules and the constraints, as Mr. Griffin alluded to.  There were constraints but when any incumbent is dominant and that dominance has been placed on it by the regulator, it will face constraints.  <br\/><br\/>Eircom might say it faced constraints under regulation and, therefore, does not need other constraints in the contract.  If I am regulated, I am regulated and those are the rules of the game.  We discussed this a lot with ComReg, which is why the <i>aide-memoire<\/i>we are discussing comes into play.  The complexity and challenge for the bidders is reflected in the contract.  It is 1,500 pages and we have said that we would not give it to the committee yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We appreciate that.

It sticks by procurement law, state aid law and contractual law.  It is a commercial contract, which needs to be commercially enforceable within the Department, through the Commercial Court or whatever.  We are covering every nook and cranny of the contract and making sure on behalf of the State that it is tight.  If, unfortunately, we ever end up in the Commercial Court with any commercial company, it needs to be tight.  It needs to be enforceable and it needs to be possible to penalise companies if they breach the rules of the contract.<br\/><br\/>We need to understand the regulation versus the contract.  In an significant market power, SMP, environment, ComReg hands down obligations on a commercial company.  No state aid is involved.  There is no requirement under regulation for any company to spend any money and there is no requirement on the State to spend any money.  When ComReg hands down regulations it is based on the <i>status quo, <\/i>that Eircom will invest in the 300,000 premises in the knowledge that they would be regulated, but they negotiate the type of regulation with ComReg.The regulation outlined the terms and conditions last October.  If ComReg finds that regulation has been breached and that it is non-compliant, the next stage is the Commercial Court.  It is a very difficult process in regulation and does not cover many of the things in the contract.  Let us take any of the clauses and schedules of our contracts, for example, the deployment schedule.  It is page 13 before one gets to the schedules, which is the body of the requirements.  The clauses are normal contractual clauses that one would find in any typical contract.  When people say that the contract is complicated, the first 13 pages are standard contractual terms that one will find in typical PPPs, such as in the Building Digital UK, BDUK, contract with BT.  Most of what is in those clauses was in the national broadband scheme contract with Three back in the day.  It is a mixture of those which has gone through iterations to be tailored for the NBP process.  <br\/><br\/>I refer to schedule 2.3, No. 97, on page 13.  It refers to deployment requirements, which require the bidder to stick to milestones, quarter by quarter, year by year, for 25 years of what they have to do and when they have to do it.  If they do not do X, Y, and Z, they will not be paid.  That is an example of a part of this contract over which ComReg would have no jurisdiction under regulation.  Schedule 2.5 contains environmental obligations which, again, ComReg would not hand down; they will be dealt with by county councils.  Schedule 2.6 sets out demands on the bidder to set out a communications plan, a demand stimulation plan and a brand plan, over which ComReg would have no jurisdiction.  Schedule 5.2 which is on the next page sets out wholesale prices, benchmarking and product rules.  We benchmark to what ComReg does.  The key point is that ComReg has no role in affordability of pricing to end users - we can discuss connection charges later.  ComReg is there to regulate whatever costs Eircom believe it costs and to ensure that those are efficiently incurred costs but it has no role in the current regulatory regime to say the prices are capped and companies cannot charge customers X, Y, or Z.  They are subject to retail-minus rules and to a different rule for connection charges, which was decided last October, when Eircom put forward a proposal, ComReg did not intervene and, as a result, people can be charged multiples of &euro;170 depending on whether they change retail providers.  The current connection charge is more than &euro;170, but it can be multiples of that depending on how many switches a customer makes.  <br\/><br\/>Many different rules are in the regulation and they are covered for different reasons compared to a state aided project.  Under state aid, ComReg has no role to review how much is spent by the bidder on behalf of the State.  It has no role in clawing back or monitoring that money.  It has no legal power to do any of that; its legal powers come from regulations handed down by Europe when people are designated with market power absent state aid.  That is a critical point.  That adds another layer of complexity for Eircom as a business.  It deals with a complex regulatory framework.  I recall a meeting with a previous Eircom CEO who had not long joined and he told me that the regulation was so complicated that it was like walking into the cockpit of a plane, having never flown a plane before, but the regulatory framework handed down to telecommunications operators is a complicated area.  We have reflected much of that complication in the contract because it is necessary but, unfortunately, the state aid rules handed down by the Commission means another layer of complexity is added to that which one must contract.  Nobody asked for the process to be complicated, long or expensive but the rules of the Commission and of procurement law to ensure a level playing field and equal access to a procurement process by everyone who wants to participate if they qualify lend themselves to a very complicated and difficult process.  In 2015, allowing all bidders equal access to the infrastructure - ESB, Eircom, Enet, masts or towers or whatever, was a very complex area to get under.  The consequence of not doing that job properly was that no one would have bid because they would have felt there was no infrastructure to use, and they would not have known the pricing or products so how could they design a network?  We will come to the over build of 300,000.  It plays into the issue of bidders not being able to bid on something if they do not have clarity on products and pricing.  That makes it very difficult.  <br\/><br\/>Then there is the matter of wholesale access on number G, and what Eir has referred to as an added complexity of additional standards of service which needs to be applied.  We dispute the added level of service.<\/p><p>Under state aid rules, paragraph (g) of section 78 says subsidised companies, which are different from regulated companies, should provide a wider range of wholesale access products than those mandated by NRAs under sectoral regulation to operators with significant market power.  In this case, it would be Eir.  That is because the aid beneficiary is using not just its own resources but taxpayers' money to deploy its own infrastructure.  The rules provide that such wholesale access should be granted as early as possible before starting the network operation.  That will include dark fibre, full unbundling, virtual unbundling access, bitstream and the entire suite of products retailers and wholesalers will expect this network to provide.  If someone wants to deviate from that, the European Commission will say &quot;No&quot;.  One cannot deviate from that because it is state aid.  When one is in a regulatory environment, a regulator and an incumbent can generally negotiate because they need to reach an outcome.  We are somewhat shackled, which is the right word, but appropriately so because state aid is involved and the rules of the European Commission apply.<br\/><br\/>If Ireland approached the Commission and asked if it really needed X and Y, the first thing it would say would be that if Ireland was exempted, Germany, France and Italy would have to be exempted too.  The rules are the rules and they were set out in 2013.  As far as the Commission is concerned, they constitute a legal instrument and it does not deviate from them.  It will not allow a member state to deviate.  We have to get a European Commission state aid decision or we will not be able to spend any state aid.  Until that decision is awarded to Ireland, which we expect it will shortly be, the state aid cannot be spent.  It is a circular thing.  One could say we do not have to abide by these rules, but if one does not, one will never get a state aid decision.  Under the rules, one has to run a thorough, open access procurement process which one ensures can be competitive.  The Commission provides for the event in which that process is not competitive.  It does so because across Europe, there have been uncompetitive processes.  We have used the UK as an example before, but it is across the board.  I saw a presentation seven or eight years ago from DG Competition which said 80% of state aid projects went to incumbents.  The rule of thumb was that the incumbent generally won because it held all the cards.  That is normally what happens in a process because the incumbent will have economies of scale and an advantage over others.  The Commission is trying, through these rules, to rebalance that and it places a significant burden on member states to achieve it.  That is exactly what we did.  We followed the Commission's rules and today we have an operator that does not own the poles and ducts entering a process to use them.  It is a regulated operator and comfort is being taken from that fact.  It will go forward to propose to build a network on those poles and ducts.<br\/><br\/>In terms of how the Commission says one deals with a single bidder process, that is referred to in paragraph (i) of the section.  It provides that monitoring and clawback mechanisms are an absolute requirement.  One must monitor and that goes back to the onerous obligations in our contract in terms of clawback.  As such, the Commission has envisaged a single bidder process.  I go back to the UK and everything else.  In that event, the Commission refers to a scenario in which future costs and revenue developments are surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, which some might say they are here, and there is a strong asymmetry of information.  With a Department and network operators and providers in the market, they are the experts and we are the authority and sometimes an asymmetry of information can exist.  In that case, the Commission says the public authority, namely, the Department, may wish also to adopt a financing model which is not entirely <i>ex ante<\/i>but which is rather a mix of <i>ex ante<\/i>and <i>ex post<\/i>.  An example would be clawbacks to allow balanced sharing of unanticipated gains.  As Mr. Griffin said, we have a &euro;2 billion subsidy for the bidder and we have a contingency set aside of &euro;480 million.  As we have explained before, that is all based on a thorough clawback mechanism on build costs, unanticipated gains in terms of excess profits for the operators and on the value of the business at the end.  That is part of the process.  The Commission does not set out the percentages but rather says it is up to the member state to negotiate the best possible percentages which we believe we have in the circumstances while balancing the incentives for the operator to maximise the output of the network and its success on a commercial basis.<br\/><br\/>People are being unfair in alluding to an unnecessarily complex and protracted process that has been unfair to some bidders.  We do not believe so.  It required substantial bidders with deep pockets to bid and that has cost a great deal of money.  That is just the nature of the process.  We are still at it.  After 2016, 2017 and 2018, there is nothing we have done that people in other member states would not have had to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>We do not believe the extent of the additional burden placed on Eir by virtue of the contract was of the order that its representatives seemed to suggest at the hearings before the committee last week.

This is the area where Eir says there was an unnecessarily duplicated process for it given that it was regulated.  This is the area where we required a separate board, a Minister's appointee and a senior management team ring-fenced for the network we needed to build.  It is fair to say that over the course of 2016 to 2017, there was significant engagement between the Department and Eir because of the unique nature of being regulated in the market and having an Open Eir access team already in place.  We went through a lot of workshops with Eir to ensure it could maximise the Open Eir team while respecting these provisions in the contract.  The provisions in this contract to have a special purpose vehicle for the NBP only were set out in 2015 in the Government decision on the strategy.  It was set out in the requirements of the tender documents which all pre-qualified bidders signed declarations to follow, including Eir.  It did not necessarily disagree that it would not set up a special purpose vehicle.  Where we ended up having a very healthy debate was in relation to the spirit in which it would apply that special purpose vehicle with regard to what the board meant, what its terms of reference were, whether a Minister's appointee would sit on it and what that role would be, and the relationship between the NPB SPV board and the Eir board.  Would the Eir board tell the board of the NBP company that is budget would be affected in a particular year because of a current shortage of cash?  How would that all work?  These are the discussions we had.<br\/><br\/>Eir raised issues around duplication of technical platforms, gateways and billing systems.  My colleague, Mr. Patrick Neary, is the chief technical officer in the Department and he conducted many workshops with the Eir technical team to say we were not sure it was right about that and pointing out that we were requiring it to reuse the relevant infrastructure.  At the end of the workshops, Eir agreed it could use all that and that it would work fine.  It said it just needed to tweak some things to make it NBP company operable.  We did not agree on much of the duplication to which it referred.  We pointed out that we wanted Eir to maximise its economies of scale and that we did not want it to waste State money.  However, we said with regard to the schedule that the independent board and senior management were important.  We said it was important for the NBP company to have a CFO, CEO and CTO dedicated to the massive build.  As the ESB pointed out, the build will involve fibre cabling that could loop around the globe twice.  We thought a stand-alone team was justified in that regard.  If after ten years that was no longer necessary, the contract made significant provision in the change of control procedure in No. 113.  It is a massive part of the contract which sets out that where things are going well and according to plan, the winning bidder will have every opportunity to seek changes to make things more efficient.  Today, however, we are going into the unknown somewhat and it is critical, given the extent of State subsidy involved, that this board is answerable to the Minister, contains a Minister's appointee and is responsible for overseeing the money in.<\/p><p>Eir was asking in the end if it would impact its ability to compete nationally.  Eir wanted to sell a service at a national level so that if Sky, Vodafone or anyone else wanted a national product, Eir would not have to go through the nonsense of selling with both Open Eir and the NBP company.  We said that was fine but we asked how it was going to sell using the Open Eir brand.  We wanted a clear distinction between the revenues of the NBP company and Open Eir so we could manage the clawback and trace the money, as opposed to everything being sold from the NBP company into Open Eir.  There was, without question, a difference of opinion about that.  We believed that was resolvable, and on the cusp of being resolved, just before Eir withdrew from the process.<\/p><p> Eir sent the Department ten red line issues in a letter the week before it withdrew, or the same day.  I looked at them over recent days to see where we still had an issue.  We had an issue as to whether the NBP company could sell into Open Eir and Open Eir could sell to the country.  We had an issue with that in terms of transparency and traceability and the independence of the NBP company board from the Eir board.  That was on the cusp of being resolved and I do not think it was a big hurdle to get over.<\/p><p> We did not agree with the duplication of resources.  We wanted 80 people in the NBP company.  We wanted a board, senior management and an administration team.  It was, without question, going to be an incremental cost but we thought it was a cost worth paying to ensure a team was sitting on this contract and managing it for 25 years or ten years.  The agreement could have been amended once it was all proven and tested and everything was going according to plan.<\/p><p> The Department had a risk that all the contractors Eir used nationally could be cross-subsidised, that Eir could take money from the Department and pay another firm in Dublin or different things like that.  Eir refused to say the Department could impose a clawback mechanism on a contractor that it used across the country.  That also seemed as if it was going to be resolved.  It is no longer there or necessary because of the mechanism we have in place with subcontractors.<\/p><p> We had a red line on the ring-fenced funding.  We wanted Eir to commit funding to the project and have it guaranteed in writing.  We were not landed on that issue and, according to Eir, it was going to be difficult to land on that.  That red line had not moved.<\/p><p> I also mentioned the contagion issue which was a fundamental factor.  The information notice from ComReg came out in June 2018 and Eir left the process in January.  I do not know if that information notice would have kept Eir in the process.  That is a matter between ComReg, Eir and the commission.  As I frequently said to Eir in 2017, I did not believe the position it was taking on contagion was altogether right.  I do not believe it was the risk that Eir perceived it to be, but perhaps, as a business, it took a different view.<\/p><p> Another of Eir's red lines was that it needed more time in the contract.  We were trying to push all bidders to get to a final tender.  We had issued a letter to Eir around that week saying we were open to talk and more dialogue.  Timing was not an issue.  At the time, although this has since been resolved with ComReg, there were issues around equivalence of inputs and whether everyone had to be given equivalence of inputs.  It has since been accepted by Eir, through a ComReg decision in October, that they do, but before that ComReg decision, Eir was disputing that with my colleague.  Its position was that there were certain things it did not believe it was necessary to have equivalence inputs on.  That was one of its red line issues but that has disappeared because ComReg has imposed that on Eir anyway.<\/p><p> There are certain products that the European Commission requires us to have in our product set in this contract, such as dark fibre access and stuff like that.  I am not sure if that was offered under regulation but Eir had raised that as a red line, saying that offering dark fibre in rural areas was a load of nonsense.  That was also under discussion and I do not believe it would have been a red line in the end.<\/p><p> The contagion issue was one of the big red lines that Eir put forward.  I do not think the duplication of resources was a big one and I do not think the ability to sell nationally, with our national platform, was a big issue, and it was on the verge of being resolved before Eir left the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Neary want to come in?

I will explain the intent of that.  When the area including 300,000 households was removed from the process, it created what the ESB referred to as a doughnut of premises around towns and villages that bidders would now need to traverse to get to the intervention homes.  That is 5 or 6 km out the main roads of villages and part of the way down boreens but not all the way to premises at the end of the roads.  Bidders were faced with trying to traverse that area and they considered two options.  One was to use an active product that Eir was developing which reused the fibre that was deployed to service the 300,000 households. The bidder would plug in its own fibre at the end of that area of 300,000 households to address the intervention area or, alternatively, the bidder could rent poles and ducts from Eir to deploy, or use its own structure in the ESB's case, to get across the area of the 300,000 households.  Both options involved network infrastructure sharing and reusing infrastructure.  In the active wholesale product option, the fibre is being rented, but that includes the cost of the rental of the pole and duct that is holding up that fibre and the active equipment, the electronics that are in the telephone exchanges from which Eir manages fibre.  The pole and duct rental option means that a company would be renting the physical pole and the duct in the ground and deploying its own fibre through it.<\/p> <p>  We spent a lot of time with the bidders looking at preferred options and which would work best.  It became apparent that the best option was different for different bidders.  Open Eir's preference was to use the active product and plug the fibre into the fibre that was already on the build that had been done for the 300,000 households.  It was apparent that the other bidders preferred just to use the physical infrastructure of poles and ducts and deploy their own fibre.  The main rationale for that was that those bidders demonstrated that, due to where their design was starting from - metropolitan area networks, MANs, in the case of Granahan McCourt and ESB substations in the case of the ESB - there was not the same cost benefit of using the Eir fibre based on the topology.  At the same time, the cost of the poles and ducts was reduced somewhat based on the volume of poles and ducts that were being used by Granahan McCourt in particular.  It got a lower price for using the pole and duct infrastructure.  That option became a cheaper one and was then more cost efficient for Granahan McCourt to use.  The ESB said in its evidence that it was more cost effective to use its own infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Eir, on the other hand, continued because the design of its network obviously fits directly into where that fibre can be accessed at its exchanges and at the other end towards the intervention area.<\/p><p>It could achieve cost savings in using that product.  That is why Eir chose-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Essentially, it was more cost effective to lay fibre on top of Eir's fibre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#J00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is possible for National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to re-engage and reuse an Eir active product in its deployment.  Any available cost saving could be achieved in certain circumstances.

It seems, based on the presentation made, the lengthy responses, the layers of complexity involved and the rules and regulations which must be met, that in order to protect the &euro;1 billion, the State will have to spend another &euro;2 billion.  That seems ridiculous to the taxpayer and, I am sure, the people waiting for broadband.  Eir which has been getting a bit of a bashing from the Department in recent days - it often gets a bashing from me on other issues - is being portrayed as the big baddie, whereas the truth is the Department entered into an arrangement with Eir to roll out broadband in the original intervention area covering 300,000 homes.

It has already done it in part of the intervention area on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>I can sit here until tomorrow, I am sure, listening to Mr. Mulligan and he will give fact after fact that are all correct.  Is there another model or arrangement that can be entered into?  That may require stalling where we are at now.  Is there another model?  Knowing everything that the Department now knows, and clearly it did not at the beginning, is there another model through the extension of a universal service obligation or whatever that can get us high-speed broadband at the same speeds and quality of service, as in the 300,000 area, for &euro;1 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#J01700","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will make a very quick reference.  Looking at the figures and the gap, it is absolutely not &euro;2 billion in the first instance.  In fairness to Eir's CEO, looking to her testimony, which I have been through and to the letter, it is very clear to me that what she was doing was trying to be helpful to the committee in responding to a question by saying what it would cost to continue the roll-out in rural Ireland to the 300,000.  She was not saying that this would be done as the NBP because once we start to do it as that, clearly, if there is a cheque coming from the taxpayer to fund that, with that comes - I will not go into it - a minimum level of controls so that the taxpayer can be sure that in the event that this thing does not go to plan or if the commitments are not met, we get our money back or we are protected.  In fairness, when we asked Eir for further information, it was forthcoming and quickly responded with information.  It is clear, looking at that, that there are optimistic scenarios, a mid-case scenario and we have our hard case scenario.  Clearly, when we are looking for money for a project like this, we talk of maximum numbers.  We are not going to go into it today regarding the optimistic number in terms of the capital clawback coming to our advantage or the revenue uptake being higher and what that might be.  That kind of speculation would not be helpful.<\/p> <p>  In terms of other models and the USO in particular, there is a USO for copper and it is a USO for functional Internet access.  I do not know how it would work if one tried to do it with one's phone here today but 28 kbps is the functional Internet access.  That is what exists in Ireland today.  The new European electronic communication code, which is due to come into force by December of next year, allows for, and Ireland argued for this in the context of the development of the directive, the provision of adequate broadband through a USO.  The directive is very clear that there is a hierarchy as to how broadband should be provided in member states.  It should be provided in the first instance by commercial operators, which is not surprising because we operate in a liberalised telecoms market.  The next way the directive provides that broadband should be provided is through public policy instruments.  That is the national broadband plan or it could be the approach to spectrum auctions, etc.  One uses the tools available.  Very much as a last and third resort we could have a USO.<\/p> <p>  I understand that this is an area that ComReg would propose to look at when the new code is transposed, in particular in the light of the NBP being delivered, to see if there are areas still remaining.  The code is clear that it is looking to the final percentage as we move forward and even if we have done the whole country.  It is looking to ensure for that percentage if it happened that the approach taken in a member state was such that there were new instances of people who could not get broadband.<\/p> <p>  If Ireland were to take such an approach, the code will have to be transposed in December of next year, ComReg would then have to do its analysis as to whether a USO was appropriate, and then there would have to be engagement with the market on this key term of adequate broadband.  Looking to the directive for the kind of services it should be possible to carry out under the definition of adequate broadband, it would seem that it would be possible to do them at relatively modest broadband speeds.  In the UK, for example, there is a USO of 10 Mbps.  The expectation is that it would be at a low level.  If we were to go the route of introducing a USO, establishing the adequate broadband level and getting it high enough to be meaningful and to work, market players would have to be allowed an opportunity.  We could not just designate.  We would have to allow market operators the opportunity to come forward to offer themselves to be that USO provider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I remain unclear as to why a USO is not possible now.

Surely a USO comes into play when it is needed due to State intervention.  If we were to leave the NBP aside for the moment and we looked again at using the USO model, could that be used to roll out high-speed broadband?  Minimum and adequate levels have been mentioned.  It should not be forgotten that the national broadband plan, in its initial call, only looked for 30 Mbps, and I am on record as calling that into question.

Our contract is exactly akin to a USO that one would impose.  A policy direction will be set, calling for 100% coverage at 30 Mbps, 50 Mbps or 100 Mbps.  The consensus is that 30 Mbps is too low.  At the moment, 150 Mbps is the market minimum where SIRO and Eircom are concerned.  ComReg will be tasked with the same job we have done for three years.  It will have to go to the market and seek out a provider that is willing to do it.  Then it will have to decide how that will be funded.  If it is funded to the tune of &euro;1 billion, &euro;2 billion or whatever, a decision will have to be made on who will pay for that.  There is no provision for this under any USO legislation in Ireland.  Should the State pay that to the universal service provider or should it be spread between all the operators?  Eircom is looking for a small amount of money relative to our numbers and it has gone to the Commercial Court under the old USO regime.  The old USO regime was an automatic designation because of its legacy incumbency on the copper network.  The connection charge for anyone that wants a copper connection has been the same for about 15 years.  It is &euro;117.  We are charging &euro;100, so it is not too different.  The consumer paid nothing unless the cost went over &euro;7,000 in what was called a regulated access threshold.  We have a similar threshold in our contract but it is set at &euro;5,000.  The USO model to date and any likely USO model in the future are very similar to the model we have today.  Would going into the USO world lead to a different outcome?  The State could not designate Eircom automatically.  Vodafone, SIRO and wireless operators would all have to be given the opportunity to seek funding.  A procurement process would take place.  We would face the infrastructure problem I just mentioned.  Everybody would have to have equal access to the infrastructure to be a designated operator and get funding from either the State or from ComReg to do the job.  The State would face a circular problem of how to make this work given all the competing operators that would want a piece of the pie.

Sky has challenged the decision to allow that charge.  Retailers are not so happy with that regime.  That regime only came into play after we set the rules of the procurement process.  We always set the fee at &euro;100 because that was the rule that existed at the time.  It is akin to the rule under the USO.  We have to look at it from an affordability point of view.  If we increase the connection charge from &euro;100 to &euro;200, for example, we might bring in an extra &euro;15 million in revenue in the first ten years.  However, we do not want to reduce demand on this network by instituting a connection charge regime that puts people off connecting.  That would increase the required subsidy.  Increasing the connection charge might generate short-term revenue through the initial connections, but in the long term it will reduce revenue because fewer people will connect or they will take longer to do so.  Therefore the subsidy required in the business model will actually increase over 25 years.  The connection model is a red herring from a subsidy perspective.  It does not lower the subsidy.  We are better off offering the consumer a &euro;100 connection charge.  In the model used for the group of 300,000 homes the average connection cost is about &euro;460.  Ms Carolan Lennon said this.  In the intervention area, where an average-cost model applies, it is a lot higher than that.  If we used the Eircom model, consumers would pay &euro;1,000 or more to connect if they were not within 50 m of the road.<\/p><p> Ms Lennon referred to the fact that we are offering ducting into every home.  We are offering an overhead network along the lines of the Eir model.  The only difference is that we are saying to consumers that if we cannot get them overhead network connections and if they have to have ducting because there is no other alternative, we will subsidise and pay for the ducting.  We are not going to ask a person to get a mini-digger out put the ducting through his or her garden.  However, if we are given permission to put the ducting through a garden, we will do it and it will be subsidised.  Why will we do that?  We will do it because we believe that many consumers do not have mini-diggers or the opportunity to get one in order to build a connection for &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000.  We are subsidising the connection up to &euro;5,000 because there are a lot of homes with broken ducts that cannot get an overhead connection or that need an extra four or five poles to get the connection down there.  As Ms Lennon stated, a pole costs &euro;600.  There are many homes in rural Ireland that are not within 50 m of the border of the road.  There are poles every 40 m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#L02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The bulk of them have copper wire going into them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#M00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I live in rural Ireland and I do not have copper wire because I built I built the house in the past 15 years.  The majority of young families in rural Ireland that built homes in the past 15 years are using mobiles.  I looked for a landline but there was an ESB line coming across something and I was told to build my own duct.  I knew I would be obliged to pay for that.  I asked myself what was the point and decided to use a mobile.  This is how the USO for that worked.  There were supposed to connect me but it did not happen because there was an issue.  It is not as simple as it is being made out to be because the process involved is complex.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the 300,000 properties, there is an issue where Eir's connection costs are not the same as those for the intervention area.  We know that the average cost of connections is much higher than within 50 m of the road because we are dealing with every extremity.  In the case of the worst extremities, we estimated 2%.  We stated that we might have to do wireless but that we are going to connect the rest.  That 100% obligation is the key difference from the Eir proposal.  The fundamental difference is that there is no state aid involved.  However, let us forget about that for a moment.  Eir is regulated for, at most, five years at a time.  ComReg would confirm that it cannot give any assurances beyond five years that regulation can be relied upon to regulate Eir in respect of poles and ducting within a state aid environment.  Everything in the obligations package regarding service quality, future proofing and capacity, service level agreements, clawbacks and the other provisions in the contract cannot, therefore, be done through regulation or the commitment agreement.  One's whole contract is gone if one reaches a commitment-style agreement.  Future-proofing was always a tenet of this.  In April 2014, we stated that this is a long-term infrastructural investment on the part of the State and is therefore a long-term contract.  Regulation does not do long-term contracts.

I am sure the witnesses have been following the hearings we have had on this, but it is still hard to understand how, given that the State is putting all the money in, we do not own the asset at the end.  One thing we learned from what Eir said last week is that fibre stands up well against lightning and wet Irish conditions.  The experience of the 340,000 houses is that fibre holds up well and will hold up even better if we are building a new network.  What Analysys Mason said today is slightly different from what it said to this committee.  Is hard to reconcile what it says in its note to the Department with what it said here about the benefits of having a dual network.  Given that we are creating that dual network and, according to Eir, that the fibre is standing up well to the environment in rural Ireland, why are we giving away the assets that we are paying for?  Is there anything the two University of Limerick academics said in that regard that does not make sense?  I found their arguments compelling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#N01700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>We have been dealing with this intensively since 2015.  We went out and consulted on it and, interestingly, Eir, which was before the committee last week, supported a gap funded model.  We then did a project reappraisal in 2018 when we were down to one bidder.  A comprehensive review was done from the ground up as to whether the gap funded model was the right way to go, from both a financial and non-financial perspective.  The answer was \"Yes\".  We covered this in our previous submission.  The key piece in ensuring the effectiveness of the gap funded model is putting the protections Mr. Mulligan referred to in place in the contract .  Those include the claw-back provisions and provisions for future-proofing and so on, and having strong governance mechanisms in place in the Department to oversee it.  One thing that struck me about the intervention by the two academics from the University of Limerick was the way in which they drew comparisons with public private partnership, PPP, projects.  The PPP sector in Ireland delivers projects or services traditionally provided by the public sector, with assets reverting to the State.<\/p><p>We are in a space where we are looking at how to provide services in areas that are not served by the commercial sector but for a technology that is traditionally provided by that sector and where the public sector has to step in and provide a subsidy.  One is comparing apples and oranges to a certain extent.  I understand, of course, that this is one of the issues that people have found quite perplexing and we have dealt with it comprehensively in the original documents that we put forward all the way through the analysis when Eir dropped out and we were left with a single bidder.  We asked KPMG to talk to us about whether the arrangement still stands up in a single bidder solution and if it does, what are the additional protections we need to layer on top of that to ensure the State gets value for money and that it is fully protected in the investment that it makes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#N01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses and thank them for their painstaking efforts to explain it.

It occurred to me that if he had been in this room last week listening to Eir, he could only draw one conclusion, if he believed everything it said, and I say this with great respect and not in a flippant way, which is that we had a totally incompetent public service and we had incompetent politicians leading our policy makers.  I do not believe either is the case but it would be a reasonable observation.  Either Eir is correct or the departmental officials are not up to their job.  A lay person could only look at the situation in that way.  One cannot say both are up to it, if Eir is telling the truth.  For those who are watching the proceedings of this committee, it will occur to them that somebody is off the wall in this regard and somebody is not up to what they are at.  Either the representatives from Eir who appeared before the committee last week were putting in red herrings and erroneous stuff or the officials present are defending the indefensible.

I think the people watching the proceedings have a right to know the answer to this question.  The Eir proposition will cost consumers a great deal more and I would like the witnesses to put figures on that because the public needs to know.

In the current bid, our bidder is saying that it is not assuming that 2% because it does not expect urban prices to go up by 2% every year and telecom prices generally do not follow inflation.  I think the telecom federation has presented numerous times saying that telecom prices have generally gone down the curve compared to inflation, which has gone up.

First, it incurred a significant capital cost for the State, as the remaining bidder had no guarantee that it would be able to use Eir's infrastructure or that there would be no difficulties in accessing it.  Second, the remaining bidder would be prohibited from generating income within Eir's area, which continues to expand.  According to the letter from Eir which we received approximately an hour before this meeting, there are specific examples of reusing the lessons and infrastructure for the 300,000 premises.  In the access network open eir's rural 300,000 premises design also included spare fibre to facilitate the roll-out beyond the boundaries of the 300,000 premises footprint.  According to the letter, Eir offered the use of this spare fibre to National Broadband Ireland but, for reasons unclear to it, it declined to use it and instead overbuilt on it.  This has been a major question and a number of issues arise.  Mr. Mulligan was present at the press conference when the Minister announced this in April 2017.  The minute the A3 sized map was laid out in front of us, what was happening was clear.  Clusters of houses, villages and towns were being connected by Eir.  I will put a straight question to Mr. Mulligan.  He stated Eir had to be allowed to proceed.  Ministers have said the same.  However, has the Department ever laid the map down in front of the European Commission and stated that, by allowing this to happen, it would banjax the process and make it more difficult?  This is not just being stated by Analysys Mason.  The ESB has been stating for a long time that it was blown out of the process and has made this clear more publicly in recent weeks.  Were there detailed meetings and conversations with the European Commission about how, if this were allowed to happen in the case of the 840,000 premises being serviced, it would doughnut the housing clusters and villages and make the situation next to impossible?  Apart from the increased complexity, consider the amount of discussion and hours spent on this issue.  We can only imagine what the 80 people working on it have been doing to try to work through this complex web, or what some would call a mess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#Q01700","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Yes, we had detailed discussions with the European Commission and, yes, we showed it the doughnut maps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#Q01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Did it tell the Department that it had to allow this to go ahead, even though it would banjax the process for the other 540,000 premises?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#Q02000","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The Commission stated that, under state aid rules, we were required to remove those premises if a commercial operator was covering the majority in the given areas, which comprised the 300,000 premises.

I have read some of its rulings on state aid and broadband.  There have been judgments and pronouncements in that regard.  From the ESB's point of view and in terms of what Analysys Mason which was hired by the Department stated, this decision blew the process to pieces.  I am not an expert in this field and neither are many lay people; therefore, we must go by what the Department tells us, but it was clear on the day of the announcement in April 2017 that the process would be in major difficulty once this happened because it would make everything more expensive.  The bidder would have to lease poles and toy with the decision as to whether to use the fibre that had already been laid by Eir or overlay new fibre and install a parallel system.

They stated it was a very limited role.  Mr. Mulligan confirmed that they have had no involvement of any description since 2018.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the overall project, there are a couple of points that are fairly clear to the public and those, such as ourselves, looking at it.  One is that the 340,000 premises that have been cherry-picked by Eir, and that Eir is serving commercially, created significant problems.  We had a discussion around that.  That created many difficulties in terms of the complexities and the cost and logistical problems which Mr. Neary would have dealt with, as well as technical matters around the rest of the project involving the other 500,000 premises.  The ESB and Eir walked away after that and both of them confirmed that that is why.  After that, they basically left the process.<\/p> <p>  Then there is the cost.  The issue that the public is really exercised about is that we will take almost &euro;1 billion of Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer's money and we will give it to this entity that is backed by American investors.  I have nothing against Americans - it just happens to be so.  That American investor will then hand this to another private entity called Eir in order that it can hang the cables to get the broadband to the people's houses that people will then pay for.  Is not that the crux of this issue?  Are not those two factors, the 340,000 premises being taken out of the 840,000 and that there has to be a subsidy paid to the private investment entity to hand to another entity - another private company which, by the way, we owned until it was privatised - the root of this whole problem?  It is unfortunate that we do not still have the infrastructure in State ownership because it would have saved a great deal of hassle for everyone.  Is not that the crux of what has driven the price of this project out through the roof?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#S00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>It is a short answer.

There has been a good deal of focus around - because it is a figure of almost &euro;1 billion - &euro;900 million plus that we have in the model that would be paid to Eir for rental of poles over 25 years.  That is based on the regulated pricing that is in place by ComReg.  That is an estimate of what the cost of operating and maintaining that network over 25 years would be.  It costs to build a network and then it costs to maintain that network, and one must pay those costs.  If the State built its own network, the State would have to invest similar-type sums to maintain that network over 25 years.  We have included in the tender the cost today that ComReg says is required to pay to maintain those poles and ComReg will regulate that going forward for so long as ComReg sees that it is necessary.  That is a real cost.  That is not giving somebody a return on earlier investment.

I refer to the criticality of reusing existing infrastructure to the greatest extent possible.  We have already received some criticism about the fact that we have had to traverse the Eir 300,000, but if we ended up building a new network in the intervention area, the cost to the taxpayer would be multiples of what is on the table at present.<\/p> <p>  The other important point is that Eir has worked closely with NBI over the past while to try to come to an arrangement which works commercially for it and for NBI in terms of access to its infrastructure.  Eir is involved in an access infrastructure agreement.  The company will be working on a make-ready programme which is critical to the roll-out of this contract when it gets under way.  Eir is a really important player in all of that.  That is quite understandable because we need access to its infrastructure, both poles and ducts.  We circulated some figures.  Ninety per cent of the Eir pole network is used and probably a higher percentage of the Eir duct network.  It is a critical part of the project overall.  In terms of the duct network, 338,000 km of new duct and 14,000 km of duct rented from Eir, and 90,000 new poles and 1.2 millions poles rented from Eir.  Eir is a major part of the equation.  That is inevitable when one goes back to the state aid rules, which make a big play about reuse of infrastructure.  Ultimately, it ends up a cheaper way to do the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the Department for its presentation.

We made the point all along in the process that we are talking now about providing an infrastructure.  We know some of the areas to which it will provide advantages.  The areas the Senator mentioned are some of them.  However, we are providing an infrastructure to deal with issues that have not even been conceived now.<\/p><p>Looking at the evolution of technology over the past ten years, there were no smartphones ten years ago.  Everything that is done now by virtue of a smartphone can be seen, and the sort of high-tech technologies that are being produced.  Even today, ESB has talked about the roll-out of its first tranche of smart meters in Cork over the next couple of years.  High-speed broadband and technology are needed to ensure consumers reap the benefits of that in terms of time of use tariffs, better use of electricity in the home and the climate change agenda.  This is a qualitative suite of benefits that are not allowed to be factored in or crunched with regard to the numbers, but to me they are as important, if not more important, than the things on which a figure can be put.  That was a point we consistently made to our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We were very clear on that in the submission of the memorandum for Government.  Some of the things this technology will do have not even been invented.  Regarding the figures we saw, 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet of things by 2020.  This is a colossal figure.  We are talking about smarter homes and offices and, down the road, autonomous driving.  There is enormous potential.  We have not fully conceived what that potential is but the provision of this fibre technology where there are unlimited download speeds and so on will be very important.<\/p><p> Regarding the roll-out, we are looking at having more than 200,000 homes passed by the end of the year with a large number of them connected in the intervention area .  We have also provided in the contract for broadband connection points.  This is the sort of stuff we have seen publicised in the Aran Islands where people can come together, get a high-speed connection, have a proper office set-up and be able to work from there well in advance of getting the connection in their home.  This creates a very effective working community within the locality where people can work.  If we look at Apple in Cork, we can see that a large number of people work from home where they can.  More of that will happen.  From speaking to the large technology companies, we know that they are absolutely up for this.  The future of work and jobs will change dramatically.  We will see individuals working from home but on a team basis, cloud computer services, collaborative conferences and so on.

These guidelines require member states to have a clawback.  The guidelines state that it is up to member states to negotiate the best possible clawback.  The state aid guidelines do not prescribe the percentages.  Again, there is a percentage of clawback for the build, a percentage for excess profits if everything goes wonderfully well and a percentage for excess profits relating to the value of a business at the end of it, particularly if it is a gap funding model.  This can range from 0% to 100% with regard to any of these three categories and that is where the best possible outcome for the State is negotiated while keeping incentives on the bidder.  In a perfect world where there were multiple bidders and perfect competition, which is virtually impossible to achieve in a telecommunications sector like this given the incumbencies and the different technologies and infrastructures available, it is less risky with regard to bidders coming in with a prudent view on costs or likely profits.  In a less competitive or a risky environment regarding a contract like this for 25 years, no matter what the competition or process, all bidders are likely to have a very conservative view.  That is what we found with the three bidders at the table.  Nobody was running to make the cheapest possible offer because the consequence of doing that later on - going bankrupt - was fairly significant.  We were dealing with three bidders that had a very realistic view of the world.  That realistic view was that prices might go up.  It is like the Baz Luhrmann song in that certain things can be guaranteed but it can nearly always be guaranteed that prices and materials will go up.  Therefore, there is no point in predicting that prices will not go up and ending up getting burned.  In addition, we did not want to deal with operators that told us that prices will go up by 10% every year and that if they did, the State needed to give them all this money.  We told them that we might give them some money but if it did not happen and the increase was 2% every year, we would claw that back.<\/p> <p>  In the current situation with most of the cost for build, we claw back 100%.  That is what we got to after Eir left.  Mr. Griffin mentioned that the recommendation was to go forward with a much improved and robust contract and governance model because we were in a single bidder situation.  Before Eir left, we did not have 100% clawback.  We had 50% regarding the majority of the build costs.  It was a significant shift from having two to three bidders in the process to having one bidder on the main risk cost areas where we now only pay what it costs.  Although it was not fully negotiated, previously, the commercial guys would have been looking for 50% of the savings that may have been realised, which would have been a significant bonus to them if they realised savings.<\/p> <p>  From memory, the figure relating to excess profits was a lot less than what we have now, which is 60%.  It had been 50%.  Again, we negotiated that up rather than down, which in a competitive environment would have been probably negotiated down by competitors, the more risk they saw with the project and the greater the risk relating to construction and demand.<\/p><p>On terminal value, I believe we now have 40%.  We had a lot less before.  I cannot remember the percentage.  It might not have been much but we got a much better outcome in a single bidder situation on the claw-backs to the State.  I refer to protecting ourselves from the single bidder situation, which may take a more conservative view on costs and demand, but that is exactly what the state aid guideline sets out.  Where there is asymmetric information involving the authority and the bidder, one includes protections related to a claw-back.  It happens all over Europe.  As I said before, BDUK has already clawed back from BT &pound;700 million or &pound;800 million in certain projects in the UK.  It would probably have predicted certain scenarios where the risk did not reflect what was actually the case.  As ESB said, in a project of the scale in question, considering the scale of the construction risk, a seven-year period in which many housing and construction projects would be taking place, and the fact that subcontractors are out the door, nobody can predict the prices.  It is, therefore, hard to make predictions for a model.  The company predicted what might happen to prices.  We have contingency plans if the trend gets worse.  We have 100% claw-back if it gets better.  That is a significant part of the governance model that Mr. Griffin alluded to.  We expect the &euro;10 million per year that we may spend on governance to be more than covered by savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Is the &euro;10 million the special purpose vehicle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Where does that fit in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>The special purpose vehicle is National Broadband Ireland.

Everybody would agree that Eir had concluded a fairly arduous commitment agreement negotiation with us for six months, or nine months, starting with the first draft of the contract agreement.  That was a difficult process.  We imposed significant, onerous requirements on the company, which, in the main, we understand it met in terms of the passing and connecting milestone.  It is nearly there.  I do not believe Eir would say the aspect to which the Senator referred did not add complexity to the procurement process.  I am sure its bid team - it had a bid team that was separate from the commercial team - would admit that having to remove the 300,000, redo its network design, reproduce the commercial model and renegotiate the legal contract added complexity to its process in dealing with us, and in our dealing with it.  The same applied to the SIRO bidders and Granahan McCourt.  From that perspective, all three bidders were in the same position.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about the impact on cost and the subsidy.  A mixture of many aspects had an impact on where we are now.  On the subsidy, there is less revenue in the model so clearly bidders such as the ESB would say there was a lot less revenue and it was, therefore, less commercial.  One bidder said it believed there was a pretty significant impact on its ability to bid but, again, it was planning to use its own network.  It might see the world differently from Eir, which was using its network.  Enet was planning to use the Eir network or the MAN, or a combination of both.  Therefore, there were three different bidders with three different views of the world in terms of the commercial impact of the 300,000.  The ESB indicated clearly in the past week that it had a significantly detrimental impact on its commercial view of the world in this context.  There may also be other aspects it is considering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>What will be the position on tendering if, God forbid, we are to proceed to re-tendering?

It was agreed in that exercise that the first step would be to set up a broadband agency or special purpose vehicle within the State that would be mandated to deliver broadband.  The agency would then be tasked with developing a strategy.  The exercise is similar to the one started in 2014.  We brought together an international panel of experts.  We used ComReg and we took on PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Analysys Mason, and Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran as advisers.  We conducted a series of public consultations to develop the strategy, taking into account the state aid guidelines and views of the industry.  That took 20 months.  Mr. Griffin said we did not have 20 months in which to launch a new procurement process.  We need to proceed much faster.  Through parallel work, etc., we concluded we could do that, including through developing a new cost-benefit analysis, which is required under the public spending code, and conducting a project appraisal and preparing procurement documentation.  We expected it would take 16 months just to get to the start of a new procurement process.  Regarding the procurement itself, if there were a pre-qualification period of six months, dialogue and bilateral engagement with bidders, a further six months would elapse.  To date, it has taken us 26 months to do that.  Evaluating the final tender would take three months.  Selecting a preferred bidder would take another three months.  In our process to date, the final part has taken eight months.  Taking an extremely optimistic view of procurement, we believe it would take 18 months to conclude a procurement process.  Taking the two elements together, and taking the state aid approval process and the issue of contract closure into account, it would take at least 37 months to conclude a new procurement process from the start.  That is a very optimistic view, based on a fair wind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>If the contract were to be paused or cancelled, what implications would it have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U01300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The first question I would ask the Senator about that would be the basis for doing that.  Eir withdrew and it is very clear from what it said, both in evidence to the committee and the letter sent to the Department and committee, that what it was submitting was not to be considered as a proposal.  It was to be regarded as an hypothetical assessment of what could be done if a range of conditions applied.<\/p><p>I see no reason whatsoever, frankly, to even discuss that.<\/p><p> The second point echoes what we said in our document.  If we go back to scratch, we have to go back to the initiation of a public procurement process.  We got legal advice on that when it was mooted that perhaps we could assign the project to ESB, a commercial semi-State company.  The legal advice was unambiguous.  My interpretation is that if we start talking about a dominant player in the market then the legal advice becomes even stronger because we have an economic undertaking in a dominant position in the telecommunications market.  We cannot go back in and negotiate based on something that is on the table.  We have concluded a process that we believe is robust.  It has arrived at an outcome.  A preferred bidder has been appointed.  We have a suite of protections in place that we believe will be effective.<\/p><p> I did not get a chance to say this when Deputy Stanley said there was no competition, but we have highlighted previously that the fact we only have a single better bidder in this competition is not unusual - it was the same in the United Kingdom.  The critical thing is how to stitch in the protections for the State and the taxpayer and we believe we have done that.  We have a preferred bidder appointed and we are in a process.  My answer to the question is to ask why we would move from what we are doing to something that the company itself has said is not an offer.  It is an assessment of giving us something under a different process and using certain hypothetical assumptions about how the company might do it.  We could end up in a sort of death spiral, if I can call it that, if we halt or pause procurement and then go back out to the market.  Who do we get to bid then?  People have come forward in good faith in recent years and involved themselves in a process.  I am uncertain that we would get a field of bidders.  There will be a risk to the process.  A decision has been made that someone in the process has been in some way given a status that would leave the outcome of that process open to challenge.  We have no guarantee that if we went out to a process, having looked at the evidence of Eir, that the company would necessarily come back in.  It may come back in on those terms but we are bound by state aid rules and normal contract law, both of which hold that we cannot offer the company something on those terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070300002#U01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I have a final question.

I would expect nothing less.  We too are elected to ensure the same thing, among others, the difference being that we will be thrown out of our jobs if we do not abide by it.<\/p> <p>  The taxpayer, as has been alluded to by others, is aware that the Department and the Government are moving towards finalising the contract to employ what many see as an unknown entity with no experience or history of the provision of such a product in this area.  The exposure to the taxpayer is &euro;2.9 billion.  This is along the lines of what Senator O'Reilly said.  Meanwhile, Eir says now, definitively, that it can do the same thing, that is to say, provide broadband to every home, with an exposure to the taxpayer of &euro;1 billion.  That is inclusive of VAT and contingencies and it is an informed estimate because of the experience that Eir has since had with the 300,000 extra connections originally intended to be in the national broadband plan.<\/p> <p>  In response to this contention, Mr. Griffin and his colleagues state there are rules that must be adhered to, especially state aid rules.  We now know that is contested by reputable opinion.  It would appear that there is nothing definitively in writing from the Commission to back up the Department's contention.  Mr. Griffin also says there are issues surrounding governance and oversight.  I am not a member of this committee but I have responsibility to speak for my party on public expenditure matters.  As Deputy Dooley said earlier, it would appear the Department is spending &euro;2 billion to protect &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>  The last questioner asked what would happen if the whole process was paused at this stage.  Mr. Griffin asked about the basis for that and noted that Eir withdrew from the process.  He says the contention from Eir, as well as the information the company has given to the Department and the committee, are not to be considered as a proposal.  It would appear the Department is simply carrying on regardless.  The Department has legal advice that contravenes what the company contends, states or insists could be the case.  Is the Department simply doing us a favour by entertaining us in this process, despite the best intentions of those who called for this process?<\/p> <p>  I have some specific questions on foot of that.  This did not simply become a story recently when Eir submitted details to the committee on how it was in a position to provide the same solution for &euro;1 billion rather than &euro;3 billion.  Eir wrote to the Department in January 2018.  Can Mr. Griffin confirm that?  While Eir might not have stated that it could do the job in a certain way or that it would give customers or the public or the taxpayer what they wanted for &euro;1 billion, the company did say it could do it at a fraction of the cost.  What consultation or correspondence has taken place with Eir since the Department received that letter?<\/p> <p>  I have some other questions.  I had to listen to the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government tell us that they looked at every alternative and every other option, as is their duty.  They said they went over and under them and considered them and reconsidered them but were left with no option but to proceed along the course as we know it now.  Meanwhile, this letter was sitting on someone's desk since January 2018.  I have no correspondence or information to tell me that the matter was investigated to the nth degree at the time or that it was checked, rechecked, considered and reconsidered based on what was contained in that letter.<\/p> <p>  The State has conferred preferred bidder status to Granahan McCourt Capital.<\/p><p>What cost does the State incur in the event of a contract not being finalised or signed?  I asked the Minister that question at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  He could not answer and said he would come back to me.  That was about a month or six weeks ago and I have not got an answer yet.  In the meantime I put it in writing.  It is important and the public need to know.  If there was a breakdown in the negotiations on a contract with the preferred bidder, what legal status is given to the bidder and what cost is associated with that?  That is against the background of the &euro;200 million it is putting in.  People say the wholesale contract allows a recoup.  However, if it goes to the wall, the taxpayer picks up the cost, end of story.  It might not be the case with a reputable firm like Eir, but it is definitely the case in this instance.<\/p><p> All joking aside, the Department is hell-bent on implementing this process at a cost of &euro;2 billion to save &euro;1 billion.  If Eir said it could deliver this to every home for &euro;1 billion, would Mr. Griffin accept its good faith?

There is much more information and knowledge on how the project can be delivered.  That also comes into play.  Many are alarmed about this and want these hearings to get to the root of it.  In that context, I have heard that a letter came from Eir in 2018 further to a meeting that had only taken place a couple of days earlier, to which Mr. Griffin alluded, rightly so, but the response from the then Minister was not adequate to refute the suggestion and contention made in the letter about it being done at a fraction of the cost.  The Department needed to state at the time that the Government was not backing down for anybody, that it was proceeding, carrying on and sticking to the process it had put in place, irrespective of the fact that there might only be one bidder left or that it still believed the project could be delivered within seven or eight years.  We are now at a juncture where if the Government sit downs to reconsider the matter, it will involve another period of years in procurement.  That baffles people.  What they cannot get their heads around and what I am trying to get my head around is that an entity, with vast experience and expertise and which has much of the infrastructure in place, has stated it will give us something for &euro;1 billion, while somebody else, about whom I know nothing, is putting up &euro;200 million and exposing the State to a figure of &euro;2.9 billion and saying he can do the same thing at a cost of &euro;3 billion to us.

I am joined by Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Sullivan, who has been appointed as secretary to the board.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Health signed the commencement order for the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 last week and attended the first meeting of the new board on Friday.  The establishment of an independent board to oversee the HSE is a really important step in improving the governance of the health service.  It is also one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which is the first of two reasons I am privileged to be here today.  I and my fellow board members will make as good a contribution as we possibly can to achieve the committee&rsquo;s expectations as expressed in the report.  As one reads the Sl&aacute;intecare report, one gets more and more excited and impressed.  The plan and the cross-party support for it was a large part of why I went for the role.<\/p> <p>  The committee&rsquo;s invitation referred to gaining an insight into my experience and vision for the role on this, the most important State board.  I was educated, as Gaeilge, in Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Parnell Square, Dublin, and as a chemical engineer at UCD.  My work experience to date has largely been in the UK with some time in the US and continental Europe.  My early career was in the chemical and life sciences industry, followed by time in management consulting where most of what I did was run complex change programmes in large multinational companies.  I have been chief executive of the British Council since 2015.  I have focused on aligning the British Council behind key themes important to the UK in education and culture, as well as strengthening the organisation&rsquo;s capacity and capability across its network of offices in 115 countries.<\/p> <p>  It is probably the bit in the middle which is more obviously aligned with the HSE.  From 2007, I was chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support where I helped the organisation reshape cancer services across the four nations of the UK, both on its own and in collaboration with other organisations, leading to Macmillan being perceived consistently as the public&rsquo;s most respected charity in the UK.  Some of what we did was about new care models, the use of data to measure and improve outcomes, while other aspects were around focusing on patient experience.<\/p> <p>  In terms of governance, I have held non-executive roles on the boards of a range of organisations from small local charities to the board of NHS England, which commissions healthcare for the population of England.  There are differences, as well as similarities, between the HSE and NHS England.  Both, however, are the organisations and boards with the ultimate accountability for spending taxpayers&rsquo; money to deliver the best possible healthcare for the available money for the population of the jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  I believe my experience to date puts me in a good position to lead the board of the HSE on its transformational journey as set out in Sl&aacute;intecare, while holding the HSE to account for delivering the current plan.  In doing so, we must have the credibility to make the changes needed to have a health service that will continue to serve the public into the future.<\/p> <p>  The board had its first formal meeting on Friday, but we had got together informally several times previously.  I am pleased with the calibre of those the Minister has appointed to the board of the HSE.  Like myself, and indeed all those who believe in public service and the public health service, we are united in having a driving ambition to ensure Ireland has a world-class health system of which we can be proud.  The board currently comprises ten other members, with an additional member to be appointed by the Minister presently.  We are varied and have different competencies, including clinical and governance expertise, patient advocacy, change management and financial management.  My role is to bring this together into one properly functioning board, holding people to account while, at the same time, driving strategic direction.  I am pleased with the appointment of Mr. Paul Reid as chief executive officer.  I look forward to working with him and his executive colleagues on this shared ambition.<\/p> <p>  The cross-party political support that underpinned the development of Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a great and once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a forward-looking health service.  The board must exploit the momentum for change in the best possible way.  We must ensure we have the right systems and controls in place to ensure the financial stability and predictability of the HSE.  The board must support the executive to ensure we create public confidence in the HSE&rsquo;s financial management, which will then allow us to seek further investment for the implementation of other aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  I have had a chance to discuss our short-term and long-term priorities with board members, officials and Ministers.  The key priorities are developing and implementing an effective performance management and accountability system in the HSE; building public trust and confidence in the HSE and the wider health service; ensuring the HSE&rsquo;s full support for and implementation of the Government&rsquo;s programme of healthcare reform, as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan; and supporting the leadership and staff of the HSE to continue to improve health outcomes of the public, as well as retaining them.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal to be proud of in our health services, in particular the significant progress made on outcomes such as increased life expectancy.  Since 1990, life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost seven years.  In an average year, the life expectancy of our population typically goes up three months.  In a typical day, it goes up six hours.  On average, since 1990, every day of every year has seen life expectancy of the average citizen go up by three months per year.  This is truly astonishing and one of the fastest rates of improvement in developed economies.  There is more to be done, however.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the board, we are looking forward to working with the wide range of stakeholders, including the committee, to do the job recommended in Sl&aacute;intecare, which is expected of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Devane for his opening statement.

Presumably he believes holding the executive team to account is one of its roles, but does he believe its powers extend to tabling sanctions if necessary, up to and including removing the director general or other members of the executive team?

We operate in an ecosystem.  The policy side of strategy, which is the purview of the Department, informs how we do what do.  That needs to be a dialogue, and there are choices to be made in finding the best way to implement an agreed overarching vision and strategy.  If strategy is about making choices about what to do when, what to do later, and what not to do at all, then we absolutely have to have a role in that.  However, I do not believe we should do that in isolation.  It is a public sector board, so we do it in the context of overall policy, and we have to ensure we work with the other organisations in the ecosystem as well.  We should not be isolationist or do things on our own.  We have to engage in that dialogue.  If we believe that good dialogue leads to good strategy, then that is important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of accountability, as well as having the carrot and the stick, it is important to have the right processes in place, because they create clarity so people know what they are being held accountable for, and that that accountability is for the whole range of things.  One person is not accountable for the money and someone else for meeting the access targets.  It has to be collective because they are so intertwined.  I see it as making sure that cascade of accountability, and the necessary clarity, are in place.  We also need to recognise and reward where people are performing.  The reward does not have to be financial, but can be about opportunity, engagement, promotion, and so on.  Equally, if someone is not performing, we need to have a conversation with them, and they might be better off elsewhere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>At an executive level, does Mr. Devane feel the board has the authority, if necessary, to remove a director general from his or her post, if the board believes he or she is not performing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#F00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Yes.

I note that in Mr. Devane's opening statement, he refers to the board's priorities.  Those priorities are all fine, but I do not see issues around access for patients or quality listed there.  People are now waiting three, four, or five years just to see a consultant.  Access in some areas in Ireland is worse than in parts of Africa.  It is the worst in the OECD, and we have the lowest number of consultants<i>per capita <\/i>anywhere in the OECD.  We have the second lowest number of hospital beds in the OECD.  We have reached a complete crisis.  Consultants say the hospital system is on fire.  There is a crisis in the lack of access for men, women, and children.  The narrative is that the Irish healthcare system is difficult to get access to but is brilliant once one gets in, but while bits of it are, other bits are not.  We have unsafe staffing levels all over the system, which was noted in Mr. Paul Reid's briefing.  As the incoming chair, what are Mr. Devane's views on this?  First, would he agree that we have a crisis in access to healthcare?  What needs to be done in the short term to deal with these waiting times of three, four, or five years?  What are some of his short-term priorities for the board, in order to address some of the quality issues in the system, while accepting that some of it is excellent?  I will leave my questions at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#F00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>That is obviously a large question.  I agree that access is a problem, for all the reasons the Deputy noted.  It is the metrics, and what taxi drivers tell people.  It is well understood, and therefore, it is a priority.<\/p> <p>  In the short term, we as a board would focus on two things.  One is the need for programmes which directly address access issues at particular points.  The second issue is that models of care need to shift to a model which allows rapid access and rapid discharge, so that the throughput of a system can be changed.  Some of that is due to staffing levels, and some is about models of care.<\/p> <p>  We have been talking about setting up board committees, and we have agreed that and allocated board members to four committees.  One is audit and risk, as one would expect.  We will also have a people and culture committee, which will look at strategic HR, and will do more than a traditional remuneration committee.  The quality and safety committee will examine everything from the never event space, as well as whether we are delivering the outcomes we should at the right levels.  The performance and delivery committee will look directly at metrics, including waiting times and access as well as whether we are delivering the number of procedures we said we would for the cost we said.  We will have those committees.  Two of them are specifically focused on a patient-oriented point of view, while the people and culture will focus on how to make this the best place to work, as well as somewhere that delivers the best health outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Devane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#F00700","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I welcome both the witnesses and wish them the very best in their roles.  Mr. Devane referred to the issues of access and capacity.  The first recruitment moratorium was introduced in the HSE 12 years ago.  By way of context, I happened to be a trade union organiser at the time, and we were engaged in an industrial dispute with the HSE about what the Government of the day was doing in with that moratorium.  We are feeling its effects now, and will continue to feel them for quite some time.  At the time, we were given to understand that the board had relatively little, if any, involvement and that it could not take a position or view on the moratorium.   However, from what Mr. Devane said about the establishment of these committees, it seems his intention is to be proactive around issues of access, human resources, people and culture, and so on.  I would have called it industrial relations, but one may use whatever terminology one chooses.  The HSE board has not traditionally been very hands-on, although it should be.  Is it Mr. Devane's intention that the board will have a proactive role and will assist with issues of access?  It has been 12 years since the moratorium was first introduced and its impact is still being felt to this day.

I will give my view and I am not suggesting for a moment that Mr. Devane shares it. The Government's commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare has been fairly weak.  The appointment is very welcome but the money put towards it indicates there is no massive interest in implementing it, notwithstanding the cross-party support for it.  Sl&aacute;intecare needs to be driven from the very top as will not succeed otherwise.  In the two years since the Sl&aacute;intecare report was published there has been no discernible progress with regard to it.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report did not just call for a shift to the community, which is really important.  It called for the elimination or phasing out, or whatever phraseology we wish to use, of private care from the public health system.  I am interested in Mr. Devane's view of privatisation in the health system, by stealth or by Government policy via the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, or the various other ways the public service is undermined, chipped away and hived off into the private sector.  In my opinion this does not represent good value for money.  I am interested in Mr. Devane's view of private healthcare versus public healthcare.

How we interact with private providers of equipment, pharmaceuticals or clinical services is a key part of that.  From experience, the difficulty arises when the two get muddled up and one is not clear which is which.  Perverse incentives then appear.  It might be unclear, for example, whether an operating theatre is being competed for within a particular institution.  If there is a vision for the end point, we should first ask what gets in the way of delivering great services today.  How can we make the best use of this theatre and what is preventing us from doing that?  I would start with the outcome.

There is something around communicating the vision of the future, the picture of a high-performing, place-based and integrated care model HSE of the future, and giving staff the space to move from here to there.  Previously, there have been great visions but everyone has been running so fast just to cope with day-to-day work that they never get fulfilled.  A part of the issue is ensuring that, if we want to address an issue, we have the structures and approaches that provide people with the time and resources to think their way to the future as opposed to just leaving it as a picture of the future with no path to it.  Sometimes, health organisations are almost too efficient.  Everyone is running around the hamster wheel so quickly just to cope with the peaks in demand that there is no space to move.  People, in particular health professionals, are motivated when they can see how improvement is happening and they are not just coping with day-to-day work.  If we can help with that, it will form part of the work.<\/p> <p>  I am into integrated, place-based healthcare so that the link between community and acute in terms of public health, physical health and mental health is tight.  The real improvements will not take place in performing a unit operation slightly better.  It is great if a unit performs a surgery a little better, but the real benefit for the future will be in terms of how the community links to acute, how we ensure that mental health services are involved at the right time and how the support package is delivered.  That is how we get into the prevention and integrated side.  The thinking behind community health organisations, CHOs, regional integrated care organisations, RICOs, and hospital groups rather than individual hospitals is directionally correct.<\/p> <p>  As to whether I see the board having budgetary responsibility, the answer is \"Yes\".  We must provide the best possible healthcare for the money available.  We cannot spend money that we do not have.  Getting to that kind of financial predictability would allow us to, for example, tell people that we wanted to implement the next tranche of Sl&aacute;intecare and that they could trust us in our budget estimates, since our budget had come in where we said it would.  That is a place that we are not at currently but that we must reach.  How else can we reassure people that we will land a very complex system on a postage stamp if we have not already demonstrated something like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Multi-annual budgets would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#H00300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>They would be very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for appearing before us.  I wish Mr. Devane well in the job that lies ahead.  It is a challenging job at a challenging time.<\/p> <p>  I have been critical of the performance of the HSE since it was first instituted.  That criticism was warranted, as we have not had a seamless and smooth system of delivery of services to patients, who are the people who matter.  Notwithstanding that, we have the fourth or fifth highest level of expenditure on health among OECD countries.  We need to reach a point of being able to ensure value for money, effectiveness and efficiency in our service.  Sl&aacute;intecare will do that, provided that we can achieve it.<\/p> <p>  Previously, my concern was that the HSE was remote from some of the institutions over which it had control in terms of the delivery of services.  Similarly, many HSE staff throughout the regions and at its centre were unsure about where they were supposed to be going, what they were supposed to do, who their bosses were, at what stage they should use their initiative and at what stage it might be dangerous to use their initiative.  I have been concerned about this from the beginning.  I used to be a member of a health board, and the health boards were the opposite in that regard.  They were abolished because politicians were involved.  That was a woefully wrong decision.  Events have since proven that my conclusion was correct.  The exclusion of politicians took away from the institutions of the health services the support that came from local politicians and the responsibility that was forced on same by being in a position of authority.  There were two sides to the story.  There is an issue for the board to deal with in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There is now a single board for the whole country.  I still have my doubts about that.  The extent to which the board can extend its remit to the furthest extreme of the HSE's institutions and realm will be very important.  That has not happened in the past.  I asked the board's first chief executive whether he believed that the proposed structure was the appropriate method of delivering health services to a population the size of Ireland's, having regard to its geography rather than to the situation obtaining in the greater Manchester area, which was the comparison at the time.<\/p> <p>  We will all give Mr. Devane the support he deserves in trying to do a job that has been very challenging in recent times.  Everyone blames everyone else.  That is the problem, but it is the nature of the game.  We have a responsibility.  If we are spending a great deal more money comparatively speaking than many of our colleagues across Europe, we must be able to say that we are at least on par with their average.  We cannot be behind.  That is the challenge and I wish Mr. Devane well in it.

One of the matters that we will be considering is the question of how, when we achieve integrated care regionally and locally, we ensure engagement with communities, public and local stakeholders, including politicians.  That is right.  This is the other side of transparency.  We must be able to get and listen to feedback as well communicate what is happening and what is or is not possible.  The principle of subsidiarity is important in that regard.  My vision for the HSE is not one of everything coming up to the centre and then going back down again.  Rather, it is about how to enable the local organisations to work well together and deliver the best possible healthcare locally while also ensuring that everything adds up.

We have a very unsatisfactory situation with regard to mental health services and provision.  There has been a huge reduction in the spend in this area as a percentage of the overall health budget versus what we spent in the 1980s or even ten years ago such that are issues of real concern around mental health in particular.

How we do the catch-up is the issue.  Some very good work was done across the water around mobilising the mental health charities, working with collaboration with the health service, to change the social perspective on mental health.  What we learned through that work was that the issue was pre-clinical rather than clinical services.  Where there is early intervention there is less need for the psychologist, the psychiatrist or the mental health services later on.

I saw this work very effectively in the mental charities in the UK, specifically England.

I have a number of specific questions about what has occurred over the past four to five years and how the chairman sees it going forward from now.  I refer to employment in the HSE.  The number of people employed in the HSE has gone up by 15,954 people since December 2014.  That is a 15.48% increase.  I am concerned about such a large increase in staff in any organisation because one would imagine that there would have to be a strategy around what needed to be prioritised, what needed to be planned for and how this could be funded into the future.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the increase in managerial and administration staff.  There has been a 15% increase overall in the entire HSE staffing levels over the past four years and three months but the number of staff employed in administration and management has increased by 24%.  It has gone up from 15,112 to 18,751.  That is an increase of 3,639 in four years and three months.  The increase in front-line staff such as nursing has only been 11%.  To me, that suggests there is no strategy.  I do not understand why there has to be an increase of 24% over four years and three months in administration and management.  Will the board set out a strategy to look at the issue of employment within the HSE to examine where we have a surplus and excess numbers and where we have shortages?  It appears that whoever shouted the loudest got the staff and I am concerned about that.  If one looks at those 15,954 extra staff, that costs &euro;650 million a year at a rough estimate.  That will not disappear in the morning; it will be an ongoing cost into the future.  What will be the board's role in setting targets and achievements?<\/p> <p>  The second issue I have with the HSE is with no one wanting to take responsibility for decisions.  I have learned of an incident where a particular issue arose in a particular HSE facility.  The person who was in charge of the incident reported it to the person who was overall manager and the overall manager felt it was necessary to go up the line in the HSE, almost all the way to the top, for a situation that was well under control.  About three or four other people from the administration side got involved in decisions being made on the medical side.  It does not make sense to me that even though the person who was the overall manager of the particular unit was in charge, that person felt that they did not have the capacity to oversee the process that was ongoing.  That sounded to me as though the big problem within the HSE is that no one seems to be able to make a decision and that it must go up along the line all the time.  That is causing huge delays and frustrations in making decisions.  How can Mr. Devane focus on trying to change that type of approach to dealing with issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#K00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>We want to understand the people strategy, the numbers and the recruitment.  We want to make sure we recruit people we can afford, not those we cannot afford, and that we recruit people who we need rather than those we might not need or where there may be another way of doing it.  We will ask ourselves if we have the right people strategy for the HSE.  There is always a temptation to fix an issue by hiring another body, whereas actually it could be possible to ask an existing staff member to solve that issue.  We will ask the executive to outline what our overall people strategy is to make sure we have the right skills, people and pipeline in place because workforce is a major issue in most jurisdictions, the roles are changing so quickly and the specialisms are changing so quickly that it is difficult to even catch up.<\/p> <p>  I recognise what the Senator is saying about accountability in the example he has given.  We have to create an environment where a unit manager feels that he or she owns the whole problem and can make the right decision, that he or she has the support behind him or her and can access the expertise if he or she needs to but does not need 15 other people to meet and discuss it.  That is often what patients want.  They want someone to take on their issues.  People respect that and we have to give our staff the confidence that they will be supported to make the right decisions.  This goes back to the issue of learning and safety.  Across all health systems, we hear time and again that complaints come in, not because people just want to complain but because they want to be heard, they want someone to listen to them and they want to make the process better for the next person to come through the system.  A lot of that comes down to individual accountability and empowerment.  Those two go together and then we must support people to make the right decisions.  On the odd occasion that something goes wrong, it is not about blame but about learning so that it is less likely to happen the next time.  As a cultural intervention, there is something in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>On the 24% rise in administration and management staff-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#K00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562108400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I would need to look into the notes on that to be honest.

As a prelude to that, I want to pick up on some of the things Mr. Devane said.  First, however, I wish him the very best.  Deputy Kelly said he was sorry for Mr. Devane's troubles but they are troubles that belong to all of us if what the HSE is doing does not work, particularly those of us who need health services.  That is the bottom line.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Devane referred to making clinical governance great.  What about social care governance?  The HSE must continue to improve health outcomes for the public in the future and give staff space to work with as distinct from just coping with demand.  We cannot spend money we do not have.<\/p> <p>  In reply to a question from Senator Mullen, Mr. Devane stated that charities can set a tone and expectations.  Mr. Devane referred to collaboration between the HSE and the voluntary charitable sector and indicated that much can be done there.  He also spoke about looking for a mechanism by which to bring more patient voices into consideration.  I think I am reflecting what Mr. Devane said fairly decently.  He also made some comments following Senator Mullen's contribution about the mental health sectors.  There were references to safe service within the budget.  When Mr. Devane was talking about the time he spent working for Macmillan Cancer Support, he indicated that the best &euro;1 million it spent was on data and understanding the needs of the patient.  There is a whole range of chronic conditions to consider.<\/p> <p>  This committee had the new chief executive, Mr. Paul Reid, before it two weeks ago.  He brought with him the memo he had issued to his staff on 14 June.  The simple message was that holding the line on the budget is sacrosanct.  We must build up the trust and confidence of our funders, of those who need the services right now and all of us who will need them one day.  Everyone needs that assurance.<\/p> <p>  There are governance quandaries in respect of these things and that is the point to which I am coming.  Mr. Devane is not the provider, he is the head of the governance structure that is there to provide the services.  I am trying to pick between the two of them and not unnecessarily drag Mr. Devane into questions about what he is doing in respect of this and that.  There is a distinction between being provider and commissioner.  We had a system, in the early 2000s, in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, whereby the commissioners and health boards were the providers.  It was thought that was not necessary.  <\/p> <p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities includes a whole section on mental health and it has now been agreed that this will be implemented by Ireland.  There are governance elements to that convention and the political conundrum relates to the interpretation of what is  \"urgent\" and what is \"critical\".  I am not against strong lobbies but our bodies work when and if we have balance between different elements.  How is there balance, appreciation and an appropriate weighting between the strong, established, powerful areas and other areas which need advocacy and support?  Mr. Devane touched on this when he was talking about mental health but which organisations and groups can be of assistance outside of the health area, where one would prefer to be starting?  We need governance that is beyond regulatory compliance.<\/p> <p>  That is a medley of the issues.  How will Mr. Devane, as chairman, and the board manage all of those competing pressures and tensions, and the lack thereof in some places?  The edict to hold the budget applies to people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, anyone and everyone.  We will wait while one service provider earns the respect of other public bodies.  I find that unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#L00600","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>That was a very short question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#L00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Indeed.

Senator Dolan is absolutely right to ask about the people who do not have a voice and are not heard.  We need to be very alive to that in the manner in which the HSE, more broadly, and the board, in particular, engage.  People across the health sector traditionally use the example of the power of the acute hospital at the expense of its community equivalent, or the power of the physical health lobby over the mental health lobby and so on.  We need to be acutely aware of that.<\/p> <p>  One solution, of course, is that many of the things we need to do are common.  I will give another example from my past.  One thing which worked very affectively in my Macmillan Cancer Support days was establishing a group of ten charities which covered multiple conditions.  Of course, every time Macmillan talked to the Department and said it wanted an early diagnosis for cancer, the Department would say that it could not give it to Macmillan alone and that if it gave an early diagnosis to us, it would have to give it to everyone because otherwise it would be discriminatory.  However, when we then went in as ten organisations and identified a common theme of early diagnosis, whether for diabetes, mental health, multiple sclerosis, cancer or whatever, people paid attention.  One could partly get one's head around the problem and decide to focus on early diagnosis across all conditions.  We then came in behind that as what was known as the Richmond Group of Charities.<\/p> <p>  There are ways of doing it if one leaves one's tribal hat out of the equation.  I tried very hard to be seen not as a cancer chief executive but as a health chief executive.  My colleagues in the British Heart Foundation and the Neurological Alliance tried to do the same thing.  We all tried to say that while, of course, we had to fight for our constituency, we were much more likely to be heard if we worked collaboratively.  That is one answer.<\/p> <p>  On the question on respecting the budget, we must respect the budget and cannot spend money that has not been allocated by the Government and the Oireachtas.  We should not be doing that.  We should be ensuring we spend that budget as effectively as possible.  The settlement between last year and this year was good.  We will travel to the end of this year optimistic about the settlement for next year but we want the credibility of telling the Government which gave us that money that we spent it brilliantly and did not spend money that was not given to us.  We could then ask the Government to fund other things as well, whether Sl&aacute;intecare, addressing a shortage of clinical mental health staff or whatever.  We cannot surprise the Department or the Government by saying that we went off and spent more than the amount allocated to us.  We are coming off a graph that is going up in any event.  That is about us having a financial grip on things that would give the Oireachtas confidence that, if something is funded, the money will be spent well and money we do not have will not be spent.  I hope that will allow the Oireachtas to state that it wants to give the HSE more money because it did a good job with the money it was allocated.<\/p><p> From the experience last year, we should not be in a position of coming up with a supplementary budget with a gap larger than in most jurisdictions with much larger budgets and populations, both in terms of a percentage gap and an absolute gap.  We have a job to do that must be done in a way that does not damage the fundamental interests of the patient or service user.  That is our challenge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Devane.

It is important to note that demand and demographics will always push the graph up, at least in the short term until the improvements to health over a lifetime bear fruit. We have a huge issue with the cost of drugs, including orphan drugs, and with pressure where, as Senator Dolan noted, those who shout the loudest get the most.  I am greatly concerned that where we have a very robust system of authorising drugs, sometimes there is political pressure or those who have the loudest voice lead to exemptions being made, over others who require other medication or treatment who have no voice.  The key to success is ring-fencing or some control on drugs spending annually, so that when the money is gone, it is gone.  That has to be balanced with the pharmaceutical companies knowing how much money is in the basket to start with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#M00900","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Our Minister is waiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070300002#M01000","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I am only four minutes in.

Why would one want to implement that?<\/p> <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy about layers of administration.  We are going to examine this soon, and will ask if it is a question of subsidiarity, how do we get accountability as close to the front line as possible and how we support individuals, as Deputy Durkan noted.  There is the question of remoteness.  We must ensure that the HSE is neither some small body in Dr. Steevens' Hospital or some remote behemoth that sits over the people who do the work.  That is really important.  It is not a structural problem; it is one of communication, transparency, motivation and vision.<\/p> <p>  On pharmaceuticals, I understand there is a big push on biosimilars, which will address part of that.  Keeping control of the drugs budget, while providing the drugs when needed, is a big challenge.  The healthcare system has more people, living longer with more conditions and improving treatment, which is more expensive.  The drivers of health inflation built into it, which is a problem of success, is very real.  Health systems will never be cheaper because of that driver but they must be more effective.  They must be more prevention-based, community-based and early intervention-based.

Amendment No. 1 ensures that women who opted to participate in the review by the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, but whose slides had not been located by the laboratories ahead of the review's deadline have the opportunity to access the tribunal.  This is a sensible and prudent amendment.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are from Deputies Donnelly and Kelly, respectively.  I understand what the Deputies are trying to do, but I have yet to find a way of achieving it.  This is something that we may need to continue discussing and engaging on ahead of Report Stage.  Originally, we all wanted to establish an alternative process to court for the 221 Plus group.  We asked an eminent judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan, to do some work on designing that pathway.  He reverted with the substance of what is effectively the legislation before us.  In addition, we decided that it would be sensible to include those who had opted to participate in the RCOG review.  For understandable reasons, Deputies Donnelly and Kelly are asking in these amendments that we broaden the Bill beyond that to other categories of women.  Deputy Donnelly's amendment asks us to find a mechanism to include women who said they did not wish to participate in the RCOG review but who now wish to access the tribunal.  The challenge facing me is that the RCOG review is independent in the first instance and the deadline for participation set by it has now passed.  From memory, it was 7 June, but it was certainly in June.  The review of this sensitive matter is due to report and is eagerly awaited by many women and their families.  I have yet to find another mechanism whereby those who have not had an audit, be it the RCOG or CervicalCheck audit, could be audited.  We all understand that, if we were to find another process, it would have to be of a quality and standard with which we would be satisfied.  My fear is that finding such a process would delay the passage of this much-needed legislation, which I would like to see passed by the summer recess so that the tribunal can begin its work in the autumn.<\/p><p>Like Mr. Justice Meenan, I view this tribunal as a potential template for examining clinical negligence issues in future.  He is undertaking a body of work on tort reform in general.  I do not imagine that this is the last time we will be legislating in this area.  Perhaps it is something that we will be able to return to, but I cannot currently find a way to broaden the scope that would be acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019070300002#A00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Regarding the Minister's amendment, I am happy with the inclusion of those women.  I will outline the purpose of amendment No. 2.  The women who will be eligible to participate in the tribunal in the first instance are those in the 221 Plus group.  There is a second group comprising the 2,000 or so women who were on the National Cancer Registry as having been diagnosed with cervical cancer but about whose diagnoses CervicalCheck was not told.  Those women were offered an audit to be carried out by the RCOG in the UK.  Approximately half said \"Yes\".  Under the Bill, those 1,000 women have access to the tribunal, but what about the other 1,000 who said \"No\"?  They said \"No\" without knowing that, in doing so, they were losing access to the tribunal.  We do not know how many would have said \"Yes\" if they had been told that a tribunal was on the way and that, in order to access it, they would need to participate in the review, but it is reasonable to believe the number to be more than zero.  If they had been told that the tribunal would be limited to a certain set of women, and knowing that the RCOG was the recognised independent body whose evidence the tribunal could use, a number of those 1,000 women would inevitably have liked to participate in its review.  That is what my amendment seeks to allow.<\/p> <p>  I take the Minister's point that the RCOG review is independent and the deadline for involvement has passed.  Will he and his officials find a way for this other group of women to be offered participation in a view, be it by the RCOG, CervicalCheck or an authority or expert group in France, Germany or wherever?  Let us assume that, of the 50% who did not say \"Yes\", one in five would now do so in light of this new knowledge about the tribunal.  Is there another body that could handle a few hundred reviews in a reasonably short time?  Obviously, the reviews would, like the RCOG's, need to be of the highest quality and fully independent.  Let us ensure that those women are made the offer.  Maybe the body would be the French or German equivalent of the RCOG.  It could be any international group that is deemed appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to move and withdraw my amendment, but does the Minister agree with its principle?  Does he accept that the 1,000 women who said \"No\" should be made the offer if an RCOG-type review for them to undergo can be found?  They said \"No\" not knowing about the tribunal.  If he agrees with that principle, will he commit to tasking the Department with trying to find a mechanism to let that happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019070300002#A00700","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I will respond to one point.  Otherwise, we would be doubling up.  My amendment is similar to Deputy Donnelly's.  It does the same thing, more or less, just written in a different way.  I welcome the Minister's amendment.  It is very good and was suggested by me and others, so I am glad that the Minister has taken it on board.  I remember the day when he walked into the D&aacute;il after a good bit of probing and we found out about the extra 1,000 or more women affected by the disconnect between CervicalCheck's records and those of the National Cancer Registry.  We have gone through <i>ad nauseam<\/i>how in the name of God that happened.<\/p><p>The Bill is too restrictive in terms of which women can participate.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, I have concerns about this legislation and I am not sure I would recommend that somebody use this tribunal as it is currently constituted.  I say this having gained a lot of knowledge from discussions with patient representatives, who would also not necessarily advocate it at this time.  In principle, we all want the tribunal to work and to be effective but we have to make sure that women and their families see it as the best route, and that it is as inclusive as possible.<\/p><p>  My amendment states: \"In page 6, lines 34 and 35, to delete \"as part of the retrospective CervicalCheck cytology clinical audit\" and substitute \", whether as part of the retrospective CervicalCheck cytology clinical audit or otherwise\".\"  A cohort of women, as the previous speaker said, are outside this and have been almost blindsided by the fact that they could have been advised not to go through the RCOG review, for many different reasons.  Because they did not go through it, they now do not have access.  That cannot happen and we have to find a solution.  They have to have the option.<\/p><p> The tribunal does not have to be held up because of this, though the Minister said what he said for the right reasons.  Will it be held up in any case, on account of the appeal of the Ruth Morrissey judgment?  I disagree with this and I have spoken at length on the matter.  There is now a window to deal with this issue because it is likely that the judgment will not be made until the autumn.  We can pass the legislation but we can do so with amendment, whether it is mine or Deputy Donnelly's or, indeed, something the Minister proposes with which we can agree.  A mechanism will have to be found in the current vacuum, which has been created by the Ruth Morrissey case, to deal with the women who are outside the process.  We do not have an option in this regard.  This has to happen.  We need a mechanism to put into the Bill and the women in question need to be written to and given the opportunity, with a deadline of course.

In response to Deputy O'Connell, we need to be sure not to second-guess why women chose not to engage with the RCOG process.  For a lot of people, their cancer journey may have ended a number of years ago and they may now be in very good health and not wish to have an independent review.  The figure I have shows that 63% of women on the cancer registry consented to the RCOG review.  That means 37% did not.  The Deputy is correct that this was for a variety of reasons.  Nobody chose to enter the RCOG process as a passport to the tribunal because nobody knew about the existence of the tribunal.  They chose to do it to exercise the option of an independent external review of their screening history and a determination, if there was discordance.  Some women decided they would like that while others decided they would not.  I do not have the reasons for women making different decisions but we can, at a human level, guess them.  Different people are at different stages in terms of health and well-being and their family life.  The Deputy makes a fair point, however, and nobody wants to be unfair.  I would guess that the number is relatively small because nobody in this room would be able to tell me how many of the 37% have changed their minds and would now like an independent review.  Of those, only a proportion will have a discordance and be able to enter the tribunal.  Access to the tribunal is based on a finding of discordance from either RCOG or the retrospective CervicalCheck audit.  I have not done the maths but I would imagine that the number of women involved is quite small.  This heightens the argument to deal with it.  I cannot deal with it on the floor of a committee meeting and members are not asking me to do that.<\/p> <p>  The RCOG review is independent and it is now closed.  It is important that it moves on to reporting in the autumn because a lot of women are waiting for it and no one wants to delay it.  I will reflect on the issue and engage further with the committee between now and Report Stage, which is a short window, to see if there is a way of dealing with it, either in this legislation or by way of a commitment to return with a proposal shortly.  We need to be careful in terms of scope and not to create other inequities by trying to be fair.  Today, a woman will go for a smear but there is no audit under way because one of the Scally recommendations was for a new audit.  The tribunal cannot be an ongoing process that lasts forever.  Patients said that they want it to be timely, time-limited and scope-limited.  We should not broaden it too much and we have a broader Bill relating to clinical negligence, which is more extensive legislative work for us to do.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to work with members and colleagues to put forward amendments to deal with this.

The Statute of Limitations continues to apply in terms of access to the courts, so obviously it is the same Statute of Limitations as for anybody else and as for any other issue, which is two years from the cause of action.  In regard to the tribunal, when we asked Mr. Justice Meenan to do his work, one of the things that came back from the report, and from his engagement with patients and others, was that this should be more timely, more efficient and more speedy than the court system.  We have tried to time-limit this tribunal so women can get answers quicker and we have picked a figure of nine months.

If the tribunal says, for a variety of reasons it cannot help a woman involved or the tribunal says it cannot take the case, what the Deputy is suggesting is that there should be a period of extra time in addition to the Statute of Limitations to allow a woman to talk to her lawyer and her family and consider the issue.  I think that is right.  We might not agree on this entirely and the six months might be too long for different reasons.  I need to engage with colleagues on that.

Cancer recurs and, unfortunately, statistically in many cases it recurs within a short period.  The first five years are the biggest risk.  It can happen later but within five years is common.  If a woman takes her case to the courts, she knows there will be finality to the decision and if she suffers a recurrence later on, that will be it.  That is the court system and she will not be compensated.  That is unavoidable in court but it is not unavoidable at a tribunal and we have precedent for it.  Statutory provision is being made for a new type of forum, that is, the tribunal operating to the practice and procedure of the High Court but free to make its own rules.  It provides for cross-examining witnesses and a range of other measures. Why can it not provide, as the hepatitis C tribunal did, for all awards to be made as interim awards so if that if the cancer recurs, the woman can return?  Unfortunately, in this scenario there will be cases where health outcomes will deteriorate significantly and those women will be locked out of seeking further damages at the tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019070300002#D00300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I have tabled amendment No. 14.

In the hepatitis C case, from memory, which is vague at this stage as it was a long time ago, everybody had the right to go through the tribunal first and if people were not satisfied, they had the right to go to court.  Some conflict arose because advice was given to some of the patients that they should not go to the tribunal but directly to court.  That caused a problem.  The intent was to speed up processing the cases so the people directly affected could have some recognition of their condition and compensation for it.  We must remember it was very similar in the sense that time was passing and there was constant worry.  From memory, it did not work out exactly as was intended but it did resolve the most immediate problems, in the sense that it could not have been stated the cases were ignored; the first part of them was dealt with in any event.  In some cases, the next part took on a longer life and was more difficult to resolve.

Deputy O'Connell often does so on these matters as she is well informed.  In fairness to Deputies Kelly and Smith, they both said very openly the intent of the amendments is to replicate the hepatitis C compensation tribunal.  My starting point on this, which I believe we would all acknowledge, is that this matter is very different from hepatitis C.  For hepatitis C, no adjudication was required with regard to the medical facts.  We, as a State, infected women.  We bought contaminated blood.<\/p><p>As a State, we had a duty to mind and care for them throughout their lives and try to right the wrong done.  As their needs, including their health needs, changed, the tribunal continued to be able to make various orders and payments.  The proposed tribunal is of a kind we have never established before in the history of the State.  It is an adjudicative tribunal.  The hepatitis C compensation tribunal recognised that the actions of the State had made people ill.  That is not the case in the current circumstances.  In the current circumstances people were let down owing to non-disclosure in the first instance.  In some instances there may be negligence but not in all.  I have heard patient representatives and their solicitors publicly acknowledge that not every case will relate to negligence, that some will reflect the limitations of screening.  In that sense, it is more complex.  However, I accept fully the <i>bona fides<\/i>of Deputies Kelly and Br&iacute;d Smith in what they are endeavouring to do.  It is an important issue, on which I have taken advice and I am happy to take more.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Kelly hit on something important in referring to the rules and procedures of the tribunal, on which I might touch.  The advice I have been given - the legal advice and the advice from the tribunal - is that the judge can and will take into consideration the medical evidence related to the risk of recurrence, future health and well-being.  The tribunal will not be considering only the impact on the person today, it will also be able to take into account medical evidence and have its own experts.  That is another difference by comparison with the High Court.  The judge will have her own experts, not just the experts for both sides in considering the risk of recurrence.  That is important.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Kelly has stated there are rules and procedures set out for every tribunal that point to the general principles to be applied.  I have to be very careful and state I do not write the rules.  The tribunal is obviously independent, but perhaps the rules and procedures can make it very clear that the risk of recurrence and future health will be considered and assessed by the tribunal when it makes an award.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Kelly qualified it in his last intervention in talking about a time limit.  If we were to accept the amendments as read today, or versions thereof, we would effectively be committing, as the Oireachtas, to the ongoing maintenance of a tribunal.  If the Oireachtas wants to do that, it is very different from what we started out to do.  We started out, through the Meenan report, with a time-limited and scope-limited and an efficient way for women to obtain answers, justice and, where there was wrongdoing, payment.  We would be moving into a very different space if we were talking about the ongoing maintenance of a tribunal in the way the hepatitis C tribunal has been maintained for many years.<br\/><br\/>My final point is a key one and members might not welcome my making it.  This is a voluntary process.  We need both women and the laboratories to participate.  Either side can decide it does not wish to participate.  It would be very different if we were asking laboratories to participate in a process that would be ongoing forevermore.  I do not want to pass legislation that looks like I am providing an alternative to the court to find out that it will not work in reality.  We did not have that complication with the hepatitis C tribunal which just involved the State and its citizens.  In this instance we have different parties, including some external to the State.  They have a choice as to whether to participate.  It is voluntary and legally has to be so.

The facts of the Scally report are evident for all to see and accepted.  My bona fides are very clear and understood by those directly affected.  That is what is most important to me in that regard.<\/p> <p>  What I have said - it is a statement of medical fact - is that the infection of people by contaminated blood by the State is very different from what occurred owing to the limitations of screening, whereby, in some cases, there are false positives and false negatives.  This is all documented clearly in the Scally report.  One can bring in any medical expert one wants to confirm that there are false negatives and false positives.  In some cases, however, there is negligence, but there is a very big difference between a false negative and negligence.  The reason the tribunal has to be adjudicative rather than compensatory is somebody needs to establish and adjudicate on whether there has been negligence or a false negative.  That is the role of the judge, supported by experts.  In his report Mr. Justice Meenan outlines seven or eight reasons he believes this is a more compassionate or better approach than that of the courts system.  He does not use these words, but I do.  He arrived at his point after meeting many people, including Dr. Scally and patient representatives.  It is not a perfect model, but I do not believe there is one because of the complexities involved.  I will not pretend it is a perfect model because it is not, but it is a better one or certainly an alternative to court.  I do not believe this is a replica of the hepatitis C issue or that the tribunal replicates the hepatitis C tribunal.  It is not the same legally.  The hepatitis C tribunal was compensatory, while this one is adjudicative.  It has to establish whether there was negligence.

The purpose of this amendment is to provide protection to women as they are being cross-examined.  Much of the genesis of this tribunal was a very real concern for the trauma which the women were going through in the High Court.  The Taoiseach promised that no women would have to go to court again and there was a strong reaction among the public to how women were being treated in some cases.  Maybe I am being unfair as I did not see the proceedings and am only going on reports, but I understand that women were being asked very personal questions about their past sex life, almost in a victim shaming line of questioning.  By asking a woman who has cervical cancer about her sex life, presumably the implication is that it is partly her fault.  The public reaction and the reaction in the Oireachtas to that was very strong.  Women should not be subjected to this kind of questioning.  One thing which the tribunal achieves is that it brings the matter into private session so that at least women who want to use the tribunal who do not wish to answer such questions in public may do so in private.<\/p><p>The second part is the process of questioning itself.  In the High Court, a judge can make an award for aggravated damages based on how a witness is cross-examined.  A judge might find in favour of the person being cross-examined on the basis that he or she believes there was negligence and the judge may award a certain sum.  On top of that, the judge may make a second award based on how the witness was treated under cross-examination.  It might be asked then why bother restating, to an extent, a power that is already there.  It is to underscore one of the core principles of the tribunal.  Negligence is being established and the labs and the State have the right to defend themselves, of course.  By referencing aggravated damages for unnecessarily aggressive or adversarial cross-examination, however, as opposed to just saying that the rules of the High Court apply, a point is being made in the legislation that while parties may cross-examine and have the right to defend themselves in the case of negligence, they should be very aware that the treatment of these women is front and centre in the mind of the tribunal.  That is why it is there rather than just accepting that it is part of the normal powers of a High Court judge.  It is stated explicitly because while the tribunal, by definition, achieves one of the aims, which is to move from public to private session, another core aim is to provide a respectful way of making these cases, although it may still be robust.  That is why it is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019070300002#G00600","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1562108400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I am fully aware of the substance of what Deputy Donnelly seeks to do with the amendment.

I have also seen some court cases and rulings where aggravated damages have been awarded based on the conduct of the wrongdoer or his or her representative in defence of the claim of the wronged plaintiff.

It is critical that the right level of legal representation be covered.  We have sat in courtrooms in which the legal aid barrister has stood up to consult the client for the first time for approximately ten seconds before defending him or her before the judge.  That is not the sort of free legal aid about which we are talking in this case.  This process will require solicitors and may require senior or junior counsel.  The level of legal representation should be appropriate to allow the women concerned have proper legal teams and legal cases made.
