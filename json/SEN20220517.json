The Minister is very welcome to the House for this very important debate.  As the Cathaoirleach said, today, 17 May, marks the 48th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  As he said, I attended a wreath laying ceremony earlier today on Talbot Street, along with the Taoiseach, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alison Gilliland, and the cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Councillor Aidan Campbell, along with many others.  It was a very poignant event.<\/p> <p>Every year, we gather here to discuss this issue, but unfortunately little or no progress or forward movement is being seen for the victims, survivors and their families.  Some 33 people lost their lives in Monaghan and Dublin on 7 May 1974.  It was the greatest loss of life in one single day during the entire Troubles.  As the anniversary occurs today, our thoughts and prayers are very much with the victims and their families.<\/p> <p>It is very difficult and frustrating to try to understand how, 48 years on, the hunt and search for the truth and justice for the tragedy in which 33 people lost their lives, seven in County Monaghan and 26 in Dublin, as well as for the 300 people who were injured, is still going on.  We can only imagine the pain they have had to endure as a result.  That pain, unfortunately, is compounded today in many ways by the fact that, 48 years on, they are still waiting for the truth of what happened on that fateful day.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to all of the families who have worked tirelessly to try to lift the lid on what happened.  I also pay tribute to the Justice for the Forgotten group led by Margaret Urwin, which has campaigned vigorously to find out the truth, as well as Members in this House and the Lower House, including the Minister, who have also campaigned to find out the truth.<\/p> <p>For years, we have pointed the finger at the British Government for its agencies' refusal to hand over any documentation whatsoever.  There was some light or a bit of hope with families in recent times with Operation Denton and an investigation carried out by John Stalker, a former chief constable, regarding what happened.  It is heartening that the British entities we have pointed the finger at, and rightly so, for many years for refusing to hand over documentation, namely, MI5, the PSNI and the Ministry of Defence, have now handed it over.<\/p> <p>It is deeply worrying, and very sad and frustrating, for the families to learn that the obstacle or blockage now rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand it is a legal interpretation of the terms of reference which it signed off on 12 or 18 months ago.  Instead of referring to Operation Denton or the investigation by John Stalker, it is using the term \"inquiry\".  For that reason, it seeks clarity from the Attorney General on what it can and cannot hand over.  That is all very well, but meanwhile the families are still waiting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would appreciate it if the Minister has some news for us regarding what this blockage is and the imperative and urgency with which the Government will seek to alleviate this problem to enable information to be handed over.

I express my and this Government&rsquo;s condolences to the families whose loved ones were killed or injured in the terrible events of 17 May 1974.  Those callous acts will always be remembered as the single deadliest day of the Troubles, where 33 people lost their lives, as the Senator mentioned.  Many others were injured and had their lives changed forever.  It is, frankly, hard to believe on a day like this, when we think of everybody here in Dublin and in other parts of the country going about their daily lives, that so many ordinary people going about their lives on this day in 1974 were so callously and brutally attacked in the way they were.  There were many such incidents of violence on this island during the Troubles.  This was a tragic reality for those caught up in the bombings on 17 May 1974.<\/p> <p>I state clearly the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the victims and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We will persevere in our efforts to seek the truth behind these events and, hopefully, to secure some measure of comfort for the families.  Even though a long time has passed, it is important that we can secure that form of comfort for these family members.  The Government has worked consistently to implement the all-party Oireachtas motions calling on the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all the original documents in its possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We also continue to raise this case regularly with the Government of the UK.  We did this most recently in March at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, raised the Dublin and Monaghan bombings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, and with the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Conor Burns.  Again, the Minister emphasised the need for this matter to be progressed.<\/p> <p>Regarding Operation Denton, at the Senator mentioned, it falls under the general umbrella of the Operation Kenova series of ongoing independent investigations or reviews into the Northern Ireland legacy cases.  It is led by a former chief constable.  Operation Denton is an independent and analytical review into collusion involving the Glenanne gang.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings are included as one of the incidents in Operation Denton.  I must stress that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to co-operating to the greatest extent possible with the Operation Kenova endeavours.  A high-level agreement is already in place that supports co-operation and an exchange of information with the operation investigation team in the context of criminal investigations.  The historical investigation co-ordination unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to support this partnership.<\/p> <p>As the Senator also mentioned, Operation Denton is a distinct strand in the work of Operation Kenova, which is an analytical review rather than a criminal investigation.  It was as a result of this context that it was necessary to request legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General to progress clarification of how co-operation can take place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the lack of a statutory framework for information sharing, co-operation necessarily involves complex legal issues.  Following the receipt of advice from the Attorney General, work is already under way in my Department to establish the necessary mechanisms to allow relevant information to be shared with Operation Denton and it is anticipated that the mechanism should be in place by the summer.  As Minister, I will do everything I can to ensure that mechanism is in place by the summer and that all information that can and should be provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to this process is provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#C00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response.

As a Government, we have consistently raised these issues with our colleagues in the North and with our British Government counterparts.

At the outset I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House and I acknowledge her ambition and that of her Department.  That is why I feel confident that we will get results from this discussion.  I also acknowledge her recent visit to my own constituency.<\/p> <p>I propose to address this issue, in the first instance, by moving from the more particular standpoint to the more general.  I met an informal group of parents in Cavan recently, all of whom were parents of children with disabilities and they made a number of points to me.  I will deal with those and will then deal with the broader objective evidence.  That is not to suggest that these initial points are not also objective but I will deal with the other issues then.  One&rsquo;s heart would be moved by meeting these parents as they are very good people who are concerned for their children and, in some instances, are very distraught.  I spent a good two hours with them.  It was a very moving experience and it would be a disgrace if I was not doing what I am doing now.<\/p> <p>Their first point was that for an initial appointment with Enable Ireland one could be waiting anywhere from six months to two years.  The younger children are seen more quickly in respect of an assessment of needs and are prioritised.  However, if one has an older child in the new progressing disability services for children and young people programme, one could be waiting for three years for any intervention if that child receives a private diagnosis.  The parents made the point, which I distinctly remember, that there was a particular problem if one has had a private diagnosis done, where one might not then get an assessment of needs.  That would be bizarre.<\/p> <p>There is no clear pathway apart from an assessment of needs in order to get the services.  One of the parents said to me that their non-speaking child is waiting nearly three years for a psychology assessment and that their other son is waiting four years in primary care for autism spectrum disorder and occupational therapist assessments.  The child should be seen within three months for initial paperwork and a complete diagnosis should take from six to nine months, if they have the necessary paperwork, for an assessment of needs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A pay gap of &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 exists between those who work in Enable Ireland and the voluntary services, though I know they are section 39 organisations funded by the State, and those in the mainstream HSE, in primary care centres and so on.  The pay anomaly is huge.  We referenced it at a health committee meeting but I want to hear about it today.  Enable Ireland is paid less.  A new deal was sorted for HSE staff but Enable Ireland did not receive the same, as per the management of Enable Ireland.  Enable Ireland does not have the same maternity leave and pension contracts and blames HSE funding for lack of recruitment.  It states there is a lack of recruitment and there should be international recruitment.  It blames the HSE for that.  The day the Minister of State was with us in Cavan, this and some of the other points came up.  The HSE takes months to approve advertisement of vacancies even when aware beforehand that a post needs to be filled.   There is huge bureaucracy that is ridiculous and should not be the case.<\/p><p>I move to some of the surveys and studies.  Inclusion Ireland did a report that scarily stated 85% of children wait for more than a year for appointments and assessments.  Some 1,000 families were surveyed for that.  Down Syndrome Ireland conducted a survey of their parents and 30% of them or 400 families, of whom 44% wait similar lengths.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, said 4,000 children are awaiting an assessment.  All of this makes for a horrendous story.  I am aware of the standard operating procedure that is obviously not implemented yet and of the UN convention.  It is something we could discuss for hours, but neither I nor the Minister of State has the time.  I look forward in her response to getting hope so that I can go back to the parents and tell them she told me this and it will make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#D00500","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this Commencement matter and keeping it on the agenda.  It was fantastic to meet him when I was in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  I commend the teams I met with, both the Enable Ireland team and our HSE team on the ground.  Both gave their time willingly to discuss the issues the Senator has eloquently raised and both said the same.<\/p> <p>One of the issues related to pay, the variation between teams and how difficult it is to recruit into those teams.  The Senator is correct that there is a gap between section 39 workers and section 38 and HSE workers.  It will have to be addressed because if it is not we will not be able to recruit to those teams.  We have teams that have not been fully populated.  That can be seen in Cavan and Monaghan, where there is a 25% vacancy rate.  Pay is part of the reason for that vacancy rate.  It is not the conditions because the conditions include that it is a lovely part of the world to live in.  There are reasons to choose to go there, including purchasing of properties and everything else, and the choice that is available.  At the same time, those people still have to go for a mortgage and are &euro;5,000 down in their pay grade.  They could be on a team with people from the HSE and section 38 organisations who make an extra &euro;5,000 and are sharing the same canteen room.  Of course it is a concern and that is not wasted on me.  I am trying my best to address that matter.  I am addressing it with the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers Supporting People with Intellectual Disability, FEDVOL, and recently had a meeting with Alison Harnett, who represents many section 39 workers.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned long waiting lists being experienced in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  What are we going to do about it?  We need to address international recruitment.  Where the Senator is located on the Border, international recruitment means looking to our neighbours in Northern Ireland and to the qualifications they have for speech and language therapy.  I keep talking about speech and language because it is done in Derry, yet we cannot recruit people qualified in speech and language therapy in Northern Ireland to southern Ireland because there is a component there that CORU does not recognise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an issue I am addressing.  The reason I am addressing it is that perhaps we can recruit and give training on the ground in the piece that is missing.  This could ensure the requirements of CORU are met and at the same time there is on-the-ground training.  This is an open and very live conversation with the HSE.  As I said, international recruitment, along with efforts to increase the HSE's reach into the broader domestic supply market for the non-regulated healthcare workforce, is being used as an approach.  However, there are limitations to international supply as Ireland is a signatory to the WHO global code of ethical recruitment of health workforce.<\/p><p>Technology to support the recruitment process should be used also.  We do not need to go on big trade missions.  We can do a lot on LinkedIn.  We can manage our time very well.  The Senator mentioned Enable Ireland.  The section 39 organisations are far more fruitful in their recruitment.  They have a quicker turnaround.  They can recruit more quickly.  Their process is more streamlined as opposed to taking eight months with the HSE.  It can be done in six to eight weeks in organisations such Enable Ireland.  We need to see why we cannot do it better in the HSE.  If the section 39 organisations are able to recruit so much faster, we should release the posts to them as opposed to having 555 vacant posts nationally as I stand here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#E00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

An agreed outcome of the meeting was that a plan would be developed in the coming six to eight weeks with a number of actions to support the roll-out of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.  I hope this will address some of the matters the Senator has raised.  It is important to note the Government has provided significant funding to the HSE for new posts in recent years to strengthen the capacity of the children's disability network teams throughout the country, including in Cavan and Monaghan.  Since 2019, almost 500 additional whole-time equivalent posts for children's disability services have been allocated.

I thank the Cathaoirleach and Seanad for facilitating this Commencement matter seeking a commencement date for construction of a commemorative site at the national monument on Moore Street.  As everyone knows, Moore Street is the most historic trading street in the city.  It is the birthplace of our Republic.  Despite being rich in history beyond anyone's dreams or what anyone could imagine, the street has been dominated by dereliction, neglect and antisocial behaviour for far too many years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I was first elected to Dublin City Council in 2004.  From even before that time I have worked with relatives, street traders and those who owned properties on the street to encourage the State, in the form of the city council, the Government and all the national bodies, to support the regeneration of the street and its market yet create an adequate and appropriate a commemorative centre at 14 to 17 Moore Street.  I have served on a number of committees and far too many to remember.  In fact, it is too depressing to think about that.  There have been far too many reports with the latest report being delivered to the Minister of State more than a year ago.  It was the third report from the third ministerial advisory committee on Moore Street.  So there has been plenty of talking and consideration given to this issue.  There is no doubt that there is enormous support for a proper commemoration of the historic events that took place on Moore Street.  The report made six recommendations but, more specifically, it made a recommendation on the national monument.  The report specifically endorsed the concept that was proposed by the Irish Heritage Trust that would require State bodies such as the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the National Monuments Service to be engaged to create an imaginative, fitting and appropriate commemorative museum.<\/p><p>Ireland has many examples of great commemorative sites of which we can be very proud but it is shameful the neglect that the State has allowed to take hold on Moore Street.  It is unacceptable.  Everybody appreciates that the majority of the properties in and around the historic site are privately owned.  However, it is impossible for us to be critical of the private owners and the neglect that they have  presided over when the State has failed to take adequate action.  The State must stop dithering, delaying and ignoring the dereliction and deterioration of an historic national monument that is located in the heart of our capital city.  The monument is not just for us in Dublin central or in Ireland; it is for all of the Irish people who descend from our Republic.  I ask the Minister of State to please give us a commencement date for works at the national monument and let us accelerate whatever works can be done because the dereliction that is taking place is shameful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#F00600","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her Commencement matter.

Having been allowed entry into the buildings, they were really quite stunning.  Even in its raw current state, and some enabling works have taken place, the project is impressive.  It is critically important that this important story of our history is told and I agree with the Senator wholeheartedly that we need to move the project forward and not just the national monument but the regeneration of that entire part of the city.  I am not from Dublin and I saw the street for the first time in quite a number of years.  I was shocked to see the deterioration that had taken place in that part of the city and it is incumbent on us all to move forward.<\/p> <p>In March 2021, &euro;121,285,388 was allocated to Dublin City Council in respect of the north inner city concept area 1 under call 2 of the urban regeneration and development fund.

Complementary projects include Moore Street public realm renewal works, with the intention of reactivating one of the most important trading streets in the city, along with structural and restoration works on the national monument at 14 to 17 Moore Street.  Works on the national monument, which is in State ownership, will facilitate the protection and reuse of these historic buildings as an iconic heritage and visitor attraction in the form of a 1916 commemorative centre alongside the rejuvenation of the historic street.  The regeneration of Moore Street market and the street is a matter for Dublin City Council, and I am assured that an expert advisory group was appointed in that regard.<\/p><p>The Moore Street advisory group, of which the Senator was a valued member, recommended in its report to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and me last year that the process embarked on by the OPW and the national monuments service of our Department to restore the national monument and open it up to the public as soon as possible should continue.  Officials from the Department and the OPW have been liaising to progress that.  I understand the OPW is in the process of appointing a team to carry out phase 1 essential works to the monument, which will ensure stability and provide a pathway for the phase 2 completion works at the monument.  I understand this is imminent and I hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks.  The Senator will, I am sure, appreciate that the Minister and I are keen that those essential works commence as soon as possible.<\/p><p>We will make an announcement in the coming weeks.

All of that is really welcome and reflects the Government's understanding of the need in the area.  I welcome that the OPW has indicated it will imminently commence works on the national monument at 14 to 17 Moore Street, but we need the OPW to keep to that commitment, to actually deliver and to demonstrate within the coming weeks that works will commence on the national monument.  The Minister of State is absolutely correct that if the State were to demonstrate its commitment to the street and a real regeneration of the national monument site in the form of a commemorative museum, it would be a vote of confidence not just in our history but also in the future of Moore Street.  It would be a vote of confidence in the street traders and all the businesses in the area and would demonstrate that this Government, unlike previous ones, will actually deliver in a respectful way for our history.

I cannot give a specific date but, certainly, that is our commitment and we are determined to see it through.  The report of the Moore Street advisory group, of which the Senator was a part, presented to us by Dr. Tom Collins, was a very good one and it was universally accepted as the way forward.

This Commencement matter relates to the burning of green waste and, in particular, the derogation he is aware the Minister signed in January or February.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This issue has exercised that committee but it has also exercised farmers across the country.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, traditionally many farmers clear out dykes and ditches and cut debris, branches, timber and so on and then amass or collect this greenery at certain locations, often in fields set in from the roadway network.  As such, they have had a practical issue with getting rid of the waste.  There is a practice, however, of leaving it there and then burning it rather than shredding it.  The Minister of State knows enough about the land to know that in certain circumstances it is not possible to get machinery in, particularly on damp or boggy land.  There has been a long tradition of burning well dried-out vegetation that has been cleared by farmers, and this is a concern.<\/p> <p>This year, it came as a surprise to farmers that the statutory instrument was out of date, but the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, signed a statutory instrument on 9 February 2022.  The purpose of those regulations was to extend until 1 January 2023 an exemption provided for under SI 286\/209 - Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal By Burning) Regulations 2009, which exists to allow farmers to dispose of waste generated from agricultural practices.  The concern is that some people, including farming organisations, thought this new statutory instrument would be in place for three years.  Indeed, I indicated in the wording of the Commencement matter I submitted to the Seanad Office that it would be in place for three years but that did not find its way to the final draft.  In short, there is a concern.  There is an appreciation, albeit with a bit of stress and misunderstanding in the context of communication, that the statutory instrument was signed but farm organisations and small farmers would like to see the derogation extended.<\/p> <p>I do not know what is the plan or feedback.  That is what I am trying to ascertain.  I understand that a review group was established by the Minister to consider the practice of burning green waste and explore alternatives.  Has that review group been established?  Has it met?  What are its timelines for issuing a report?  This is a critically important issue.  It is better to deal with it now than to be surprised.  Let us plan for it and find out who is on the review group, what are its terms of reference and whether there is any feedback in respect of what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#J00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal By Burning) Regulations 2009 make it an offence to dispose of waste by uncontrolled burning.  As an exemption, Article 5 of the regulations provides for the permissible disposal of agricultural waste by burning under certain conditions, including, among others, where the material to be burned consists of uncontaminated wood, trees, tree trimmings, leaves, brush and similar waste.  It should be noted that the exemption only applies to waste generated by agricultural practice and on the strict understanding that such burning is done as a final measure following the application of the waste hierarchy, under which the prevention of waste or its preparation for reuse, recycling or other recovery are preferred options to the disposal or landfilling of waste.  In addition, the relevant local authority must be informed in advance of the intention to burn agricultural green waste.<\/p> <p>An exemption under the legislation has been provided in recent years to allow farmers, as a last resort, to dispose by burning of waste generated by agricultural practices.  SI 51\/2022 - Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) (Amendment) Regulations 2022, published on 11 February, was the fifth such extension to the exemption and will run until 1 January 2023.

The feasibility study will include a literature review of alternative practices internationally carried out in regions comparable with Ireland that are viable, practical and environmentally sustainable.  The study will also include a public stakeholder consultation.  The study, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022, will identify potential alternative measures to burning and the potential benefits and challenges associated with them.  This study will help inform appropriate policy actions to take in order to establish alternative measures to burning on Irish farms.<\/p><p>The issue of air pollution caused by this practice is well established and is addressed in a draft clean air strategy, developed by my Department, which identifies and promotes the integrated actions across government required to reduce air pollution.  The draft clean air strategy, which it is intended will be published later this year, was open for public consultation until 3 May this year.  The final published clean air strategy will provide the high-level strategic policy framework necessary to identify and promote the integrated measures across government policy that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner ambient air while delivering on wider national objectives.  The key strategic priorities of the clean air strategy are as follows: to ensure continuous improvements in air quality across the country; to guarantee the integration of clean air considerations into policy development across government; to increase the evidence base that will help us to continue to evolve our understanding of the sources of pollution in order to address them more effectively; to enhance regulation and improve the effectiveness of our enforcement systems; and to promote and increase awareness of the importance of clean air.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#J00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>As I said, I am a member of the Oireachtas joint committee.

I acknowledge the decision by Cabinet today to proceed with the new national maternity hospital.  It has been a difficult couple of weeks in terms of there being strong views on both sides.  However, it is my strong belief it is the right decision to proceed without any further delay, given we have had nine years of delay already.  I hope developments over the past couple of weeks, given the Minister has been at the Committee on Health and we have had various medical professionals from the current National Maternity Hospital, from Dr. Rhona Mahony to Professor Mary Higgins to Ms Mary Brosnan, and many other clinicians and midwives come out to voice their support, have allayed at least some, if not all, of the concerns of many of those who were on the other side of this argument.  Ultimately, it is the intention of Government to provide a world-class healthcare facility for women and babies at the new site at Elm Park.  Even by getting the go-ahead today and proceeding to the next phase, it will still take us a number of years to deliver this project.  It is expected the hospital will open its doors in 2030. One can understand the urgency to try to get this matter progressed.<\/p> <p>The issue of Brexit remains high on the agenda.  We have seen confirmation from the British Government and Liz Truss that they intend to proceed to table legislation to take unilateral action on the protocol.  It is very disappointing, to put it mildly, that the UK Government would take such a move.  To disapply the protocol unilaterally, even some elements of it, is in breach of an international treaty, which I think we are all blue in the face from repeating time and again to the British Government.  I would welcome a debate in this House at the earliest opportunity with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss where we go from here, what the next steps are and to hear from the Minister what the European Commission intends to do in terms of its reaction to this.  I note the comments of the European Commissioner, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, saying the EU will take action, but we do not know what that actually looks like.  Ultimately, we need to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and we protect our citizens and businesses as best we can, although we have ultimately no control over what the UK Government does.  We are asking that it would act in good faith, but certainly the comments from Ms Truss appear to be to the contrary.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the fantastic work done by a local school in my town of Castlebar, namely, Breaffy National School.

Which systems and responses worked out and which ones did not?<\/p> <p>Last September, An Taoiseach said that he was wary of an official inquiry hamstringing responses to future emergencies, but is it not the opposite?  Would a robust, transparent inquiry not show up any failures or mistakes in our pandemic response and allow us to build on our experience and do better in the future?  It was stated in January there would be an evaluation of the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Can we get an update on it?

Alternatively, will the Covid inquiry be a real one that will drill down into and uncover the inconvenient truths, face up to the hard data and equip future generations with dearly paid-for information on how to handle an international pandemic?

It is unilaterally legislating to amend aspects of the agreed protocol, a protocol that it negotiated and signed up to and that its Parliament endorsed.  We were told that this was an oven-ready deal, that it was about getting Brexit done and that, in fact, Brexit was done.  However, it is now increasingly apparent, even to anyone who was not paying attention, that this is actually about giving cover to the DUP, which spurned every compromise and deal put before it, pushes even yet for the hardest and most disastrous form of Brexit and has refused to re-enter the Stormont institutions and adhere to the will of the people in the North, who just two weeks ago expressed very clearly what they want.  The people want parties around the Executive table and in the Assembly Chamber working for them to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, the problems in the health service and the issues that matter.<\/p> <p>It is encouraging that we have colleagues and friends here from the United States because we need to mobilise international attention on this in the first instance.  We have received a lot of solidarity and goodwill, as the Deputy Leader knows, but we are now in quite a serious predicament owing to what the British Government is seeking to do following its announcement today.  The announcement from Ms Liz Truss this afternoon on the protocol follows on from the announcement this morning that the British Government is to plough ahead with its introduction of an amnesty for British state forces, who are responsible for countless atrocities here in Ireland, North and South.  That should give us cause for deep concern, not least considering that, just a few months ago, this Seanad unanimously rejected the amnesty proposals.  It is important, therefore, that we have the opportunity to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the British Government's announcement today and the measures the Irish Government will take internationally to respond to it, given that it is a breach and a disregarding and walking away from the Stormont House Agreement, which we all signed up to and want to see implemented.  Although that agreement is an imperfect measure, it is one that we all agreed could be the beginning of a process to deal with the issues of legacy and victims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#P00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We learned last week about the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqla.

They protected the dignity of this remarkable woman and they had to endure the most horrendous abuse to do that.<\/p> <p>These actions are the result of a society poisoned by its own racism and militarism.  The Desmond Tutu trust, among others, has drawn attention to the clear parallels to the attacks on the funerals of activists during the apartheid era in South Africa.  The killing of Shireen is a tragedy and an absolute outrage.  It fits into a pattern of Israeli institutions and agents trying to silence and repress those who expose their cruelty to the world.

We all recognise the important role journalists play in protecting the fundamental freedoms of others and holding various different institutions to account.  To see the behaviour of the Israeli forces during the funeral was disgusting and appalling, and should be condemned in every parliament around the world.

It is important that the Government moves without delay to put in place a national aviation policy, something which has not been in place for a long time.  We have seen the growth of Dublin Airport.  I have no problem in principle with having a main airport where the capital city is because that is something that happens in every country.  However, it cannot be at a cost to other areas.  A relatively small number of additional passengers would take Shannon Airport to a critical mass whereby it could attract flights on a more regular basis to key destinations in Europe.  I ask the Acting Leader to have the Minister for Transport come before the House so that we can have a proper and open debate on the importance of regional development, and the growth and necessary input to airports such as Shannon to ensure they can thrive, grow and meet the needs of a balanced country and approach to the dispersal of our population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#R00100","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I am working from a list drawn up by the Cathaoirleach and have added one name.

There should be more flexibility in this area.  If this situation is allowed to continue, this young couple and their three children will go on the housing list, which will create further problems down the road.  Greater flexibility should be exercised, particularly by local authorities, in the context of young people trying to get on the property ladder.  What has happened to this young couple is a disgrace.  The husband has a trade, is working full-time and is earning reasonably good money.

The key ask is that we recognise and understand that we should not be treating Israel as a normal state.  We should recognise and state what the whole world knows to be true, namely, that Israel is an apartheid state.  We need to hear Government Ministers recognise and state that fact.  In all honesty, that is the only way to go from this point onwards.  We cannot keep pretending that somehow Israel is a normal state.  It is anything but and we have seen that with our own eyes in recent days.<\/p> <p>It will not surprise the Acting Leader to hear me raise University Hospital Limerick, UHL, again.  My colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, through a reply to a parliamentary question, discovered that last year 9,000 patients had to wait more than 12 hours for treatment at the hospital.  The exact figure was 8,720.  To give the House an idea of where this is going, in 2013 the figure was 4,000-odd, so it has doubled in less than ten years.  The really terrifying part of this is that a report by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Britain noted that, on average, there is one excess death for every 67 patients who stay in an emergency department for between eight and 12 hours.  Based on the figures from last year, we had 130 additional deaths of patients in our hospital in Limerick.  That is 130 families grieving over people who should not have died but did because of the ongoing chaos and impossible conditions that staff and patients alike are having to put up with.  This has been the case for a decade at this stage and it has got worse, year in, year out and month in, month out.  The promise of additional beds is not enough.  The figure of 92 new beds equates to just 48 new beds.  In reality, we have been waiting at least 18 months for those.  I just cannot understand the lack of action by successive Governments.  The latest news is that the Minister has declared that a specialist team will be deployed to UHL but we do not have any details of the team's remit and its make-up remains very vague.<\/p> <p>At the weekend, I stood with colleagues in Limerick city centre and people were queueing for well over an hour to sign a petition calling for a health emergency to be declared in Limerick.

In a nutshell, this means that between 40 and 50 remote working spaces in the centre of Dundalk town will be open to people to come and use.  I raise this issue because funding for the hub came from the Border enterprise development fund.  One of the stipulations is that the funding must be used to target vacant or derelict buildings in an urban centre.<\/p> <p>Retail is not what it was 20 or 30 years ago.  It has now moved online and there are so many different ways to do it.  We have to reimagine the main streets in our urban centres across the country.  We can do this by getting footfall back on to main streets through developments such as the one I visited today.  Every day, between 40 and 50 people will come to the main street in Dundalk where they will buy breakfast, lunch or meat on their way home.  This is about getting footfall back on the streets.  The way in which retail has moved to online purchase means that it may no longer be able to do this.  While funding is available through the Department of Rural and Community Development for villages and rural areas to turn these spaces into remote working hubs, there is still no clear line of funding to do this in our urban centres.  Dundalk, where I come from, was lucky because it is in a Border area but what about urban centres in the midlands, the west or further down the country?  This is an incredible way to transform our main streets, breathe life back into them and get people back on to them.  It is should be commended and looked at on a much wider scale.<\/p> <p>I pay particular tribute to Sarah Daly and Ciara Breen in Dundalk who have put so much effort into getting this hub over the line.

He is the first active male professional footballer in England to come out since Justin Fashanu did so 30 years ago.  Justin's tragic death has cast a long shadow over professional football.  Ireland is a country of sports lovers and football plays a huge role in that so it is beyond time for us to grab the thorny issue of homophobia in sport and call it out.  The players who represent us in our communities, counties and internationally should feel safe to come out.  I wish Jake the best for the future in his career and life.  I hope his coming out gives hope and comfort to those still living in fear of coming out as their true, authentic selves.  We must show leadership in the House that homophobia, biphobia and transphobia will not be tolerated.<\/p> <p>Students face the ongoing issue of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants being affected by pandemic unemployment payments.  I ask that the Leader to write to the Minister to get onto this issue.  Perhaps the Minister should come into the House to discuss it.  It is unacceptable that students directed to take pandemic unemployment payments for work they lost during Covid are now losing out on SUSI.  I warned this would happen at the time, yet not much was done.  The response from the Minister until now has been that students should just appeal to SUSI, which is not acceptable.  I do not think the Minister and his Department officials have any appreciation of how difficult it is for students to have the rug pulled out from under them like this.  It is not fair to penalise people for taking pandemic unemployment payments and then expect them to go through a complex appeals process.  I would like the Leader to write to the Minister on this as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#U00600","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It is great to see Senator Buttimer back in the Leader's chair.  It suits him.  He looks great.  There has been huge reaction in the Chamber today and throughout the sporting pages in respect of the fact that 17-year-old Jake Daniels has come out as the first professional gay football player since Justin Fashanu and only the second in the world.  As a 17-year-old he is to be commended.  He signed professional papers and made his debut in the past month.  It is a very brave thing to do.<\/p> <p>Where are we in our country in this debate?  I think of my fellow countyman, David Gough, the top GAA intercounty referee in Ireland and the first referee in Ireland to come out as openly gay.  In the past year he has done a significant amount of promotional work throughout Ireland.  He came out in 2015.  He said it has been disappointing that nobody has found the courage to come out since then.  He has gone on to referee all-Ireland finals and it has had no impact on his career.  He has expressed disappointment that the Pride flag has yet to be flown over Croke Park, the home of Gaelic games.  He said the GAA will ultimately regret not making this gesture sooner.<\/p> <p>There are 1,900 male senior intercounty players in the country and the same number of intercounty camogie and ladies football players.  This is a total of almost 4,000 players.  Are we seriously saying that none of the 4,000 people who play top-level football and hurling in this country are gay?  We need leadership in our pillar sports.  I back David Gough's call for the flying of the Pride flag over P&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh.  I urge our leading sporting organisation, Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, and other pillar sporting organisations to consider this.

I did not hear too many shouting about it.  It has become an everyday occurrence in Israel for innocent men, women and children to be stabbed at random by Palestinians.  I do not hear anyone shouting about that.  Certainly the funeral scenes were appalling and shocking.  They are the worst I have seen apart from when the two British agents were trapped at a funeral in the North and were savaged and torn to bits before the provos killed them.<\/p> <p>I want to speak about something very positive and uplifting.  I was delighted to see that this year the organisers of the B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th annual ceremony have chosen to invite the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to do the oration jointly.  It is fantastic.  It is uplifting for someone from my background who was brought up in Civil War politics and all the rest of it.  It is a way forward and I hope people might learn from it.  It will be a great occasion and there will be a huge turnout for it.<\/p> <p>The Civil War fractured the unity of a wonderful band of people who had stood together against British tyranny from 1916 until the treaty.  Unfortunately, they split for reasons I will not go into here.  It is also important to remember that yesterday was the 96th anniversary of the founding of my party.  The first Fianna F&aacute;il meeting was held in the La Scala Theatre in Dublin.  We did not wait too long after the Civil War to condemn and move away from futile violence.  We turned our backs on violence and played our part to try to keep the gun out of Irish politics.  Some people did not learn as fast as we did and kept it going for another 60 years.  Thankfully with the Good Friday Agreement it is virtually over and I hope it stays that way.<\/p> <p>I welcome the decision by the Government to go ahead with the national maternity hospital.

As the Taoiseach has said, it is incredible to note that there has been no recorded famine in any democracy in the world.  That makes one realise the importance of having a democracy.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to another lovely event, which was the presentation of Roscommon passports.  It is a wonderful initiative by the Roscommon local authority.  Mr. Joe Murphy, who is the cathaoirleach of Roscommon County Council and brother of Senator Eugene Murphy, was in attendance to present leaving certificate students from across the county of Roscommon with a passport and tribute to say that they will always belong no matter what path they take after the leaving certificate, and that Roscommon is their home.

I put my name down as one of those people who would be entitled to go on the visit.<\/p> <p>It is great to see the former Leader back again.  It is like the old times.  Indeed, Senator Buttimer and I were in Shannon Airport yesterday.  As the only Dublin-based person on the trip, I ask those who live in the Shannon area and in the wider catchment area to consider using Shannon Airport.  We saw the fantastic facilities.  The airport has the most modern screening process in the world.  Passengers do not have to remove liquids, laptops and computers or do all of the other bits and pieces one must do ordinarily.  It is a fantastic facility.  I think we were told that the airport has capacity for up to 7 million passengers - the number is certainly between 4.5 million and 7 million - but the airport has fewer than 1.5 million passengers.  We are spending a lot of time upgrading facilities and building more facilities in Dublin Airport when we have Shannon Airport, which has one of the longest runways in Ireland.  Between Ireland and the United Kingdom, Shannon Airport has the second longest runway after Heathrow Airport.  Shannon Airport has loads of facilities.  The time it takes to get through security and everything else is just fantastic.  Parking charges are much cheaper.  I urge people to use the airport.  I do not mean to take away anything from Dublin Airport but I think we can spread the load better.<\/p> <p>Finally, I did not hear anyone else comment on the fact that this is Bike Week.

It is great to see a fellow Corkman there.<\/p> <p>If I may talk about something very serious, namely where we are going with our housing issues, we have a real issue when it comes to the Airbnb crisis.  Yesterday I was in Kinsale, where I met probably the biggest employer in the town.  I met 16 members of staff, all going through issues with rental properties.  Either they had got notice to quit or they had been told they would have to leave in the next few weeks or months.  There seems to be a campaign in certain locations, particularly scenic coastal locations, to clear out the rental properties and put them on Airbnb.  Today there are 150 properties in Kinsale on Airbnb and fewer than two on Daft.  It is unsustainable going forward that these coastal towns will be ripped apart because, unfortunately, we will not have the staff for the restaurants, the pubs, the nursing homes or the factories.  They will not be able to live locally because our rental property is now being advertised on Airbnb.  The knock-on impact on our tourism sector will be counterproductive because we will have hotels with low occupancy rates because visitors are all staying in Airbnb properties.<\/p> <p>I have raised this issue on numerous occasions and I am aware that regulations are coming forward in January 2023.  I do not think we can wait that long.  Those regulations need to be brought forward immediately.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage need to work in the next few days to bring forward something to this House.  Otherwise we will have a summer of Airbnb properties cropping up all over the place, using the rental market to fund that activity, and the knock-on effect on our society will be huge.  We should write to the Minister and look for him to come before this House to fast-forward these regulations.  Otherwise, towns and villages in scenic locations around Cork and the rest of Ireland will be devastated when it comes to rental property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#X00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Now, I hope, the penultimate word to Senator Ahearn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#X00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I acknowledge National Bike Week.

I am getting call after call from students who are struggling to get accommodation next year in Cork, in the Acting Leader's city, and in Limerick.  These are second year and third year students who are at their wits' end at this stage trying to secure some sort of accommodation for college.  A number of them now are looking at the possibility of travelling from Tipperary, from Clonmel and Cahir, for the foreseeable future until they get some sort of accommodation.  This is even before first-year students get their results in August and start looking for accommodation on the back of that.  It is imperative the Minister comes in here and outlines his vision for accommodating these students.  Most people are fortunate enough to experience student life, and part of that is living on a campus or in a city or area where the college is, taking in, obviously, the academic side of college but also the enjoyment of being independent for the first time in one's life.  That is an important experience to have as well as the academic side.  That cannot be experienced by living an hour and a half away at home in Tipperary.

I ask that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in particular ensure that funding is put in place for the project for 2023 and that it is actually brought through until planning permission is granted.  There is not a significant cost involved in doing so.  The significant cost comes when the capital works need to take place and land has to be purchased, etc.  I ask that the project, which is vital for the entire north-west and midland regions, be prioritised and the funding guaranteed for 2023.  We need to avoid a situation where the tap runs dry.  I make that point in the context of the funding that was put in place this year.  Funding needs to be put in place for 2023 and 2024 to bring the process through to identifying a route and getting planning permission.

First, I thank Senator Horkan for his honourable mention of the mid-west and his visit there yesterday with the transport committee.  I had a meeting yesterday with Limerick Chamber of Commerce.  The rate of unemployment in Limerick is better than it was prior to Covid.  The latest report published indicates that the rate is running at just over 4%.  It is very good news for the mid-west that there is so little unemployment in the area.  That is down to the collaboration between the council, the enterprise office, the office of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and IDA Ireland.  There has been a big drive in terms of the delivery of companies coming to the region.  A significant number of high-end jobs have come to Limerick and the mid-west in recent times.  Senator Horkan promoted Shannon Airport.  It is certainly great to have the airport, as well as Shannon Foynes Port, on our doorstep and that has helped in the creation of these jobs.  It is also down to having three third level institutes in the mid-west, which is really important.<\/p> <p>That leads me to my final point, which is that yesterday evening I attended a collaboration between Griffith College and the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  The college is running an apprenticeship degree programme for bar staff.  I met and listened to some of the apprentices who are participating on the course.  There are approximately 35 people in the first cohort, with more due to join the course in September.  It is very positive to see a programme such as that being run, but also the collaboration and sponsorship that is coming from industry.

It is important we learn from what was the worst pandemic across the world in modern history.<\/p><p>Senators Black, Sherlock, Dooley, Gavin, Murphy, Hoey and O'Sullivan all condemned the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.  All of us in the House stand united in solidarity in condemning the killing of that journalist.  As Senator Dooley said, as a person, she should never have been killed, but as a journalist, her killing, which was an attack on independent journalism, is also fundamentally wrong.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has made it quite clear there should be a probe into her killing and into the events of the funeral last weekend.  All of us condemn it.  What happened last weekend was wrong on every count, regardless of one's political viewpoint.  It is important we listen, engage and talk in order that the conflict and the dispute is stopped once and for all.<\/p><p>Senators Dooley, Craughwell and I visited Shannon Airport yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#Z00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>And me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#Z00300","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>And Senator Horkan, gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  We had a very positive meeting in Shannon Airport and with the Irish Aviation Authority.  This afternoon Senator Maria Byrne also made comments about Shannon.  It is clear there is a need for the Government to examine the legislation covering our aviation policy and for it also to examine the regional airport development programme with a view to ensuring Shannon and Cork are included in it in the future.  I look forward to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, coming to the House as matter of importance.  Our aviation policy needs to be updated and reviewed as a matter of fundamental importance given we are coming out of Covid and there are challenges in our aviation sector in terms of energy, the war in Ukraine and how we can attract people to come to visit our country.<\/p> <p>Senators Malcolm Byrne, Hoey and Cassells in their contributions all praised the coming out of Jake Daniels, the first professional soccer player in a generation in England to do so.  It is to be welcomed.  I congratulate him as an openly out gay man myself on his courage and bravery in a very masculine sport that does not embrace equality or diversity in the way it should.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Cassells made a fundamentally important point that in the world of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael of which the Senator is a member, as is Senator Carrigy, David Gough as an out referee has been a champion of diversity, as has D&oacute;nal &Oacute;g Cusack, to be fair to him.  We need more role models in the world of sport no matter what sport it is but particularly in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael given that it is our native sport and the one that is probably played in every parish in every urban and rural setting.<\/p><p>I join with Senator Cassells in calling on Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael to raise the rainbow flag over Croke Park in June.  Dublin Pride is the third or fourth Saturday of the month.  It would be a fitting step on the road to equality.  I am not telling the GAA what to do but in the same way that the Ceann Comhairle at the invitation of some of us allowed for and facilitated the rainbow flag to fly here in the Oireachtas, the people's house, Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael is our national sporting organisation so it would be an extraordinary act on its part to take up the suggestion of Senator Cassells.<\/p><p>I hope this House will join in supporting the Pride flag adorning Croke Park not as a political gesture but as a gesture of solidarity and equality with all of us in this country - a republic where we cherish all of our children equally.  I commend Senator Cassells for his contribution but, more importantly, as Senator Malcolm Byrne said, today is International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia.  In Cork we had International LGBT Awareness Week.  We need such weeks, as we do Pride, and I commend Senator Malcolm Byrne for his leadership and the way in which he has been a very strong champion of diversity and equality not just in this House but in his personal and public life and I thank him for coming in here today.<\/p><p>I also thank Senator Hoey for her courage because it is important that we stand up to any type of bullying and violence and not just today but every day we stand in solidarity with people and ensure we tackle discrimination.  Senator Malcolm Byrne is right.  The online space needs to be addressed as well but today is an important day.  It is important because all of us should congratulate Jake Daniels for what he has done and the role model he can and hopefully will become.  <\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne also raised the regulation of jet skis.  I agree with him on that.  It is critical that our beaches and coastal communities are kept safe and I thank the Senator for raising that issue.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss that matter.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I would be happy for the Minister for Defence to come to the House for a debate on the future of the barracks.  Senator O'Donovan spoke about the need for a debate on housing.  Like Senator Maria Byrne, Senator Gavan raised the issue of University Hospital Limerick.  As somebody who is not from the region but who was a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, I recognise that there has been investment by Government, including investment in staffing.  A specialist team has come down to the hospital.  We have had an extension to the hospital and infrastructure development.  There is something fundamentally wrong that needs to be eliminated.  The Minister for Health has not been shy in going to the hospital but it is important that the HSE and the Department sit down and take action if there needs to be accountability from the top to the bottom in the hospital itself.  As a layperson, I would say there is something fundamentally wrong in terms of the structure.  I may be wrong but both Senators Gavan and Maria Byrne have come in here repeatedly and raised the issue.  There is something fundamentally wrong in this regard.  I hope something will happen sooner rather than later.  <\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke very highly about the Creative Spark downtown hub in Dundalk and commended the two people involved in remote working hubs.  He is right.  There is a need for investment in urban infrastructure to create these hubs.  I will ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development and possibly the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss this issue.  <\/p><p>Senators Murphy, Horkan and Dolan raised the commemoration of the Famine and the new museum in Strokestown.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should all take up Senator Murphy's suggestion and invitation.  It is important that we acknowledge the tremendous investment in the Famine museum in Strokestown.  It is also important that we continue to remember the events of the Famine.  As Senator Dolan said, no democracy has ever had a famine.  We remember the people of Yemen today as well.<br\/><br\/>Senator Hoey raised the issue of SUSI grants.  I would be happy for the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come to the House with regard to this important matter.  The Senator raises a very pertinent point regarding people who received Covid payments being penalised.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Sullivan raised the issue of B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th and the foundation of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We congratulate the Fianna F&aacute;il Members on their birthday yesterday.  As regards the anniversary of Michael Collins this year, the decision of the B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th committee is a recognition of our maturity as a nation.  There is critical division but the fact that we are coming together in a decade of commemoration shows the maturity of the members of the B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th committee who invited the Taoiseach and also the leader of Fine Gael, an T&aacute;naiste, to the commemoration.  I look forward to being there to hear both men speak on the tremendous legacy that Michael Collins has left his country and on the need for all of us to reconcile, north, south, east and west, to build an Ireland in which we can all be free to be who we are.<br\/><br\/>Senator Dolan raised the issue of the Roscommon passport and the Rossies of whom Senator Murphy is one.  We should all remember that for two years, the leaving certificate class about which she spoke could not celebrate and the right of passage is beginning for it again.  We wish the class well.  We will have the Minister come to the House to discuss the Carrick-on-Shannon bypass and the need for infrastructure development.<br\/><br\/>Senator Horkan also raised the issue of bike week.  I know he was participating in an event outside Leinster House today.  He has been a strong proponent of cycling and an active cyclist.  The Senator raised safety for cyclists and I hope the Minister will come to the House to have a debate on this issue in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Senators Lombard and Carrigy raised the issue of Airbnb.  Senator Lombard has been a very strong advocate for reforming the Airbnb sector.  He left us with a very interesting statistic.  In the coastal seaside tourist town of Kinsale, there are 150 Airbnbs and two advertisements on <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  That paints a picture.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House on the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Ahearn also raised the issue of bike week.  He rightly referred to the extraordinary sportsmen, Se&aacute;n Kelly and Sam Bennett.  He also raised student accommodation, which is a huge issue that needs to be addressed at local level by local government and at national level by the Government.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Burke, come to the House.  The Senator is right that it is about the student experience.  It is unacceptable that students are having to travel from the University of Limerick to Tipperary or from Tipperary to University College Cork or Munster Technological University.  We should not tolerate or countenance this.  The struggle for accommodation is a real one and I thank the Senator for raising the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Carrigy also raised the important matter of the need for investment in the N4.  He is right.  It is about rural regeneration and investment in rural Ireland.  He is right to raise the issue and ask that the Government continue to fund the N4 project.  I am happy to request that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, come to the House.<br\/><br\/>Senator Maria Byrne raised the 4% unemployment rate in Limerick, which is an extraordinary figure.  She is right about collaboration.  I also commend the vintners and Griffith College on an extraordinary development yesterday when an apprenticeship and third level degree programme was announced for those in the bar trade and hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#Z00400","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>The Cork vintners were there as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#BB00200","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I know Michael O'Donovan was there because I heard him this morning on local radio.

It is something that has come up for us, as the Green Party, an awful lot.  However, I know for a fact that it comes up for every party.  I refer to election posters and the scourge that people feel they are.  <\/p> <p>When it comes time for an election, we all want to get our face out there and be recognised.  However, even when one looks at public polling, the majority of people are not in agreement that this is how they want democracy to go in this country.  The majority of countries in the EU take a different approach, which is what this Bill is based on.  It is based on ensuring that we have a democratic process that ensures that we have a level playing field and a full and free election.  This means that everybody gets to have an opportunity to have their face displayed, but it is done in such a way that everybody gets the same amount of space.  We have these on designated areas, which are selected by the local authority on the basis that it understands the constituency best.  <\/p> <p>The reason that I was keen to ensure that this was put into the Bill is because I spoke to councillors, and councils, particularly Galway City Council, who tried to put in place a ban on election posters.  There was then the idea of having designated areas, which is what this Bill does.  One thing that came up for people was the question of if they lived in one area and another councillor lives in different area, would the one designated zone be in the area where an opponent lives.  I have taken that on board in this Bill in saying it is the local authority that will have designated areas, knowing that it is covering the whole constituency.  That is very important.  The basis of that is a set of regulations issued by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That means that there can be a fair playing field for everyone.  <\/p> <p>We have found that the number one thing that comes back from people who complain about election posters is not just the environmental aspect, which I will touch on, but it is also the fact that, for example, they fall and hit people on the head.  I have actually had to go across the road and pick up election posters, because in the windy west of Ireland that is a regular occurrence.  There are also cable ties on the ground, which are a nuisance for people.  People with disabilities, mobility issues and those with young children who are driving buggies along the footpath all have to get around fallen election posters.  In 2019, Dublin City Council issued more than &euro;30,000 in fines for people who had incorrectly erected their posters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These fines were issued predominantly because of complaints from members of the public.  We, as elected representatives, really need to take on board what the public says it wants.  It does not want posters everywhere.  However, it is also fair enough to say we want to make sure there is visibility for candidates.  In other countries, there are designated areas at which the posters are visible and that give candidates an opportunity, instead of just showing their faces, to really lay out what is in their manifestos and the reasons people should vote for them.  That is another benefit of this proposal.<\/p><p>To move on to the issue of the environment, there were 600,000 posters in the 2014 local election campaign.  That is the equivalent of 23 Croke Parks full of posters.  Most of the posters are of really poor quality plastic because that is the cheapest.  The Green Party quite famously tried to produce more environmentally friendly posters but they disintegrated, as the Minister will remember.  It is more costly to do other things and environmentally friendly posters do not stand up to the weather in this country.  The 600,000 posters reportedly produced 360 tonnes of carbon dioxide.  The posters are a nuisance and create plastic that pollutes our oceans and the whole countryside.  In addition, they have an impact on our carbon emissions.  We are leaders in our communities and it is time for us to show leadership for the climate and environment however we can.  This Bill is one of the ways we can.<\/p><p>The Minister of State ran without election posters and got over the line.  Fair play to him.  What is really notable, however, is that he had had a long career before that.  It is quite difficult to run with no posters when everyone else is running with them.  That is why we must all make sure we are on the same road and why we have to proceed through legislation and regulation.  Individual councils have been trying to address this but have not been able to get over the line because they cannot make the decisions; they have to be made within the Department.  One approach is to consider changing this.  Another involves regulations that allow the local authorities to decide where poster zones would be.  That is what this Bill would do.<\/p><p>Another huge factor for me is that we are trying to have more diversity in politics.  It is incredibly expensive to get into politics.  In the last election I was up against people who literally had thousands of posters.  There was no way I could have afforded thousands of posters, nor was there any way that my party could have afforded to give me any money towards them.  An independent candidate does not get any support either.  One is really banking on getting a certain number of votes to get back some expenses, but the money does not really go anywhere near what it takes to make up for thousands of posters.<\/p><p>This legislation is a measure that ensures more equality and better representation in politics, which is what everybody says they want in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.  This is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to making decisions that will make politics more inclusive.  We have a low rate of representation by women in politics, and there is also a low rate of representation by those who do not have the social capital.  If one does not have social capital, one needs to make one's face known.  Those who are better known and have a longer history in their communities are the ones who get over the line.  When parties, particularly larger ones, are looking for people to run, they ask who is really well known in the community and who has a family that is really well known.  These are the factors that are taken into account, but they should not necessarily be.  We should be ensuring that people who are newer to our country are supported as well.  One step &mdash; it is only one &mdash; is to make sure that when it comes to visibility during an election campaign, everybody gets the same shot.  That is what this Bill will do.<\/p><p>I will go through some of the specific elements of the Bill for Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#DD00200","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652794200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
