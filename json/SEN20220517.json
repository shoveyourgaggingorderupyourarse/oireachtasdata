The Minister is very welcome to the House for this very important debate.  As the Cathaoirleach said, today, 17 May, marks the 48th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  As he said, I attended a wreath laying ceremony earlier today on Talbot Street, along with the Taoiseach, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alison Gilliland, and the cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Councillor Aidan Campbell, along with many others.  It was a very poignant event.<\/p> <p>Every year, we gather here to discuss this issue, but unfortunately little or no progress or forward movement is being seen for the victims, survivors and their families.  Some 33 people lost their lives in Monaghan and Dublin on 7 May 1974.  It was the greatest loss of life in one single day during the entire Troubles.  As the anniversary occurs today, our thoughts and prayers are very much with the victims and their families.<\/p> <p>It is very difficult and frustrating to try to understand how, 48 years on, the hunt and search for the truth and justice for the tragedy in which 33 people lost their lives, seven in County Monaghan and 26 in Dublin, as well as for the 300 people who were injured, is still going on.  We can only imagine the pain they have had to endure as a result.  That pain, unfortunately, is compounded today in many ways by the fact that, 48 years on, they are still waiting for the truth of what happened on that fateful day.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to all of the families who have worked tirelessly to try to lift the lid on what happened.  I also pay tribute to the Justice for the Forgotten group led by Margaret Urwin, which has campaigned vigorously to find out the truth, as well as Members in this House and the Lower House, including the Minister, who have also campaigned to find out the truth.<\/p> <p>For years, we have pointed the finger at the British Government for its agencies' refusal to hand over any documentation whatsoever.  There was some light or a bit of hope with families in recent times with Operation Denton and an investigation carried out by John Stalker, a former chief constable, regarding what happened.  It is heartening that the British entities we have pointed the finger at, and rightly so, for many years for refusing to hand over documentation, namely, MI5, the PSNI and the Ministry of Defence, have now handed it over.<\/p> <p>It is deeply worrying, and very sad and frustrating, for the families to learn that the obstacle or blockage now rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand it is a legal interpretation of the terms of reference which it signed off on 12 or 18 months ago.  Instead of referring to Operation Denton or the investigation by John Stalker, it is using the term \"inquiry\".  For that reason, it seeks clarity from the Attorney General on what it can and cannot hand over.  That is all very well, but meanwhile the families are still waiting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would appreciate it if the Minister has some news for us regarding what this blockage is and the imperative and urgency with which the Government will seek to alleviate this problem to enable information to be handed over.

I express my and this Government&rsquo;s condolences to the families whose loved ones were killed or injured in the terrible events of 17 May 1974.  Those callous acts will always be remembered as the single deadliest day of the Troubles, where 33 people lost their lives, as the Senator mentioned.  Many others were injured and had their lives changed forever.  It is, frankly, hard to believe on a day like this, when we think of everybody here in Dublin and in other parts of the country going about their daily lives, that so many ordinary people going about their lives on this day in 1974 were so callously and brutally attacked in the way they were.  There were many such incidents of violence on this island during the Troubles.  This was a tragic reality for those caught up in the bombings on 17 May 1974.<\/p> <p>I state clearly the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the victims and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We will persevere in our efforts to seek the truth behind these events and, hopefully, to secure some measure of comfort for the families.  Even though a long time has passed, it is important that we can secure that form of comfort for these family members.  The Government has worked consistently to implement the all-party Oireachtas motions calling on the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all the original documents in its possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We also continue to raise this case regularly with the Government of the UK.  We did this most recently in March at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, raised the Dublin and Monaghan bombings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, and with the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Conor Burns.  Again, the Minister emphasised the need for this matter to be progressed.<\/p> <p>Regarding Operation Denton, at the Senator mentioned, it falls under the general umbrella of the Operation Kenova series of ongoing independent investigations or reviews into the Northern Ireland legacy cases.  It is led by a former chief constable.  Operation Denton is an independent and analytical review into collusion involving the Glenanne gang.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings are included as one of the incidents in Operation Denton.  I must stress that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to co-operating to the greatest extent possible with the Operation Kenova endeavours.  A high-level agreement is already in place that supports co-operation and an exchange of information with the operation investigation team in the context of criminal investigations.  The historical investigation co-ordination unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to support this partnership.<\/p> <p>As the Senator also mentioned, Operation Denton is a distinct strand in the work of Operation Kenova, which is an analytical review rather than a criminal investigation.  It was as a result of this context that it was necessary to request legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General to progress clarification of how co-operation can take place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the lack of a statutory framework for information sharing, co-operation necessarily involves complex legal issues.  Following the receipt of advice from the Attorney General, work is already under way in my Department to establish the necessary mechanisms to allow relevant information to be shared with Operation Denton and it is anticipated that the mechanism should be in place by the summer.  As Minister, I will do everything I can to ensure that mechanism is in place by the summer and that all information that can and should be provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to this process is provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#C00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response.

As a Government, we have consistently raised these issues with our colleagues in the North and with our British Government counterparts.  We have continued to insist that there must be engagement and truth, and that we must find answers to all of the questions that these families have.

At the outset I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House and I acknowledge her ambition and that of her Department.  That is why I feel confident that we will get results from this discussion.  I also acknowledge her recent visit to my own constituency.<\/p> <p>I propose to address this issue, in the first instance, by moving from the more particular standpoint to the more general.  I met an informal group of parents in Cavan recently, all of whom were parents of children with disabilities and they made a number of points to me.  I will deal with those and will then deal with the broader objective evidence.  That is not to suggest that these initial points are not also objective but I will deal with the other issues then.  One&rsquo;s heart would be moved by meeting these parents as they are very good people who are concerned for their children and, in some instances, are very distraught.  I spent a good two hours with them.  It was a very moving experience and it would be a disgrace if I was not doing what I am doing now.<\/p> <p>Their first point was that for an initial appointment with Enable Ireland one could be waiting anywhere from six months to two years.  The younger children are seen more quickly in respect of an assessment of needs and are prioritised.  However, if one has an older child in the new progressing disability services for children and young people programme, one could be waiting for three years for any intervention if that child has received a private diagnosis.  The parents made the point, which I distinctly remember, that there was a particular problem if one has had a private diagnosis done, where one might not then get an assessment of needs.  That would be bizarre.<\/p> <p>There is no clear pathway apart from an assessment of needs in order to get the services.  One of the parents said to me that their non-speaking child is waiting nearly three years for a psychology assessment and that their other son is waiting four years in primary care for autism spectrum disorder and occupational therapist assessments.  The child should be seen within three months for initial paperwork and a complete diagnosis should take from six to nine months, if they have the necessary paperwork, for an assessment of needs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The parents referenced that a pay gap of &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 exists between those who work in Enable Ireland and the voluntary services, though I know they are section 39 organisations funded by the State, and those in the mainstream HSE, in primary care centres and so on.  The pay anomaly is huge.  We referenced it at a health committee meeting but I want to hear about it today.  Under the Haddington Road agreement, Enable Ireland staff are paid less than HSE staff.  A new deal was sorted for HSE staff but Enable Ireland did not receive the same, as per the manager in Enable Ireland.  Enable Ireland staff do not have the same maternity leave and pension contracts and it blames HSE funding for lack of recruitment.  It states there is a lack of recruitment and there should be international recruitment.  It blames the HSE for that.  The day the Minister of State was with us in Cavan, this and some of the other points came up.  The HSE takes months to approve advertisement of vacancies even when aware beforehand that a post needs to be filled.   There is huge bureaucracy that is ridiculous and should not be the case.<\/p><p>I move to some of the surveys and studies.  Inclusion Ireland did a report that scarily stated 85% of children wait for more than a year for appointments and assessments.  Some 1,000 families were surveyed for that.  Down Syndrome Ireland conducted a survey of their parents and 30% of them or 400 families, of whom 44% wait similar lengths of time.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, said 4,000 children are awaiting an assessment.  All of this makes for a horrendous story.  I am aware of the standard operating procedure that is obviously not implemented yet and of the UN convention.  It is something we could discuss for hours, but neither I nor the Minister of State has the time.  I look forward in her response to getting hope so that I can go back to the parents and tell them she told me this and it will make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#D00500","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this Commencement matter and keeping it on the agenda.  It was fantastic to meet him when I was in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  I commend the teams I met with, both the Enable Ireland team and our HSE team on the ground.  Both gave their time willingly to discuss the issues the Senator has eloquently raised and both said the same.<\/p> <p>One of the issues related to pay, the variation between teams and how difficult it is to recruit into those teams.  The Senator is correct that there is a gap between section 39 workers and section 38 and HSE workers.  It will have to be addressed because if it is not we will not be able to recruit to those teams.  We have teams that have not been fully populated.  That can be seen in Cavan and Monaghan, where there is a 25% vacancy rate.  Pay is part of the reason for that vacancy rate.  It is not the conditions because the conditions include that it is a lovely part of the world to live in.  There are reasons to choose to go there, including purchasing of properties and everything else, and the choice that is available.  At the same time, those people still have to go for a mortgage and are &euro;5,000 down in their pay grade.  They could be on a team with people from the HSE and section 38 organisations who make an extra &euro;5,000 and are sharing the same canteen room.  Of course it is a concern and that is not wasted on me.  I am trying my best to address that matter.  I am addressing it with the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers Supporting People with Intellectual Disability, FEDVOL, and recently had a meeting with Alison Harnett, who represents many section 39 workers.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned long waiting lists being experienced in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  What are we going to do about it?  We need to address international recruitment.  Where the Senator is located on the Border, international recruitment means looking to our neighbours in Northern Ireland and to the qualifications they have for speech and language therapy.  I keep talking about speech and language because it is done in Derry, yet we cannot recruit people qualified in speech and language therapy in Northern Ireland to southern Ireland because there is a component there that CORU does not recognise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an issue I am addressing.  The reason I am addressing it is that perhaps we can recruit and give training on the ground in the piece that is missing.  This could ensure the requirements of CORU are met and at the same time there is on-the-ground training.  This is an open and very live conversation with the HSE.  As I said, international recruitment, along with efforts to increase the HSE's reach into the broader domestic supply market for the non-regulated healthcare workforce, is being used as an approach.  However, there are limitations to international supply as Ireland is a signatory to the WHO global code of ethical recruitment of health workforce.<\/p><p>Technology to support the recruitment process should be used also.  We do not need to go on big trade missions.  We can do a lot on LinkedIn.  We can manage our time very well.  The Senator mentioned Enable Ireland.  The section 39 organisations are far more fruitful in their recruitment.  They have a quicker turnaround.  They can recruit more quickly.  Their process is more streamlined as opposed to taking eight months with the HSE.  It can be done in six to eight weeks in organisations such Enable Ireland.  We need to see why we cannot do it better in the HSE.  If the section 39 organisations are able to recruit so much faster, we should release the posts to them as opposed to having 555 vacant posts nationally as I stand here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#E00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

An agreed outcome of the meeting was that a plan would be developed in the coming six to eight weeks with a number of actions to support the roll-out of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.  I hope this will address some of the matters the Senator has raised.  It is important to note the Government has provided significant funding to the HSE for new posts in recent years to strengthen the capacity of the children's disability network teams throughout the country, including in Cavan and Monaghan.  Since 2019, almost 500 additional whole-time equivalent posts for children's disability services have been allocated.

I thank the Cathaoirleach and Seanad for facilitating this Commencement matter seeking a commencement date for construction of a commemorative site at the national monument on Moore Street.  As everyone knows, Moore Street is the most historic trading street in the city.  It is the birthplace of our Republic.  Despite being rich in history beyond anyone's dreams or what anyone could imagine, the street has been dominated by dereliction, neglect and antisocial behaviour for far too many years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I was first elected to Dublin City Council in 2004.  From even before that time I have worked with relatives, street traders and those who owned properties on the street to encourage the State, in the form of the city council, the Government and all the national bodies, to support the regeneration of the street and its market yet create an adequate and appropriate a commemorative centre at 14 to 17 Moore Street.  I have served on a number of committees and far too many to remember.  In fact, it is too depressing to think about that.  There have been far too many reports with the latest report being delivered to the Minister of State more than a year ago.  It was the third report from the third ministerial advisory committee on Moore Street.  So there has been plenty of talking and consideration given to this issue.  There is no doubt that there is enormous support for a proper commemoration of the historic events that took place on Moore Street.  The report made six recommendations but, more specifically, it made a recommendation on the national monument.  The report specifically endorsed the concept that was proposed by the Irish Heritage Trust that would require State bodies such as the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the National Monuments Service to be engaged to create an imaginative, fitting and appropriate commemorative museum.<\/p><p>Ireland has many examples of great commemorative sites of which we can be very proud but it is shameful the neglect that the State has allowed to take hold on Moore Street.  It is unacceptable.  Everybody appreciates that the majority of the properties in and around the historic site are privately owned.  However, it is impossible for us to be critical of the private owners and the neglect that they have  presided over when the State has failed to take adequate action.  The State must stop dithering, delaying and ignoring the dereliction and deterioration of an historic national monument that is located in the heart of our capital city.  The monument is not just for us in Dublin central or in Ireland; it is for all of the Irish people who descend from our Republic.  I ask the Minister of State to please give us a commencement date for works at the national monument and let us accelerate whatever works can be done because the dereliction that is taking place is shameful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#F00600","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her Commencement matter.

Having been allowed entry into the buildings, they were really quite stunning.  Even in its raw current state, and some enabling works have taken place, the project is impressive.  It is critically important that this important story of our history is told and I agree with the Senator wholeheartedly that we need to move the project forward and not just the national monument but the regeneration of that entire part of the city.  I am not from Dublin and I saw the street for the first time in quite a number of years.  I was shocked to see the deterioration that had taken place in that part of the city and it is incumbent on us all to move forward.<\/p> <p>In March 2021, &euro;121,285,388 was allocated to Dublin City Council in respect of the north inner city concept area 1 under call 2 of the urban regeneration and development fund.

Complementary projects include Moore Street public realm renewal works, with the intention of reactivating one of the most important trading streets in the city, along with structural and restoration works on the national monument at 14 to 17 Moore Street.  Works on the national monument, which is in State ownership, will facilitate the protection and reuse of these historic buildings as an iconic heritage and visitor attraction in the form of a 1916 commemorative centre alongside the rejuvenation of the historic street.  The regeneration of Moore Street market and the street is a matter for Dublin City Council, and I am assured that an expert advisory group was appointed in that regard.<\/p><p>The Moore Street advisory group, of which the Senator was a valued member, recommended in its report to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and me last year that the process embarked on by the OPW and the national monuments service of our Department to restore the national monument and open it up to the public as soon as possible should continue.  Officials from the Department and the OPW have been liaising to progress that.  I understand the OPW is in the process of appointing a team to carry out phase 1 essential works to the monument, which will ensure stability and provide a pathway for the phase 2 completion works at the monument.  I understand this is imminent and I hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks.  The Senator will, I am sure, appreciate that the Minister and I are keen that those essential works commence as soon as possible.<\/p><p>We will make an announcement in the coming weeks.

All of that is really welcome and reflects the Government's understanding of the need in the area.  I welcome that the OPW has indicated it will imminently commence works on the national monument at 14 to 17 Moore Street, but we need the OPW to keep to that commitment, to actually deliver and to demonstrate within the coming weeks that works will commence on the national monument.  The Minister of State is absolutely correct that if the State were to demonstrate its commitment to the street and a real regeneration of the national monument site in the form of a commemorative museum, it would be a vote of confidence not just in our history but also in the future of Moore Street.  It would be a vote of confidence in the street traders and all the businesses in the area and would demonstrate that this Government, unlike previous ones, will actually deliver in a respectful way for our history.

I cannot give a specific date but, certainly, that is our commitment and we are determined to see it through.  The report of the Moore Street advisory group, of which the Senator was a part, presented to us by Dr. Tom Collins, was a very good one and it was universally accepted as the way forward.

This Commencement matter relates to the burning of green waste and, in particular, the derogation he is aware the Minister signed in January or February.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This issue has exercised that committee but it has also exercised farmers across the country.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, traditionally many farmers clear out dykes and ditches and cut debris, branches, timber and so on and then amass or collect this greenery at certain locations, often in fields set in from the roadway network.  As such, they have had a practical issue with getting rid of the waste.  There is a practice, however, of leaving it there and then burning it rather than shredding it.  The Minister of State knows enough about the land to know that in certain circumstances it is not possible to get machinery in, particularly on damp or boggy land.  There has been a long tradition of burning well dried-out vegetation that has been cleared by farmers, and this is a concern.<\/p> <p>This year, it came as a surprise to farmers that the statutory instrument was out of date, but the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, signed a statutory instrument on 9 February 2022.  The purpose of those regulations was to extend until 1 January 2023 an exemption provided for under SI 286\/209 - Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal By Burning) Regulations 2009, which exists to allow farmers to dispose of waste generated from agricultural practices.  The concern is that some people, including farming organisations, thought this new statutory instrument would be in place for three years.  Indeed, I indicated in the wording of the Commencement matter I submitted to the Seanad Office that it would be in place for three years but that did not find its way to the final draft.  In short, there is a concern.  There is an appreciation, albeit with a bit of stress and misunderstanding in the context of communication, that the statutory instrument was signed but farm organisations and small farmers would like to see the derogation extended.<\/p> <p>I do not know what is the plan or feedback.  That is what I am trying to ascertain.  I understand that a review group was established by the Minister to consider the practice of burning green waste and explore alternatives.  Has that review group been established?  Has it met?  What are its timelines for issuing a report?  This is a critically important issue.  It is better to deal with it now than to be surprised.  Let us plan for it and find out who is on the review group, what are its terms of reference and whether there is any feedback in respect of what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#J00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal By Burning) Regulations 2009 make it an offence to dispose of waste by uncontrolled burning.  As an exemption, Article 5 of the regulations provides for the permissible disposal of agricultural waste by burning under certain conditions, including, among others, where the material to be burned consists of uncontaminated wood, trees, tree trimmings, leaves, brush and similar waste.  It should be noted that the exemption only applies to waste generated by agricultural practice and on the strict understanding that such burning is done as a final measure following the application of the waste hierarchy, under which the prevention of waste or its preparation for reuse, recycling or other recovery are preferred options to the disposal or landfilling of waste.  In addition, the relevant local authority must be informed in advance of the intention to burn agricultural green waste.<\/p> <p>An exemption under the legislation has been provided in recent years to allow farmers, as a last resort, to dispose by burning of waste generated by agricultural practices.  SI 51\/2022 - Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) (Amendment) Regulations 2022, published on 11 February, was the fifth such extension to the exemption and will run until 1 January 2023.

The feasibility study will include a literature review of alternative practices internationally carried out in regions comparable with Ireland that are viable, practical and environmentally sustainable.  The study will also include a public stakeholder consultation.  The study, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022, will identify potential alternative measures to burning and the potential benefits and challenges associated with them.  This study will help inform appropriate policy actions to take in order to establish alternative measures to burning on Irish farms.<\/p><p>The issue of air pollution caused by this practice is well established and is addressed in a draft clean air strategy, developed by my Department, which identifies and promotes the integrated actions across government required to reduce air pollution.  The draft clean air strategy, which it is intended will be published later this year, was open for public consultation until 3 May this year.  The final published clean air strategy will provide the high-level strategic policy framework necessary to identify and promote the integrated measures across government policy that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner ambient air while delivering on wider national objectives.  The key strategic priorities of the clean air strategy are as follows: to ensure continuous improvements in air quality across the country; to guarantee the integration of clean air considerations into policy development across government; to increase the evidence base that will help us to continue to evolve our understanding of the sources of pollution in order to address them more effectively; to enhance regulation and improve the effectiveness of our enforcement systems; and to promote and increase awareness of the importance of clean air.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#J00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>As I said, I am a member of the Oireachtas joint committee.

I acknowledge the decision by Cabinet today to proceed with the new national maternity hospital.  It has been a difficult couple of weeks in terms of there being strong views on both sides.  However, it is my strong belief it is the right decision to proceed without any further delay, given we have had nine years of delay already.  I hope developments over the past couple of weeks, given the Minister has been at the Committee on Health and we have had various medical professionals from the current National Maternity Hospital, from Dr. Rhona Mahony to Professor Mary Higgins to Ms Mary Brosnan, and many other clinicians and midwives come out to voice their support, have allayed at least some, if not all, of the concerns of many of those who were on the other side of this argument.  Ultimately, it is the intention of Government to provide a world-class healthcare facility for women and babies at the new site at Elm Park.  Even by getting the go-ahead today and proceeding to the next phase, it will still take us a number of years to deliver this project.  It is expected the hospital will open its doors in 2030. One can understand the urgency to try to get this matter progressed.<\/p> <p>The issue of Brexit remains high on the agenda.  We have seen confirmation from the British Government and Liz Truss that they intend to proceed to table legislation to take unilateral action on the protocol.  It is very disappointing, to put it mildly, that the UK Government would take such a move.  To disapply the protocol unilaterally, even some elements of it, is in breach of an international treaty, which I think we are all blue in the face from repeating time and again to the British Government.  I would welcome a debate in this House at the earliest opportunity with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss where we go from here, what the next steps are and to hear from the Minister what the European Commission intends to do in terms of its reaction to this.  I note the comments of the European Commissioner, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, saying the EU will take action, but we do not know what that actually looks like.  Ultimately, we need to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and we protect our citizens and businesses as best we can, although we have ultimately no control over what the UK Government does.  We are asking that it would act in good faith, but certainly the comments from Ms Truss appear to be to the contrary.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the fantastic work done by a local school in my town of Castlebar, namely, Breaffy National School.

Which systems and responses worked out and which ones did not?<\/p> <p>Last September, An Taoiseach said that he was wary of an official inquiry hamstringing responses to future emergencies, but is it not the opposite?  Would a robust, transparent inquiry not show up any failures or mistakes in our pandemic response and allow us to build on our experience and do better in the future?  It was stated in January there would be an evaluation of the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Can we get an update on it?

Alternatively, will the Covid inquiry be a real one that will drill down into and uncover the inconvenient truths, face up to the hard data and equip future generations with dearly paid-for information on how to handle an international pandemic?

It is unilaterally legislating to amend aspects of the agreed protocol, a protocol that it negotiated and signed up to and that its Parliament endorsed.  We were told that this was an oven-ready deal, that it was about getting Brexit done and that, in fact, Brexit was done.  However, it is now increasingly apparent, even to anyone who was not paying attention, that this is actually about giving cover to the DUP, which spurned every compromise and deal put before it, pushes even yet for the hardest and most disastrous form of Brexit and has refused to re-enter the Stormont institutions and adhere to the will of the people in the North, who just two weeks ago expressed very clearly what they want.  The people want parties around the Executive table and in the Assembly Chamber working for them to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, the problems in the health service and the issues that matter.<\/p> <p>It is encouraging that we have colleagues and friends here from the United States because we need to mobilise international attention on this in the first instance.  We have received a lot of solidarity and goodwill, as the Deputy Leader knows, but we are now in quite a serious predicament owing to what the British Government is seeking to do following its announcement today.  The announcement from Ms Liz Truss this afternoon on the protocol follows on from the announcement this morning that the British Government is to plough ahead with its introduction of an amnesty for British state forces, who are responsible for countless atrocities here in Ireland, North and South.  That should give us cause for deep concern, not least considering that, just a few months ago, this Seanad unanimously rejected the amnesty proposals.  It is important, therefore, that we have the opportunity to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the British Government's announcement today and the measures the Irish Government will take internationally to respond to it, given that it is a breach and a disregarding and walking away from the Stormont House Agreement, which we all signed up to and want to see implemented.  Although that agreement is an imperfect measure, it is one that we all agreed could be the beginning of a process to deal with the issues of legacy and victims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#P00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We learned last week about the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqla.

They protected the dignity of this remarkable woman and they had to endure the most horrendous abuse to do that.<\/p> <p>These actions are the result of a society poisoned by its own racism and militarism.  The Desmond Tutu trust, among others, has drawn attention to the clear parallels to the attacks on the funerals of activists during the apartheid era in South Africa.  The killing of Shireen is a tragedy and an absolute outrage.  It fits into a pattern of Israeli institutions and agents trying to silence and repress those who expose their cruelty to the world.

We all recognise the important role journalists play in protecting the fundamental freedoms of others and holding various different institutions to account.  To see the behaviour of the Israeli forces during the funeral was disgusting and appalling, and should be condemned in every parliament around the world.

It is important that the Government moves without delay to put in place a national aviation policy, something which has not been in place for a long time.  We have seen the growth of Dublin Airport.  I have no problem in principle with having a main airport where the capital city is because that is something that happens in every country.  However, it cannot be at a cost to other areas.  A relatively small number of additional passengers would take Shannon Airport to a critical mass whereby it could attract flights on a more regular basis to key destinations in Europe.  I ask the Acting Leader to have the Minister for Transport come before the House so that we can have a proper and open debate on the importance of regional development, and the growth and necessary input to airports such as Shannon to ensure they can thrive, grow and meet the needs of a balanced country and approach to the dispersal of our population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#R00100","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I am working from a list drawn up by the Cathaoirleach and have added one name.

There should be more flexibility in this area.  If this situation is allowed to continue, this young couple and their three children will go on the housing list, which will create further problems down the road.  Greater flexibility should be exercised, particularly by local authorities, in the context of young people trying to get on the property ladder.  What has happened to this young couple is a disgrace.  The husband has a trade, is working full-time and is earning reasonably good money.

The key ask is that we recognise and understand that we should not be treating Israel as a normal state.  We should recognise and state what the whole world knows to be true, namely, that Israel is an apartheid state.  We need to hear Government Ministers recognise and state that fact.  In all honesty, that is the only way to go from this point onwards.  We cannot keep pretending that somehow Israel is a normal state.  It is anything but and we have seen that with our own eyes in recent days.<\/p> <p>It will not surprise the Acting Leader to hear me raise University Hospital Limerick, UHL, again.  My colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, through a reply to a parliamentary question, discovered that last year 9,000 patients had to wait more than 12 hours for treatment at the hospital.  The exact figure was 8,720.  To give the House an idea of where this is going, in 2013 the figure was 4,000-odd, so it has doubled in less than ten years.  The really terrifying part of this is that a report by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Britain noted that, on average, there is one excess death for every 67 patients who stay in an emergency department for between eight and 12 hours.  Based on the figures from last year, we had 130 additional deaths of patients in our hospital in Limerick.  That is 130 families grieving over people who should not have died but did because of the ongoing chaos and impossible conditions that staff and patients alike are having to put up with.  This has been the case for a decade at this stage and it has got worse, year in, year out and month in, month out.  The promise of additional beds is not enough.  The figure of 92 new beds equates to just 48 new beds.  In reality, we have been waiting at least 18 months for those.  I just cannot understand the lack of action by successive Governments.  The latest news is that the Minister has declared that a specialist team will be deployed to UHL but we do not have any details of the team's remit and its make-up remains very vague.<\/p> <p>At the weekend, I stood with colleagues in Limerick city centre and people were queueing for well over an hour to sign a petition calling for a health emergency to be declared in Limerick.

In a nutshell, this means that between 40 and 50 remote working spaces in the centre of Dundalk town will be open to people to come and use.  I raise this issue because funding for the hub came from the Border enterprise development fund.  One of the stipulations is that the funding must be used to target vacant or derelict buildings in an urban centre.<\/p> <p>Retail is not what it was 20 or 30 years ago.  It has now moved online and there are so many different ways to do it.  We have to reimagine the main streets in our urban centres across the country.  We can do this by getting footfall back on to main streets through developments such as the one I visited today.  Every day, between 40 and 50 people will come to the main street in Dundalk where they will buy breakfast, lunch or meat on their way home.  This is about getting footfall back on the streets.  The way in which retail has moved to online purchase means that it may no longer be able to do this.  While funding is available through the Department of Rural and Community Development for villages and rural areas to turn these spaces into remote working hubs, there is still no clear line of funding to do this in our urban centres.  Dundalk, where I come from, was lucky because it is in a Border area but what about urban centres in the midlands, the west or further down the country?  This is an incredible way to transform our main streets, breathe life back into them and get people back on to them.  It is should be commended and looked at on a much wider scale.<\/p> <p>I pay particular tribute to Sarah Daly and Ciara Breen in Dundalk who have put so much effort into getting this hub over the line.

He is the first active male professional footballer in England to come out since Justin Fashanu did so 30 years ago.  Justin's tragic death has cast a long shadow over professional football.  Ireland is a country of sports lovers and football plays a huge role in that so it is beyond time for us to grab the thorny issue of homophobia in sport and call it out.  The players who represent us in our communities, counties and internationally should feel safe to come out.  I wish Jake the best for the future in his career and life.  I hope his coming out gives hope and comfort to those still living in fear of coming out as their true, authentic selves.  We must show leadership in the House that homophobia, biphobia and transphobia will not be tolerated.<\/p> <p>Students face the ongoing issue of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants being affected by pandemic unemployment payments.  I ask that the Leader to write to the Minister to get onto this issue.  Perhaps the Minister should come into the House to discuss it.  It is unacceptable that students directed to take pandemic unemployment payments for work they lost during Covid are now losing out on SUSI.  I warned this would happen at the time, yet not much was done.  The response from the Minister until now has been that students should just appeal to SUSI, which is not acceptable.  I do not think the Minister and his Department officials have any appreciation of how difficult it is for students to have the rug pulled out from under them like this.  It is not fair to penalise people for taking pandemic unemployment payments and then expect them to go through a complex appeals process.  I would like the Leader to write to the Minister on this as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#U00600","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It is great to see Senator Buttimer back in the Leader's chair.  It suits him.  He looks great.  There has been huge reaction in the Chamber today and throughout the sporting pages in respect of the fact that 17-year-old Jake Daniels has come out as the first professional gay football player since Justin Fashanu and only the second in the world.  As a 17-year-old he is to be commended.  He signed professional papers and made his debut in the past month.  It is a very brave thing to do.<\/p> <p>Where are we in our country in this debate?  I think of my fellow countyman, David Gough, the top GAA intercounty referee in Ireland and the first referee in Ireland to come out as openly gay.  In the past year he has done a significant amount of promotional work throughout Ireland.  He came out in 2015.  He said it has been disappointing that nobody has found the courage to come out since then.  He has gone on to referee all-Ireland finals and it has had no impact on his career.  He has expressed disappointment that the Pride flag has yet to be flown over Croke Park, the home of Gaelic games.  He said the GAA will ultimately regret not making this gesture sooner.<\/p> <p>There are 1,900 male senior intercounty players in the country and the same number of intercounty camogie and ladies football players.  This is a total of almost 4,000 players.  Are we seriously saying that none of the 4,000 people who play top-level football and hurling in this country are gay?  We need leadership in our pillar sports.  I back David Gough's call for the flying of the Pride flag over P&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh.  I urge our leading sporting organisation, Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, and other pillar sporting organisations to consider this.

I did not hear too many shouting about it.  It has become an everyday occurrence in Israel for innocent men, women and children to be stabbed at random by Palestinians.  I do not hear anyone shouting about that.  Certainly the funeral scenes were appalling and shocking.  They are the worst I have seen apart from when the two British agents were trapped at a funeral in the North and were savaged and torn to bits before the provos killed them.<\/p> <p>I want to speak about something very positive and uplifting.  I was delighted to see that this year the organisers of the B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th annual ceremony have chosen to invite the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to do the oration jointly.  It is fantastic.  It is uplifting for someone from my background who was brought up in Civil War politics and all the rest of it.  It is a way forward and I hope people might learn from it.  It will be a great occasion and there will be a huge turnout for it.<\/p> <p>The Civil War fractured the unity of a wonderful band of people who had stood together against British tyranny from 1916 until the treaty.  Unfortunately, they split for reasons I will not go into here.  It is also important to remember that yesterday was the 96th anniversary of the founding of my party.  The first Fianna F&aacute;il meeting was held in the La Scala Theatre in Dublin.  We did not wait too long after the Civil War to condemn and move away from futile violence.  We turned our backs on violence and played our part to try to keep the gun out of Irish politics.  Some people did not learn as fast as we did and kept it going for another 60 years.  Thankfully with the Good Friday Agreement it is virtually over and I hope it stays that way.<\/p> <p>I welcome the decision by the Government to go ahead with the national maternity hospital.

As the Taoiseach has said, it is incredible to note that there has been no recorded famine in any democracy in the world.  That makes one realise the importance of having a democracy.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to another lovely event, which was the presentation of Roscommon passports.  It is a wonderful initiative by the Roscommon local authority.  Mr. Joe Murphy, who is the cathaoirleach of Roscommon County Council and brother of Senator Eugene Murphy, was in attendance to present leaving certificate students from across the county of Roscommon with a passport and tribute to say that they will always belong no matter what path they take after the leaving certificate, and that Roscommon is their home.

I put my name down as one of those people who would be entitled to go on the visit.<\/p> <p>It is great to see the former Leader back again.  It is like the old times.  Indeed, Senator Buttimer and I were in Shannon Airport yesterday.  As the only Dublin-based person on the trip, I ask those who live in the Shannon area and in the wider catchment area to consider using Shannon Airport.  We saw the fantastic facilities.  The airport has the most modern screening process in the world.  Passengers do not have to remove liquids, laptops and computers or do all of the other bits and pieces one must do ordinarily.  It is a fantastic facility.  I think we were told that the airport has capacity for up to 7 million passengers - the number is certainly between 4.5 million and 7 million - but the airport has fewer than 1.5 million passengers.  We are spending a lot of time upgrading facilities and building more facilities in Dublin Airport when we have Shannon Airport, which has one of the longest runways in Ireland.  Between Ireland and the United Kingdom, Shannon Airport has the second longest runway after Heathrow Airport.  Shannon Airport has loads of facilities.  The time it takes to get through security and everything else is just fantastic.  Parking charges are much cheaper.  I urge people to use the airport.  I do not mean to take away anything from Dublin Airport but I think we can spread the load better.<\/p> <p>Finally, I did not hear anyone else comment on the fact that this is Bike Week.

It is great to see a fellow Corkman there.<\/p> <p>If I may talk about something very serious, namely where we are going with our housing issues, we have a real issue when it comes to the Airbnb crisis.  Yesterday I was in Kinsale, where I met probably the biggest employer in the town.  I met 16 members of staff, all going through issues with rental properties.  Either they had got notice to quit or they had been told they would have to leave in the next few weeks or months.  There seems to be a campaign in certain locations, particularly scenic coastal locations, to clear out the rental properties and put them on Airbnb.  Today there are 150 properties in Kinsale on Airbnb and fewer than two on Daft.  It is unsustainable going forward that these coastal towns will be ripped apart because, unfortunately, we will not have the staff for the restaurants, the pubs, the nursing homes or the factories.  They will not be able to live locally because our rental property is now being advertised on Airbnb.  The knock-on impact on our tourism sector will be counterproductive because we will have hotels with low occupancy rates because visitors are all staying in Airbnb properties.<\/p> <p>I have raised this issue on numerous occasions and I am aware that regulations are coming forward in January 2023.  I do not think we can wait that long.  Those regulations need to be brought forward immediately.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage need to work in the next few days to bring forward something to this House.  Otherwise we will have a summer of Airbnb properties cropping up all over the place, using the rental market to fund that activity, and the knock-on effect on our society will be huge.  We should write to the Minister and look for him to come before this House to fast-forward these regulations.  Otherwise, towns and villages in scenic locations around Cork and the rest of Ireland will be devastated when it comes to rental property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#X00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Now, I hope, the penultimate word to Senator Ahearn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#X00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I acknowledge National Bike Week.

I am getting call after call from students who are struggling to get accommodation next year in Cork, in the Acting Leader's city, and in Limerick.  These are second year and third year students who are at their wits' end at this stage trying to secure some sort of accommodation for college.  A number of them now are looking at the possibility of travelling from Tipperary, from Clonmel and Cahir, for the foreseeable future until they get some sort of accommodation.  This is even before first-year students get their results in August and start looking for accommodation on the back of that.  It is imperative the Minister comes in here and outlines his vision for accommodating these students.  Most people are fortunate enough to experience student life, and part of that is living on a campus or in a city or area where the college is, taking in, obviously, the academic side of college but also the enjoyment of being independent for the first time in one's life.  That is an important experience to have as well as the academic side.  That cannot be experienced by living an hour and a half away at home in Tipperary.

I ask that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in particular ensure that funding is put in place for the project for 2023 and that it is actually brought through until planning permission is granted.  There is not a significant cost involved in doing so.  The significant cost comes when the capital works need to take place and land has to be purchased, etc.  I ask that the project, which is vital for the entire north-west and midland regions, be prioritised and the funding guaranteed for 2023.  We need to avoid a situation where the tap runs dry.  I make that point in the context of the funding that was put in place this year.  Funding needs to be put in place for 2023 and 2024 to bring the process through to identifying a route and getting planning permission.

First, I thank Senator Horkan for his honourable mention of the mid-west and his visit there yesterday with the transport committee.  I had a meeting yesterday with Limerick Chamber of Commerce.  The rate of unemployment in Limerick is better than it was prior to Covid.  The latest report published indicates that the rate is running at just over 4%.  It is very good news for the mid-west that there is so little unemployment in the area.  That is down to the collaboration between the council, the enterprise office, the office of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and IDA Ireland.  There has been a big drive in terms of the delivery of companies coming to the region.  A significant number of high-end jobs have come to Limerick and the mid-west in recent times.  Senator Horkan promoted Shannon Airport.  It is certainly great to have the airport, as well as Shannon Foynes Port, on our doorstep and that has helped in the creation of these jobs.  It is also down to having three third level institutes in the mid-west, which is really important.<\/p> <p>That leads me to my final point, which is that yesterday evening I attended a collaboration between Griffith College and the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  The college is running an apprenticeship degree programme for bar staff.  I met and listened to some of the apprentices who are participating on the course.  There are approximately 35 people in the first cohort, with more due to join the course in September.  It is very positive to see a programme such as that being run, but also the collaboration and sponsorship that is coming from industry.

It is important we learn from what was the worst pandemic across the world in modern history.<\/p><p>Senators Black, Sherlock, Dooley, Gavin, Murphy, Hoey and O'Sullivan all condemned the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.  All of us in the House stand united in solidarity in condemning the killing of that journalist.  As Senator Dooley said, as a person, she should never have been killed, but as a journalist, her killing, which was an attack on independent journalism, is also fundamentally wrong.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has made it quite clear there should be a probe into her killing and into the events of the funeral last weekend.  All of us condemn it.  What happened last weekend was wrong on every count, regardless of one's political viewpoint.  It is important we listen, engage and talk in order that the conflict and the dispute is stopped once and for all.<\/p><p>Senators Dooley, Craughwell and I visited Shannon Airport yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#Z00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>And me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#Z00300","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>And Senator Horkan, gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  We had a very positive meeting in Shannon Airport and with the Irish Aviation Authority.  This afternoon Senator Maria Byrne also made comments about Shannon.  It is clear there is a need for the Government to examine the legislation covering our aviation policy and for it also to examine the regional airport development programme with a view to ensuring Shannon and Cork are included in it in the future.  I look forward to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, coming to the House as matter of importance.  Our aviation policy needs to be updated and reviewed as a matter of fundamental importance given we are coming out of Covid and there are challenges in our aviation sector in terms of energy, the war in Ukraine and how we can attract people to come to visit our country.<\/p> <p>Senators Malcolm Byrne, Hoey and Cassells in their contributions all praised the coming out of Jake Daniels, the first professional soccer player in a generation in England to do so.  It is to be welcomed.  I congratulate him as an openly out gay man myself on his courage and bravery in a very masculine sport that does not embrace equality or diversity in the way it should.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Cassells made a fundamentally important point that in the world of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael of which the Senator is a member, as is Senator Carrigy, David Gough as an out referee has been a champion of diversity, as has D&oacute;nal &Oacute;g Cusack, to be fair to him.  We need more role models in the world of sport no matter what sport it is but particularly in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael given that it is our native sport and the one that is probably played in every parish in every urban and rural setting.<\/p><p>I join with Senator Cassells in calling on Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael to raise the rainbow flag over Croke Park in June.  Dublin Pride is the third or fourth Saturday of the month.  It would be a fitting step on the road to equality.  I am not telling the GAA what to do but in the same way that the Ceann Comhairle at the invitation of some of us allowed for and facilitated the rainbow flag to fly here in the Oireachtas, the people's house, Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael is our national sporting organisation so it would be an extraordinary act on its part to take up the suggestion of Senator Cassells.<\/p><p>I hope this House will join in supporting the Pride flag adorning Croke Park not as a political gesture but as a gesture of solidarity and equality with all of us in this country - a republic where we cherish all of our children equally.  I commend Senator Cassells for his contribution but, more importantly, as Senator Malcolm Byrne said, today is International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia.  In Cork we had International LGBT Awareness Week.  We need such weeks, as we do Pride, and I commend Senator Malcolm Byrne for his leadership and the way in which he has been a very strong champion of diversity and equality not just in this House but in his personal and public life and I thank him for coming in here today.<\/p><p>I also thank Senator Hoey for her courage because it is important that we stand up to any type of bullying and violence and not just today but every day we stand in solidarity with people and ensure we tackle discrimination.  Senator Malcolm Byrne is right.  The online space needs to be addressed as well but today is an important day.  It is important because all of us should congratulate Jake Daniels for what he has done and the role model he can and hopefully will become.  <\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne also raised the regulation of jet skis.  I agree with him on that.  It is critical that our beaches and coastal communities are kept safe and I thank the Senator for raising that issue.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss that matter.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I would be happy for the Minister for Defence to come to the House for a debate on the future of the barracks.  Senator O'Donovan spoke about the need for a debate on housing.  Like Senator Maria Byrne, Senator Gavan raised the issue of University Hospital Limerick.  As somebody who is not from the region but who was a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, I recognise that there has been investment by Government, including investment in staffing.  A specialist team has come down to the hospital.  We have had an extension to the hospital and infrastructure development.  There is something fundamentally wrong that needs to be eliminated.  The Minister for Health has not been shy in going to the hospital but it is important that the HSE and the Department sit down and take action if there needs to be accountability from the top to the bottom in the hospital itself.  As a layperson, I would say there is something fundamentally wrong in terms of the structure.  I may be wrong but both Senators Gavan and Maria Byrne have come in here repeatedly and raised the issue.  There is something fundamentally wrong in this regard.  I hope something will happen sooner rather than later.  <\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke very highly about the Creative Spark downtown hub in Dundalk and commended the two people involved in remote working hubs.  He is right.  There is a need for investment in urban infrastructure to create these hubs.  I will ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development and possibly the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss this issue.  <\/p><p>Senators Murphy, Horkan and Dolan raised the commemoration of the Famine and the new museum in Strokestown.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should all take up Senator Murphy's suggestion and invitation.  It is important that we acknowledge the tremendous investment in the Famine museum in Strokestown.  It is also important that we continue to remember the events of the Famine.  As Senator Dolan said, no democracy has ever had a famine.  We remember the people of Yemen today as well.<br\/><br\/>Senator Hoey raised the issue of SUSI grants.  I would be happy for the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come to the House with regard to this important matter.  The Senator raises a very pertinent point regarding people who received Covid payments being penalised.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Sullivan raised the issue of B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th and the foundation of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We congratulate the Fianna F&aacute;il Members on their birthday yesterday.  As regards the anniversary of Michael Collins this year, the decision of the B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th committee is a recognition of our maturity as a nation.  There is critical division but the fact that we are coming together in a decade of commemoration shows the maturity of the members of the B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th committee who invited the Taoiseach and also the leader of Fine Gael, an T&aacute;naiste, to the commemoration.  I look forward to being there to hear both men speak on the tremendous legacy that Michael Collins has left his country and on the need for all of us to reconcile, north, south, east and west, to build an Ireland in which we can all be free to be who we are.<br\/><br\/>Senator Dolan raised the issue of the Roscommon passport and the Rossies of whom Senator Murphy is one.  We should all remember that for two years, the leaving certificate class about which she spoke could not celebrate and the right of passage is beginning for it again.  We wish the class well.  We will have the Minister come to the House to discuss the Carrick-on-Shannon bypass and the need for infrastructure development.<br\/><br\/>Senator Horkan also raised the issue of bike week.  I know he was participating in an event outside Leinster House today.  He has been a strong proponent of cycling and an active cyclist.  The Senator raised safety for cyclists and I hope the Minister will come to the House to have a debate on this issue in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Senators Lombard and Carrigy raised the issue of Airbnb.  Senator Lombard has been a very strong advocate for reforming the Airbnb sector.  He left us with a very interesting statistic.  In the coastal seaside tourist town of Kinsale, there are 150 Airbnbs and two advertisements on <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  That paints a picture.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House on the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Ahearn also raised the issue of bike week.  He rightly referred to the extraordinary sportsmen, Se&aacute;n Kelly and Sam Bennett.  He also raised student accommodation, which is a huge issue that needs to be addressed at local level by local government and at national level by the Government.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Burke, come to the House.  The Senator is right that it is about the student experience.  It is unacceptable that students are having to travel from the University of Limerick to Tipperary or from Tipperary to University College Cork or Munster Technological University.  We should not tolerate or countenance this.  The struggle for accommodation is a real one and I thank the Senator for raising the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Carrigy also raised the important matter of the need for investment in the N4.  He is right.  It is about rural regeneration and investment in rural Ireland.  He is right to raise the issue and ask that the Government continue to fund the N4 project.  I am happy to request that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, come to the House.<br\/><br\/>Senator Maria Byrne raised the 4% unemployment rate in Limerick, which is an extraordinary figure.  She is right about collaboration.  I also commend the vintners and Griffith College on an extraordinary development yesterday when an apprenticeship and third level degree programme was announced for those in the bar trade and hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#Z00400","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>The Cork vintners were there as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#BB00200","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I know Michael O'Donovan was there because I heard him this morning on local radio.

It is something that has come up for us, as the Green Party, an awful lot.  However, I know for a fact that it comes up for every party.  I refer to election posters and the scourge that people feel they are.  <\/p> <p>When it comes time for an election, we all want to get our face out there and be recognised.  However, even when one looks at public polling, the majority of people are not in agreement that this is how they want democracy to go in this country.  The majority of countries in the EU take a different approach, which is what this Bill is based on.  It is based on ensuring that we have a democratic process that ensures that we have a level playing field and a full and free election.  This means that everybody gets to have an opportunity to have their face displayed, but it is done in such a way that everybody gets the same amount of space.  We have these on designated areas, which are selected by the local authority on the basis that it understands the constituency best.  <\/p> <p>The reason that I was keen to ensure that this was put into the Bill is because I spoke to councillors, and councils, particularly Galway City Council, who tried to put in place a ban on election posters.  There was then the idea of having designated areas, which is what this Bill does.  One thing that came up for people was the question of if they lived in one area and another councillor lives in different area, would the one designated zone be in the area where an opponent lives.  I have taken that on board in this Bill in saying it is the local authority that will have designated areas, knowing that it is covering the whole constituency.  That is very important.  The basis of that is a set of regulations issued by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That means that there can be a fair playing field for everyone.  <\/p> <p>We have found that the number one thing that comes back from people who complain about election posters is not just the environmental aspect, which I will touch on, but it is also the fact that, for example, they fall and hit people on the head.  I have actually had to go across the road and pick up election posters, because in the windy west of Ireland that is a regular occurrence.  There are also cable ties on the ground, which are a nuisance for people.  People with disabilities, mobility issues and those with young children who are driving buggies along the footpath all have to get around fallen election posters.  In 2019, Dublin City Council issued more than &euro;30,000 in fines for people who had incorrectly erected their posters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These fines were issued predominantly because of complaints from members of the public.  We, as elected representatives, really need to take on board what the public says it wants.  It does not want posters everywhere.  However, it is also fair enough to say we want to make sure there is visibility for candidates.  In other countries, there are designated areas at which the posters are visible and that give candidates an opportunity, instead of just showing their faces, to really lay out what is in their manifestos and the reasons people should vote for them.  That is another benefit of this proposal.<\/p><p>To move on to the issue of the environment, there were 600,000 posters in the 2014 local election campaign.  That is the equivalent of 23 Croke Parks full of posters.  Most of the posters are of really poor quality plastic because that is the cheapest.  The Green Party quite famously tried to produce more environmentally friendly posters but they disintegrated, as the Minister will remember.  It is more costly to do other things and environmentally friendly posters do not stand up to the weather in this country.  The 600,000 posters reportedly produced 360 tonnes of carbon dioxide.  The posters are a nuisance and create plastic that pollutes our oceans and the whole countryside.  In addition, they have an impact on our carbon emissions.  We are leaders in our communities and it is time for us to show leadership for the climate and environment however we can.  This Bill is one of the ways we can.<\/p><p>The Minister of State ran without election posters and got over the line.  Fair play to him.  What is really notable, however, is that he had had a long career before that.  It is quite difficult to run with no posters when everyone else is running with them.  That is why we must all make sure we are on the same road and why we have to proceed through legislation and regulation.  Individual councils have been trying to address this but have not been able to get over the line because they cannot make the decisions; they have to be made within the Department.  One approach is to consider changing this.  Another involves regulations that allow the local authorities to decide where poster zones would be.  That is what this Bill would do.<\/p><p>Another huge factor for me is that we are trying to have more diversity in politics.  It is incredibly expensive to get into politics.  In the last election I was up against people who literally had thousands of posters.  There was no way I could have afforded thousands of posters, nor was there any way that my party could have afforded to give me any money towards them.  An independent candidate does not get any support either.  One is really banking on getting a certain number of votes to get back some expenses, but the money does not really go anywhere near what it takes to make up for thousands of posters.<\/p><p>This legislation is a measure that ensures more equality and better representation in politics, which is what everybody says they want in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.  This is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to making decisions that will make politics more inclusive.  We have a low rate of representation by women in politics, and there is also a low rate of representation by those who do not have the social capital.  If one does not have social capital, one needs to make one's face known.  Those who are better known and have a longer history in their communities are the ones who get over the line.  When parties, particularly larger ones, are looking for people to run, they ask who is really well known in the community and who has a family that is really well known.  These are the factors that are taken into account, but they should not necessarily be.  We should be ensuring that people who are newer to our country are supported as well.  One step &mdash; it is only one &mdash; is to make sure that when it comes to visibility during an election campaign, everybody gets the same shot.  That is what this Bill will do.<\/p><p>I will go through some of the specific elements of the Bill for Members.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It seeks to regulate the placement of election posters and materials for advertising referendums to a given number of designated areas, which will be chosen by the relevant local authority.  The Bill seeks to ensure that the advertising of election candidates and referendums is fairer, cleaner, safer and less wasteful.  It would prevent the current practice of attaching election materials to every lamppost, road bridge and electricity pole.  Instead, it establishes designated areas where election and referendum materials can be placed during campaigns.  This would enable the public to go and receive information on all candidates running in an election or information on both sides of a referendum.  It would reduce a lot of waste, street clutter and littering, which is often the accidental result of postering.  We do not intend to litter but I cannot tell Senators the number of times I have picked up other candidates' election materials from a bush and delivered them back to them because I was not going to let the litter remain in the environment.<\/p><p>This approach would also ensure that it is fairer for independent candidates and candidates from smaller parties by ensuring they can get the same amount of advertising as a candidate running for a larger and wealthier party.  These designated areas would be established through regulation by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The local authority would be given the task of establishing various designated areas across a constituency in line with the regulations.  These could include stipulations that advertisements are clearly visible and easily legible, that the appropriate number of designated areas exist across a local area, that the permissible locations for designated areas for advertising be established during an election or referendum campaign and that minimum and maximum dimensions be specified for the designated areas for the display of electoral posters and advertisements.  This approach is intended to ensure that fair coverage is given to each candidate or to each proposal that is the subject of a referendum.<\/p><p>I reiterate that this approach is taken in other European countries.  Therefore, we are not reinventing the wheel.  It involves exploring what works well in other areas and determining what will ensure we will not see people from those other countries coming to Ireland in the middle of an election campaign and wondering how we are so out of step.  We are out of step when what we are saying now is that we are leaders when it comes to action on climate with our Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, and when we are also leaders, as the Minister of State will know, when it comes to actions on national parks and wildlife.  Littering is another subject close to people's hearts.  I ask Senators to support this Bill.  Undoubtedly, some will have their own suggestions as to how to deal with this issue, but I hope others, even those from wealthier and larger parties, can at least agree it is time for us all to operate on a level playing field.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#DD00200","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  I welcome this Bill and commend the Members from the Green Party who have brought it forward.  The plastering of our towns and cities with blown-up images of incumbent and prospective politicians has long been the most immediately apparent hallmark of an election.  Even this tradition must be examined as we strive to be more conscious of the waste of materials and energy and to move beyond a throw-away society.<\/p> <p>A general election can see as many as 200,000 posters produced.  Laying these down head to toe would create a long line of plastic that could stretch across the island from Galway Bay to Dublin city centre.  In 2018, a survey commissioned by the \"Claire Byrne Live\" show and undertaken by Amarach Research showed that 77% of Irish people thought the use of posters during election campaigns should be scrapped.  Additionally, the aesthetics of the practice are questionable.  I do not care how attractive candidates are, I do not want to see them on every lamppost for a two-mile stretch on a main road.<\/p> <p>Recent years have seen more and more community associations and residents groups around the country pushing for poster-free zones in their areas.  It is not hard to see why.  Many people view these posters as something of a visual blight on our neighbourhoods, and I doubt there are many who feel strongly on the other side of the proposition.  Ireland is recognised internationally for the beauty of its towns.  We recognise this with laws to preserve architecture and open spaces.  Surely we can find a way to ensure such protection exists during election cycles as well.  Yet, these posters serve a vital role in ensuring candidates' visibility, particularly for new and upcoming political hopefuls.  If we were to ban posters altogether, it would make the already hard job of getting into politics almost impossible for many people.  It could be the case that voters might see a candidate's name for the first time on the ballot paper.  This is certainly something we would like to avoid in the interests of holding free and fair elections.<\/p> <p>It will be interesting to see what regulations the Minister opts for under this proposed legislation.  We must strike a balance between the visibility of candidates on one hand and sustainability and respect for local areas on the other.  It is particularly hard to run in elections as an independent candidate, whether those are local or national campaigns.  I refer to the cost of running for election.  I would welcome a ban on posters, but I am already established.  People know my face and my trademark glasses.  People know who Sharon Keogan is.  It is hard for other independent candidates, and it will also be similarly difficult for people coming into politics in future, to get known unless a candidate's face is known to the public.  Social media alone does not do that.  We cannot rely on social media only.  Designating an area in every town and village for advertising is possibly the way to move forward.  I look forward to seeing how the Minister of State acts in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#FF00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t- &ldquo;the Bill be read a second time on 30th June, 2023, to allow for further consideration of the Bill.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  I am delighted to see him here to discuss this important legislation.  This is an initiative I wholly support.  It goes to a subject close to my heart, as someone who has fought far more elections than is good for anybody&rsquo;s health.  I have also dealt with far too many posters over my lifetime.  I would love to see the banning of posters and I have advocated for this for a long time.  When I advocated this measure when I was a member of Dublin City Council, I was accused of trying to push down other candidates because I was from a big party and I was a big candidate.  I understand, however, the narrative behind that attitude.<\/p><p>I do not propose this amendment to be obstructive or to seek in any way to prevaricate on this issue.  This matter is part of a much wider issue when we talk about our democracy and consider our electoral process.  This is an issue on which the Minister and Minister of State have taken significant action and I commend them on that.  I refer to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 introduced earlier this year.  We are long overdue electoral reform.  We have a strong and old democracy and one we can be proud of.  It is not without its weaknesses, however, and there is room for improvement.  The Bill brought forward, on which I and my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage have done pre-legislative scrutiny, has great potential to strengthen our democracy through the establishment of a permanent statutory independent electoral commission.<\/p><p>That electoral commission will strengthen our democracy by bolstering our election process not only for local and presidential elections, but for all elections.  It is especially important that we deal with the issue of posters.  To a certain extent, posters are an obvious and public manifestation of some parties' clout and their deep pockets and armies of operatives that enable them to put up not just thousands, but tens of thousands of posters overnight and subsequently remove them.  Other candidates' posters can also be quite mysteriously removed, only for them to reappear after the deadline for taking down posters has passed, with the result that the poor candidate gets fined.<\/p><p>Getting back to the issue at hand, not only does the electoral commission proposed under the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 have the potential to deal with the not-so-nice elements of postering, but it also has the potential to deal with the electoral register and the registration of voters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Dealing with this issue is long overdue.  The register is far from fit for purpose.  It is far too easy to exploit and abuse it.  There are polling stations where people who have been dead and buried for many years vote.  I say with no disrespect to those who have gone before that they really should not have a say in modern-day elections.  Those who abuse people who are deceased by using their polling cards to vote fraudulently attack our democracy.  There is also the operation of the polling stations themselves with regard to checking voters' identity.  The almost overwhelming support for some candidates in some polling boxes is spectacularly uniform.  This is an important issue.<\/p><p>The funding of political parties is a very murky business.  Some political parties and elected representatives are incredibly transparent and raise funds through &euro;10 or &euro;20 tickets and table quizzes.  They are fully compliant with our standards in public office which is very important.  It is not a level playing field and we all know this.  The electoral commission has a job to do on this.<\/p><p>We speak about posters and how they can dominate but in some respects they are easier to police than social media, the use of technology and modern communications.  They are a lot more transparent.  People can see the thousands of posters that are up but social media is on our phones.  It is not just Meta, Facebook and Instagram, although they openly tell us they have no interest in the truth, have no role to play and abdicate all responsibility when it comes to asserting, enforcing or encouraging standards of honest communication on their platforms.  There are also all of the other communication apps, such as WhatsApp, and fake community groups and fake chat groups that are hijacked and infiltrated and used to promote insidious false narratives and discussions.<\/p><p>I commend Senator O'Reilly on this initiative.  I support it.  The reason I support a delay in the next reading of the Bill is because we cannot deal with this issue in isolation.  We must have an holistic approach to our electoral process.  We must look at all of its weaknesses and address all of them.  I ask the Minister of State to deal with this urgently.  The next local elections will be soon upon us.  Every candidate deserves an equal playing field.  All those who put themselves forward as candidates in an election deserve to know they are contesting the election on a level playing field.  They deserve to know the State operates elections in a way that protects, champions and delivers democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#FF00300","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The excitement of elections is something we should never forget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#GG00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I support amendment No. 1 tabled by Senator Fitzpatrick.  I have also been the victim of those mysterious reappearing posters that manifest throughout the country.  It is certainly not confined to Dublin.  I am sure it is reflected in practice throughout the entire country.<\/p> <p>I do not have a strong view on this one way or the other.  I see the merits and demerits of what is proposed.  Anyone involved in electoral politics will speak about the hassle of getting posters together and getting them put up and taken down and say it is something we could all do without.  Equally, on the other side, face recognition is very important particularly for new candidates.  We must also be mindful that while we all try to reuse posters sometimes during the electrical cycle we change.  I think back to my 2009 electoral posters when I was 21.  I do not think I would be recognisable.  Certainly I had more hair than I do now.  We have to be mindful and cognisant of the reality of the ageing process.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government committed to the establishment of a new electoral commission.  This is before the D&aacute;il at present.  It is the intention of the Government that the new electoral commission will carry out a body of work within 12 months of being established.  It will examine some of these issues, particularly election posters.  It will bring forward proposals prior to the local elections in 2024.  This is to be welcomed.  Having a permanent statutory electoral commission is something that has been broadly welcomed on all sides of the political divide.<\/p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick referenced the electoral register.  This is something about which I was quite vocal during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Electoral Reform Bill.  We still have work to do on this.  The proposal is that we write to people three times to see whether they no longer reside at a property.  This needs to be done within a statutory time period.  Unless we do so, we will continue to see an inflated register that this is not reflective of the people who reside in a locality.<\/p> <p>I welcome that we will introduce a connection with PPS numbers.  We need to move full square to this system within a short period of time.  Unless we do so, we will continue to have an inaccurate register.  All of us in politics acknowledge this is a particular problem.  An inaccurate register has a knock-on effect on percentage turnout rates.  They might seem particularly low but in reality they are probably much higher because people do not live in the locality, are deceased or are no longer in the country.  The work of reconciling PPS numbers with those residing in locations needs to be carried out within a statutory time period.  I do not see a need for a parallel system that does not contain PPS numbers.  We all get a PPS number when we are born or move to the State.  It is an accurate way to go.  I understand an impact assessment must be carried out on this and the Department is working on this.  For the future of our democracy, getting the electoral register correct is one of the most important things we can do as legislators.  This is why I feel the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which is before the D&aacute;il and will come before the Seanad, is of the utmost importance.<\/p> <p>It is important that the new electoral commission examines the issue before us with regard to posters and takes on board the suggestions made in good faith by Senator O'Reilly and her colleagues.  I do not have a strong view one way or another.  The difficulties and challenges are there for everybody involved in electoral politics.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is never any harm to question, challenge and change things.

I listened to Senator Pauline O'Reilly's opening contribution on my phone while on my way to the Chamber.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As ever, he is very welcome.<\/p> <p>I commend anyone who puts in the work and brings forward a Private Members' Bill.  I also sympathise with the Senators on the motion to delay.  I have experienced that on a number of occasions, particularly around electoral reform issues.  The voting at 16 Bill was delayed on two occasions in the last term.  On this occasion, I will make the case for posters and I hope it will be a robust case.<\/p> <p>We can all agree that posters, regardless of whether they are placed on designated structures, play a very important and vibrant part in our democracy.  As the Chair said, they create a sense of an election.  People like Theresa Reidy would agree that democratic participation is assisted by the presence of posters.  They ensure that the electorate is aware an election is on.  Senator O'Reilly talked about social capital.  In the absence of posters, a large number of people, perhaps those in marginalised groups who are not as engaged in current affairs programming, would be at a disadvantage in terms of the awareness of an election, and that would affect the turnout.  We know that when posters go up, the campaign is elevated and made real for so many people.  I am a supporter of election posters.  Sinn F&eacute;in is certainly a supporter of election posters.  I joined Sinn F&eacute;in at 16 years old when we had four Deputies.  We have been a small party and a big party.<\/p> <p>I also believe that restricting posters would give an advantage to incumbents.  New candidates struggle to get their names out there.  It takes time to build a social media presence and they may have to contend with an echo chamber.  If posters are restricted to a certain number of locations in each local electoral area or polling district, the campaigns with deeper pockets will be able to use private spaces, bus shelters, mobile billboards and car wraps, to gain an advantage.<\/p> <p>Renters would not be allowed to put billboards or posters in their garden.  Homeowners would be allowed to do so, but renters would need the agreement of their landlord.  I cannot get on board with the idea of equalising the space for all candidates because I think campaigns with more money may have an advantage if we restrict posters.<\/p> <p>Everything has a carbon footprint.  Carpenters will be used to build possibly thousands of designated structures.  If there are 166 local electoral areas in the country, depending on how many designated structures would be needed we could be looking at thousands of structures having to be built.  As I said, everything has a carbon footprint.  Canvassing probably has a very high carbon footprint in terms of driving cars.  The hierarchy of waste includes reduce, reuse, recycle.  In regard to reuse, I had 250 posters in my local election campaign of 2014.  They are still sitting in the attic.  Similar to what Senator Cummins said, I would say I am unrecognisable.  I had 250 posters but some candidates go way overboard.  Posters do not get candidates elected, as the Minister of State and others are aware.  I was very impressed that he did not have any election posters.  There is definitely merit in the argument to reduce the number of posters.  For a number of elections, we have reduced the size of posters to better match the size of the pole.  This means fewer cable ties are used and fewer posters blow away.<\/p> <p>In terms of reuse, many candidates wipe down their posters, dry them out and put them away.  In terms of recycling, perhaps the civic amenity should be open for a greater amount of time after an election or, indeed, all the time.  I have nothing good to say about cable ties.  I try to collect as many as possible when we are taking down posters.  I probably remove triple the number of cable ties relative to posters we have put up.<\/p> <p>I am thinking about winter elections, when people do not have a chance to answer the knock on the door.  Maybe 50% of doors will be answered if a candidate is doing well.  Many people have \"No junk mail\" signs.  Sometimes these things can be a sign of an anti-politics feeling, as much as environmentalism.<\/p> <p>I will finish on a point that dawned on me when Mary Upton was asked by the Ceann Comhairle to chair the family-friendly forum, which I was invited to sit on.  I welcomed her and told her that I remember coming home on a school run when I was five or six years of age and spotting Mary Upton in a car.  We realised who she was because of the posters we saw around the constituency.  That is the sense of an election for a five- or six-year-old that might be lost if we go too far in restricting posters.  Candidates will never advertise to people who are not on the electoral register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#HH00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Pauline O'Reilly for bringing the Bill before the House.  This is an issue about which politicians, in particular, become very excited and have large numbers of opinions, but I am not sure that everybody does.  I have an intense dislike and hatred of posters, but that is mainly due to the exertion that goes with them.  I had to chase after a poster of mine through two fields on Valentine's night in the middle of a freezing February.<\/p> <p>Everybody knows the feeling of losing an election and then taking down their posters and being dumped on by three-week-old rainwater when doing so.  We receive phone calls from people saying there are either too many or not enough posters, or that it took us a night to put them up and why do we not take them down.  I hate them and I would love to be in a situation where the physical exertion involved in putting up posters is no longer required.  However, we have to speak to the merits of the Bill and consider the impact it may have on democracy.  This is an important first step in raising this issue.  It comes up during every election, but it is rarely discussed between elections.  That is why this debate is good, and we can take a step back and think about what works and what can be facilitated.  I wish to add my personal opinions.  Like every political party, the Labour Party does not have an absolutely settled opinion on posters.  Different people have different views and opinions.  We should approach this debate in that way rather than digging ourselves into the trenches, one way or the other.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides for the Minister to make regulations in respect of this matter.  Perhaps the most relevant provision in the Bill allows the Minister to set out \"a method for the calculation of the maximum number of advertisements allowed in respect of each candidate, or proposal which is the subject of the referendum, on each designated structure.\"  I have some worries around that provision, as a first draft, because I am not sure it should be up to a Minister to be able to set them.  Could a Minister allow 600 posters for one political party that has three candidates, while allowing 200 posters for another political party?  There needs to be independence of oversight when it comes to doing that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State setting up an electoral commission, which exists in many other countries, is welcome.  For too long we have not had one designated electoral commission to look at things like ensuring the freeness and fairness of elections.  We are lucky to have a free, fair and robust democracy.  That is not guaranteed and an electoral commission, rather than a Government or Minister of the day, should be tasked with setting it.  <\/p><p>We need to ensure that democracy is fun and engaged.  Posters are fun and engage people in the democratic process.  I would not like us move to a state where we had a democratically sanitised streetscape so people would not know an election is going on, unless it is in designated spaces.  The way we do it at the moment in the middle of the night or, as some people do it, at 5 p.m. when the litter wardens go home, running around like lunatics - that is probably not a great choice of word - is probably not the best way.  We can make it more efficient and easier for people who do not have huge numbers of volunteers to do it.  Posters bring a frisson of recognition to the democratic and electoral process that is not seen if it is overly controlled.  Democracy has to be robust but also dirty, fun and messy.  That makes elections elections and engages people.  <\/p><p>We will not vote against this Bill.  There are many views in my party on this issue.  We need to make sure smaller parties and the robustness of democracy are protected.  It is a worthwhile, open and welcome debate to conduct in the middle of an election cycle when it is not pressing and nobody is throwing their opinions at us.  That enables us to consider how we do it in a way that is effective, environmentally friendly and easier on people like me who hate postering, while also engaging people in the democratic process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#HH00300","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The Acting Chair referred to the excitement of elections, and that was a very true statement.

I commend Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  We are having this discussion because she brought it before us.  It is important.<\/p> <p>As speakers from various sides spoke I thought of my election periods and all the times I was told I had better get a poster up because there was none of me in the area, that there were too many posters up and to get them down or that they were too close to the Tidy Towns region and should be taken down.  We are all aware of the many comments made on election posters.  We need to have the discussion but I am in favour of amendment tabled by Senators Fitzpatrick and Cummins giving a period of time to discuss this rather than rush it.<\/p> <p>Even the bigger parties, and I know my party colleagues will agree with me on this, now have to pay most of our election costs.  We do not get large amounts of money to buy posters.  It is very expensive.  Losing an election was a bitter pill for me and my family to swallow, which was followed up with a serious fine from Galway County Council, because it was the Roscommon-Galway constituency, for allegedly having posters up, when they had in fact been taken down.  I fought a hard battle with the council.  It was only doing its job but it cost me an awful lot of money at a time when I did not have it and had just lost an election.  That infuriated me.  In one case it was party workers who took down the posters and I took their word for it, but in the other case my brother and I removed the posters.  They went back up and we were fined by the local authority.  I thought we had to ensure some protection against this.  I would like to see this addressed in a Bill so people who definitely have not re-erected posters are not penalised.  How we would do it, I do not know, but it is unfair.  I am not the only one who has suffered in that regard.<\/p> <p>I think I can speak for the vast majority of those who fought local elections with me in Roscommon when I say I do not think any candidate in Roscommon would go into a Tidy Towns area for the past 15 or 20 years.  Most would not erect posters on bad or acute bends or put up too many posters.  Something I note in my county and have done myself is as follows.  I am not a fan of huge posters and think they should be limited but there is a type of board structure used by candidates.  One puts up less of them in the county or electoral area.  They are tidier and more acceptable.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan, when she was Acting Chairperson, mentioned the excitement of elections.  If we were to remove all postering, elections could be very dull.  There is a need for them not to go up in rural towns and Tidy Towns regions but I see a problem for the bigger urban areas as well.  Senator Moynihan referred to that.  Do we not allow people to put up any posters in major towns and cities?  I do not think that would be fair.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan mentioned the poll on the Claire Byrne show some time back.  There is no doubt about it.  The Irish public does not want towns and villages littered with posters and does not want them in Tidy Towns areas.  The vast majority do not want that.  We do not have to completely get rid of them, but to put a structure in place to control them.  Perhaps a designated area is the way to go.  How that would work, I do not know, but it is worth looking at.  If we do not rush into this and give a reasonable time for debate, many good views can come from various parties and everybody will get a fair crack of the whip.  I do not think anyone in Ireland would disagree with what has been brought forward today in terms of addressing the issue and curtailing posters in certain areas but not getting rid of them completely.  I would not like that to happen but it is a good debate to have and interesting to listen to comments from all sides of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank Senator Pauline O'Reilly and the Green Party Senators for using their Private Members' time to initiate this debate because it is important and people go very slowly.  Despite what people might say, there is huge resistance to controlling posters.  I am in favour of the substantial controlling of public posters.  The product used in making them is a concern, as is the amount of them used.  Larger political parties have an advantage over the smaller parties and Independent candidates.  The latter are courageous, strong, robust individuals who put themselves on the ballot paper, and there are plenty of them around the country.  They have difficulty in securing manpower to get the posters up and in paying for their design and manufacture.  There has to be another way.<\/p> <p>I lived in Greece in the early 1980s and there were designated boards.  If anyone knows anything about the Greek people, they are highly political.  In 1980 and 1981, there were television monitors on screens with political cartoons.  It was amazing.  People sat around pubs drinking ouzo, coffee and God knows what.  There was huge political engagement.  They are very political in everything they do and, in many ways, that is to be admired.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They had designated areas for posters outside the offices of the mayors on all of the squares.  The names of candidates were listed on boards, left to right alphabetically.<\/p><p>I am familiar with the position in the greater London area, particularly in Greenwich, where there are no posters.  Amazingly, there are very few posters in Britain.  The Electoral Commission provides every candidate who has been nominated and approved with an A4 sheet to use in whatever way he or she likes, provided it is legally compliant, does not incite hatred and meets all the usual standard checks.  Candidates can print a picture, message and whatever on the sheet, which is then delivered to every house in the locality.  That is a wonderful idea.  Rather than all of the trash people get through their doors, everybody gets one sheet that conveys a message.  It is not the case that the more posters a candidate puts up, the more votes he or she will get.  I know candidates who spent a lot of money on posters but did not get elected.  They did not even get half a quota so there is a lesson in that.<\/p><p>I always say that success in elections and political life is about breaking bread at people's tables.  That is a simple analogy but what I mean by that is that we have to look people in the eye, make our case and ask them to give us the gift of their vote.  While that is time-consuming, it is a very successful way of engaging.  I do not say this glibly but it is about meeting people.  The Irish electorate likes to meet people, be it at town-hall rallies or in community centres.  Traditionally, people would stand on the backs of lorries parked outside mass and roar their message.  Funnily, they did not go to Anglican churches.  I think there was an understanding that the Anglicans would not tolerate such behaviour for some reason, and it did not happen.<\/p><p>Mount Merrion is a little suburb in south County Dublin.  Elections are about community engagement and citizens.  The residents of Mount Merrion have issued a notice that they do not want election posters in their area and if they are put up, they will campaign against the candidate in question.  We see the same in Dalkey village and other areas.  Mount Merrion and Dalkey village are two places in my neck of the woods where this happens and it also happens in other areas.  Citizens, be they Tidy Towns committees or civic groups, can exercise power, take the initiative and collectively decide that they do not want posters.  We are talking about local government, engaging with people, having elected mayors and giving citizens powers.  Let us take back some of that and say, \"Hang on, I am in a Tidy Towns district and this is our district.\"   Let us network with residents associations and say we do not want posters.  That works and candidates must respect it.  I am sure Senator Ward is familiar with Mount Merrion and the approach taken up there, which works.<\/p><p>I welcome this debate and I am sympathetic to the proposal.  We should have some mechanism of postering but it should be limited because we have to help new candidates.  Name recognition is important in politics.  I remember speaking to a guy in the Irish Marketing Institute of Ireland about politics and success in politics and elections.  He said we should remember that politicians are a product like any other.  He picked up a green bottle of Heineken, spun it around and said, \"Heineken is in a green bottle and Coca-Cola is in a red can; that is branding, marketing and name recognition.\"  There is something in that and the psychology of it.  We can look at other ways of creating razzmatazz and encouraging people to engage, which is a feat the Green Party has mastered.  I remember Roger Garland getting elected.  A few days before the election, using two pieces of string he tied one poster to a bicycle placed outside the library in Stillorgan.  People laughed at him for doing so but a few days later he had a big smile on his face when he was elected to Dublin South, as it was then known.  Politics is as much about messaging, walking the walk and communicating one's message.  I agree, however, that new candidates need support.<\/p><p>The Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which has reached Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, provides scope to deal with a lot of this.  The programme for Government states that the electoral commission will be tasked with examining the use of election posters within 12 months of its establishment and that the Government will legislate for its recommendations in advance of the 2024 local elections.  There is a three-party coalition Government in place and its programme for Government belongs to the Minister of State and Government Senators.  I urge them to hold the partnership to account, although Opposition Members, including me, prefer to call it a coalition.  That is what the Government has signed up and committed to.  That is what the parties have committed to.  I wish the Minister of State every success.<\/p><p>Senator Barry Ward: @ 5.11 to 5.45 mins - Ar dt&uacute;s<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#JJ00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

Senator Boyhan popped it out at the end of his speech as if it was an unimportant detail.  I think it is a hugely important detail.  New candidates in politics who are running for office and putting their names on ballot papers need an opportunity to get their names out there.  It would be fundamentally unfair to remove the primary mechanism for doing that, which is postering during election time.  It has been said that we should have regulation and restrictions but we already so.  In fact, we have an increasing number of restrictions.  I agree with all of them, particularly concerning postering close to polling stations and also in respect of other aspects of postering.  Those restrictions are important and appropriate.  Removing posters or restricting them in a way that this Bill proposes is not appropriate.  I am afraid I have concluded that it is unfair to new entrants in elections.  That is the single biggest reason this Bill cannot and should not pass.<\/p> <p>I disagree with Senator Boyhan's suggestion that political parties and not the brave and courageous Independent candidates have an advantage and not.  Apparently party candidates are not brave and courageous and I am sure that is not what he meant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#KK00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I did not say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#KK00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Of course not, and I am not really suggesting the Senator did.  I do not believe political parties have an advantage.  Anybody can put up posters.  In fact, the people who get a real advantage from posters, the real name recognition, are the first-time candidates.<\/p> <p>There are lots of other reasons.  The international comparisons are perhaps not as reasonable as they might appear.  Let us take the example of other jurisdictions where there is a single place in a village or town square where people are allowed to place posters.  That system may work very well for them but other jurisdictions have different electoral systems.  Many of them have list systems, for example, so people vote for parties rather than individuals.  Until we change our system and make it otherwise, the individual will be the trump in our elections.  Individuals, even if they are part of a multi-candidate party ticket or courageous Independents, must be able to put their name out there and do their best to publicise themselves in a reasonable way.  Hamstringing them is unfair, in my respectful view.  It is important not to make comparisons with countries.  While this approach may well work for them, I do not believe it would work for us in the same way.<\/p> <p>Another factor is our geography.  We do not have the same focus on villages and towns.  Our population is much more widely spread than populations in much of the rest of Europe.  People tend to live in villages and town centres in Europe in a way that we do not.  Thank God the Irish countryside is relatively well populated with people who are dispersed throughout the countryside.  They would lose out in a circumstance where they had to go into the village centre to see the posters.  As such, I do not agree with that analysis either.<\/p> <p>Pageantry is important.  Although as a politician, a political nerd and somebody who follows this kind of thing, I might appreciate the pageantry that comes with politics.  That is not a good enough reason, however. What is a good enough reason is the actual publication of the fact of an election.  People get their information in different ways now.  In particular, young people often do not subscribe to the mainstream news that might come through RT&Eacute; at 6 p.m. on the television, 1 p.m. on the radio or whatever other time it might be.  Those people may not even know there is an election on if they are not plugged into the right channels or if they are not aware of the political process or whatever it might be.  As a politician, we would hope they would be aware of it and that we would be able to reach them but the way we reach them now is through postering, among other things.  Postering is a really effective way of announcing an election is taking place and the candidates in the area who people can vote for.  It creates a discussion around the postering and, therefore, around the election.  It is important to publicise an election and ensure that as many people as possible are included in the process and informed about it.  Of course, there are other ways to do that but postering is a key part of that.  To eliminate postering to the extent proposed in the Bill would do a disservice to those who have the opportunity to vote and participate in that election.<\/p> <p>I am sorry to keep picking on Senator Boyhan but he mentioned Mount Merrion and Dalkey, which are areas that are local to both of us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#KK00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>This is great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#KK00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am aware of the huge work that is done by the Dalkey Tidy Towns committee and Des Burke-Kennedy.  They have done amazing work making a fabulous place out of Dalkey, as if it was not a fabulous place already.

Citizens do not have to rule those people out.  They can actually still talk to them.  God knows, in Ireland more than in any other jurisdiction in the world, and certainly more than in any other jurisdiction in Europe, politicians are close to the people.  They are talking to the people and listening to them.  They knock on people's doors every day.  We complain about the clientelism of Irish politics but the reality is it brings the body politic much closer to people on the ground.  I have no doubt politicians are plugged into the citizenry, being citizens themselves in the vast majority of cases, and hear what they have to say.  In fact, what I would oppose is a Tidy Towns committee making a decision for all the citizens.  I have significant respect for Tidy Towns committees.  The Tidy Towns committee in which I am involved in my area, Monkstown, is a fantastic organisation with great people, but that does not mean they get to make decisions for other people.  That is an important part of it.<\/p><p>What is absolutely correct, however, is that more posters do not equal more votes.  Votes are not won by posters; they are won by hard work.  Working for people, knocking on their doors, listening to their concerns and then acting on those concerns is what wins votes.  When it comes to elections, however, everybody must have an equal chance to get their name out there and posters, like it or lump it, are a key part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#KK00600","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it chuig an Seanad.  I, too, commend Senators Pauline O'Reilly and Garvey on bringing forward this important debate about the future of our democracy.  I have sympathy with many of the points that have been made, including some of those excellently advanced by Senator Ward, because although everyone gets tired of seeing places festooned with posters, there are crucial questions that need to be asked in respect of the purpose of posters and whether they have an impact.  I agree that posters never got anyone elected.  If anything, as those of us who have been candidates will know, particularly in circumstances where a candidate has running mates, it tends to end up with rows about posters and who has put your poster in the wrong area.  If a Tidy Towns committee in a candidate's postering area decides to ban posters, his or her running mates will very helpfully inform the committee they will not put posters up in those areas anyway.  It has caused lots of rows.<\/p> <p>One of the interesting points in respect of election posters that has not been remarked on is that they have a rich social history.  I love looking at Alan Kinsella's Irish election literature website.  Some of the election posters from the early years of the State were a lot more graphic than those we see today.  They tell the story of the State.  There are still candidates who are very imaginative in the context of posters.  I think of Martin Mansergh, whose posters used to read \"Martin Mansergh - dedicated parliamentarian\", rather than the usual \"Vote for change\" slogan that almost always appears on the election posters of candidates.  Members will be familiar with John Pender, a long-standing councillor in Carlow who frequently recycled his posters.  Among his posters were ones with the slogan \"Johnny's got you covered\", which definitely got him attention through the years.<\/p> <p>I agree with the remarks of Senator Ward.  I have often encountered people who only become aware there is an election on when they see election posters on poles.  That is especially true in the case of referendums because, by their nature, referendums do not generate the same level of door-knocking as an election does.  Unless it is a prominent referendum, there is not the same level of attention.<\/p> <p>I have seen how the system operates on continental Europe.  The boards system works quite well.  Some of them are more than just posters; they are information for people.  As Senator Ward mentioned, however, those countries have different electoral systems.  Often, they do not have the same personality votes we have in Ireland.  If we are going to have a debate about using a different electoral system, that will certainly be interesting, but dare I suggest the electoral commission legislation is probably broad enough in terms of all the issues it has to cover, including that of Seanad reform, which I hope we will soon come back to in this Chamber, and the question of the enactment of the seven amendments the Minister of State has committed to addressing as part of that legislation.  Simply to apply here what operates in other countries is not necessarily the wisest move.<\/p> <p>If one is an experienced and known candidate who has been a councillor or public representative for a long time, one can almost survive without posters.  People will know your face and who you are.  It is very difficult for new candidates.  As Members are aware, it is common for public meetings to be organised for new candidates and for the name of the candidate to be clear on the poster, whereas the subject of the meeting may not be as clear.  It is an opportunity for candidates to gain recognition.<\/p> <p>There is a broader question in respect of fly-posting and postering more generally.  I appreciate the focus of the Bill is very much on electoral postering, but one of the issues that frustrates me is random fly-posting which, in many cases, damages the visual amenity of the area and is not as environmentally friendly as it could be.<\/p> <p>In considering this issue, we also need to take account of the cable ties used to attach posters to the poles.  Whatever about posters being taken down - as a general rule, most candidates are pretty good about ensuring their posters come down after an election - cable ties being left on the poles is a big problem.  There may need to be consideration of a system of registration or whatever.  In addition to the requirements for posters to be taken down seven days after an election, we need to consider a requirement for the pole ties to be taken down.<\/p> <p>This feeds into a broader political debate in respect of how we engage people in politics to a wider extent.  It is not just about politics at election time.  This is going to be about how young people are engaged in political issues and how we counter misinformation and disinformation.  As I outlined, historically, posters played an important role in informing people, but if we remove one element we also have to look at the broader question of how we keep people politically engaged.  I do not think it can be divorced from the broader argument.  That said, I broadly support the principle of what Senator O'Reilly is trying to achieve and I think it will be a healthy debate as part of the electoral commission legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#LL00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>My first experience of posters was in the 2004 local elections.  I was 14 years of age.  At that stage, my dad had been a councillor for 15 years.  I was helping him to put up posters at 7 a.m.  He fell off the ladder, broke a rib or two and, a week later, lost his seat to a former Member of this House, former Senator Mark Dearey from Dundalk.  That was my first experience with posters.  It was not a good one and it was not a good election for my family either, but since then I have come to love posters and see their value in the political system and campaigns.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Pauline O'Reilly on bringing this debate to the House.  There are very few issues on which she and I disagree, politically speaking, but this is one of them.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne stated, however, this is a very important debate to have.  It is what this House should be about.  The House is at its very best when we are debating issues of significance on which Members have opposing views but engage in respectful debate.  This is very much what this debate is.  As so many other speakers have spoken before me, it is difficult to contribute without reiterating some of the main points that have been made.  I wish to focus on a few of my key experiences of it.<\/p> <p>In 2014, when I first ran for election, I was 22 years of age.  I found the ability to put up posters and get my face out there in a wide geographical area of Dundalk-Carlingford, encompassing 40% of Dundalk town and the entire Cooley Peninsula, was very beneficial to me.  I found I was not recognised when I called to doors.  Why on earth would anyone know a 22-year-old running for election?   I had no track record and nobody knew me.  I was fresh out of college.  I found that the use of posters was a useful way for people to recognise me as John McGahon of Fine Gael, the young fella they saw on the poster.  It was a good way for me to introduce myself.  That was very useful as a young first-time candidate with no track record.<\/p> <p>Fast-forwarding to 2019, I thought it was a bit of a laugh that councillors throughout the country were putting forward motions to county councils to ban posters.  The councillors in question were all poll toppers.  I can name them.  In my county and in other areas, they were poll toppers who were going to get elected anyway.  Of course it suited them not to have posters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We can see it everywhere.  I am not suggesting this is the case with Senator Pauline O'Reilly's Bill, but two months from local elections, it is easy for any councillor to put down a motion to get rid of posters and get a bit of publicity.  It does not matter if the councillor is a poll-topper.  He or she will be returned to the council, regardless of whether the motion is passed.  That is why I think this debate today is important.  It is not opportunistic and just before an election.  It is being debated at a proper stage within this Parliament.  I think it is a good time to debate the issue.  A pet hate of mine is seeing the tags from posters.  Perhaps I notice them more when I am driving around because I am in politics.  I hate it.  When I am up a pole taking posters down, I try to take as many of them down as possible.  Another thing that I have learned about posters is that in a general election campaign everybody is very keen to help put them up, but when you lose, you are taking them down on your own.  It takes a substantially longer amount of time and perhaps some fines from local authorities to get it done.  Everyone is keen to put posters up, but when you lose, you end up taking them down yourself.  <\/p><p>Some might argue that we can advertise the modern way, by advertising on Facebook or using geo-targeting.  We have to look at the demographics as well.  The demographics of Facebook users have shifted significantly.  The average age of Facebook users is 40 or 50+.  Younger people are using TikTok.  The concept of being able to put posters up right across a geographical area allows everybody, regardless of age, to be able to see who the candidates are.  I agree with a point that was made previously.  It is easy for those of us who live in a political bubble to think that everyone is interested in politics and knows what is going on.  The vast majority of people do not care.  They only realise an election is happening once they see the posters going up.  That triggers them to realise that the election is happening and to look up their local candidates.  People become tuned in and turned on to an election when posters go up.<\/p><p>Posters are a fundamental part of our political discourse and campaigning.  I believe that they serve a purpose.  Another experience I had with posters was when I was at UCD, during student elections.  I was not very involved in student union elections.  Indeed, I was anti-student union.  It was a case of putting up posters on a poster run.  The Minister of State and Senator Ward will recall that it was almost as if there was a starting line.  There would be 100 people putting up posters and it was carnage.  It was organised chaos.  Students would run down the concourse in UCD to try to get the best poster spots.  All joking aside, I think that posters play a fundamental role in our political campaigns and discourse.  I believe that they provide an advantage to newcomer candidates.  Removing them gives an unfair advantage to incumbents who already have a substantially high name recognition.  I appreciate the debate we are having on this issue.  It is an important debate to have.  I think there could be a compromise somewhere along the line in the future.  Perhaps the compromise could be the introduction of a cap on the number of posters, or restrictions on the areas in which posters can be put up.  <\/p><p>Finally, Senator Ward raised a point to which I wish to respond.  It has not happened in my area, but I take issue with TidyTowns telling people where they can and cannot put up posters.  We are all happy to oblige, help out and follow the rules.  However, I would take issue with it if the practice was to become widespread, limiting people across a geographical constituency, when there is no law on the matter.  I welcome the debate.  It is very good.  Perhaps at some stage in the future a compromise will be reached.  However, I think posters have a role to play.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#LL00300","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGahon for his contribution and for the personal anecdotes.

It reminds me of the Bob Dylan song - Senators and congressmen, the times are changing.  I know that we have all put up posters.  We can say that it is all part of politics until the cows come home.  However, things have to change.  There are so many reasons this is a most important debate.  This Bill should be supported by the House.  First, the use of posters gives an unfair advantage to bigger parties.  I know that myself from running as a Green Party candidate.  Others do not have the money that the big parties have.  The smaller parties and independent candidates do not have as much of a chance of getting the posters up, which is unfair in the first place.  If we want fairness, we must look at that issue.

I wish to make a few points.  Senator Ward stated that posters do not get people elected.  If they do not, then nobody here should have a problem with us restricting them.  The second point is that we are not seeking to ban posters.  We are seeking to limit the use of posters to designated areas, which we have seen working all over Europe.  It is a bit like the way some schools in Ireland demand that girls wear skirts.  Outsiders look at us in Ireland and wonder if we are mad.  It is the same with the use of posters.  All it is is littering.  The posters are litter made from fossil fuels.  All plastic is made from fossil fuels.  We are using fossil fuels when we should be moving away from using them.  We should only be using alternatives in the future.  This plastic is used all over the place.  I know there are regulations, but they are not adhered to.  Senators should not think for a second that because there are regulations, they are adhered to.  I grew up with Fianna F&aacute;il always having the best poster spots, so I was determined that if I ever ran for election, I would get my posters up first, with plotted placement and all that.  We had it all measured.  We put the posters up at the lowest possible height.  We were OCD about it.  We had the ladders up and put the posters up in exactly the right place.  Lo and behold, people who did not get up at the crack of dawn put their posters up over mine, and not one was removed.  Let us not kid ourselves into thinking that we have any control over the putting up of posters.  Posters are littering our country every four or five years.  Their use is backward.  People use social media now.  It is a joke to think that just because the over 50s are on Facebook we cannot reach the masses.  Young people have no interest in posters.  I was actually embarrassed putting up posters the last time.  Posters only feature the candidate's face.  They tell people nothing about the candidate or what he or she stands for.  The posters just display the name of the candidate's party.  No woman or member of the Green Party has ever been elected in north County Clare.  My point is that everything has changed.  If we do not make the change now, when are we going to do it?  Will we wait until we have run out of fossil fuels to make the plastic posters?<\/p> <p>The use of posters is also unfair on new candidates.  They do not have the money that people who are already elected have.  First of all, those who are elected have a political wage, and in some cases, they have parties helping them with the cost of posters.  If we allow posters to go up everywhere, first-time candidates are placed at a disadvantage.

It does not make a difference if the Senator explains, because if you explain, you are losing.  Social media and the media are running the show.  If we save the money we spend on posters, we might have some hope of using it on social media to get the truth of what we are actually trying to say and do, as a Government, across.  I feel very strongly about it.  The use of posters is a joke.  It is so 1980s.  It really is.  If we need to use posters to get elected in this day and age, there is something wrong with our system.  I know some will say we can be for or against the use of posters.  I think this is a really important Bill.  It is good to have a debate, but we also need support for the Bill.  Of course, some will always object to a Bill if it is a Government Bill or a Green Party Bill.  That is their prerogative.  We can look at other countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Italy and Spain.  Foreign friends of mine think the use of posters is mad.  We are a laughing stock when it comes to elections and the use of posters.  The cable ties are a joke.  The photo of candidates looking weird on posters is a joke.  Candidates do not look like themselves at all.  It is very strange.

We want to represent the people. I believe that if we asked the people of Ireland tomorrow morning, the vast majority of them would say that they do not want posters.  If our job is to represent the people, and the people do not want posters, we should take this Bill seriously and get it over the line.  I welcome the support of my colleagues in the Green Party, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and my colleagues in government and opposition.  I urge them to take this Bill seriously.  I have tried using recycled and biodegradable posters.  They do not work.  It is a joke.  Plastic is evil and we have to move away from using it.  We know that it is ruining our oceans and rivers.  Now, it is in our stomachs.  We must take it seriously.  It is a serious issue.  Posters are bad, and we need to move away from using them.  Politics is a different game now.  We all know it.  We have the media and social media.  Let us not pretend that we need posters anymore.

Usually we have these discussions when an electoral event comes up.  It is very important to have a discussion now.<br\/><br\/>At the outset, I will give feedback on some of the contributions that Senators have made.  Senator O'Reilly correctly stated that I successfully ran an election campaign in 2020 without election posters, but I would not recommend it.  They did not know who I was in some parts of County Carlow.  The other point is that there were election posters up all over the place and still people did not know there was an election on.  In many ways, it was probably foolhardy to make that decision.  My campaign team was a little bit taken aback when I announced it on local radio but I am here and testament to the fact that election campaigns can be successfully ran without posters.  Having said that, I was first elected in 2004 and I was therefore well known in the local community, having successfully contested local elections, and also contested by-elections and general elections.  There is a distinct disadvantage for new candidates.  It is important that Senator O'Reilly's Bill recognises this.<br\/><br\/>A number of us met representatives of the men's shed movement a number of weeks ago in Buswells Hotel.  They were talking about creative uses of election posters.  We have seen such uses.  Apparently, they are very good for servicing tractors and excellent for henhouses.  There are many other very good uses for the repurposing of election posters that we have seen down the years.  One Member mentioned that during one electoral event there were 600,000 posters.  Senator Garvey mentioned electoral cycles being every four to five years.  They are not.  They are perhaps every two to three years.  With referendums, perhaps a directly elected mayor for Limerick and other electoral events, one could be talking about millions of posters over four or five electoral events.  That is really what we are talking about in scale.  We are mindful of that significance.<br\/><br\/>Some very useful points were made by Senators.  Senator Keogan referenced the issue of moving beyond a throwaway society.  We have to give consideration to this.  It is very important.<br\/><br\/>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the role of the electoral commission.  I will address that in my closing comments.<br\/><br\/>I recognise, as Senators Cummins, Moynihan and others have referenced, that posters are part of the paraphernalia of our electoral system.  They are part of the panache, fun and messiness of it.  I think that is what Senator Moynihan raised.  It is exciting to be involved when the election is announced and we get our posters up on our first day.  That is quite important.  I also recognise that while there are restrictions on postering in other countries such as Greece, as Senator Boyhan has raised, there are also very different electoral systems.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious of the contributions of Members.  It is a very useful debate but, critically, it will provide a further opportunity for Members to input into the electoral commission as well.  The commission is best placed for this.  The next electoral event might possibly be for the directly elected mayor of Limerick.  It is something of which we need to be mindful.<br\/><br\/>Senator Byrne referenced the issue of fly-posting and random postering.  Although these activities are illegal under the Litter Pollution Act 1997, people continue to engage in them.  There was a suggestion at one election of using colour-coded cable ties - green for the Green Party, red for the Labour Party, etc. - to give us an idea who owns the cable ties.<br\/><br\/>It has been a very useful debate.  I thank all the Members for their contributions and Senator O'Reilly for bringing the Bill forward.  The requirements for election posters are set out in section 19 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997, the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009 and the Electoral Act 1992.  Posters may only be erected for a certain specified time period before an election.  This time period either begins 30 days before the poll date, or on the date the polling day order for the election is made, whichever provides the shorter period of time.  Posters must be removed within seven days of polling day.  The position on referendums is that posters can be displayed from the date on which the Minister makes the polling day order to appoint the day on which the referendum is being held.  Again, referendum posters must be removed within seven days of polling day.<br\/><br\/>The running of election and referendum communications campaigns has evolved in recent years, with social media increasingly being used to share information on elections and referendums.  That has been referenced by a number of Members.  While posters continue to remain a central part of communications during election campaigns and referendums, it is important that their utility is examined as we go forward, especially in terms of their impact on the environment and the visual amenity of local areas, in terms of expenditure and, ultimately, in terms of their effectiveness in communicating with the electorate and the public.<br\/><br\/>Of course, any examination of the issue of election posters must ensure due regard is had to the principle of equality of treatment in electoral practices and respect for voters and candidates.  It is for reasons such as this that the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, includes a commitment to examine the use of posters at elections and referendums and to consult on placing limitations on the number of posters utilised.  This examination is to be undertaken by the electoral commission which is currently being legislated for by way of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022.<br\/><br\/>The Electoral Reform Bill 2022 was published in March and is currently progressing through the Oireachtas with Committee Stage due to commence in the D&aacute;il shortly.  The Bill will implement the ambitious electoral reform agenda set out in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future.  The extensive package of reforms set out in the Bill will address some of the most significant challenges which our electoral system faces today and will create much-needed capacity within our system to anticipate and address new challenges into the future.  The Bill contains detailed provisions in respect of four distinct areas.<br\/><br\/>In the first area, it establishes an electoral commission for Ireland.  This independent specialised body will be positioned at the centre of our electoral system to bring a range of existing functions under one roof.  It will take responsibility for several new functions which will address emerging opportunities and challenges as our society and electoral environment evolve.<br\/><br\/>In the second area, the Bill provides the legislative basis for the modernisation of our electoral registration process, which has been referenced by Members this afternoon.  It will make registering to vote more accessible and more streamlined by enabling online registration, simplified forms and a continuously updated or rolling register in order that people can update their details at any time.<br\/><br\/>In the third area, the Bill provides for regulation of online political advertising.  The spread of online disinformation in the run-up to electoral events is one of the most serious threats to our electoral system.  In response to this threat, the Bill provides for greater transparency in respect of online political advertising during election periods.  It will ensure transparency in political advertising and help to protect our electoral processes from hidden interference.  These provisions entail bringing the online electoral advertising space into line with our existing regulations around more traditional forms of advertising.<br\/><br\/>In the fourth area, the Bill includes measures to assist returning officers in running electoral events should public health restrictions be in place due to pandemics such as we have experienced with Covid-19.  The Electoral Reform Bill 2022 represents a significant reform of our electoral legislation progress and structures and makes our system more accessible and inclusive.<br\/><br\/>In addition to these reforms, the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, contains a number of further commitments relating to electoral reform.  It is envisaged that these commitments will be advanced with appropriate input from the electoral commission when established.  One such commitment, which is of relevance to this debate, is the commitment relating to election posters.  The programme for Government provides that the electoral commission will be tasked with:<\/p><blockquote>\t[examining] the issue of the use of posters at elections and referendums within 12 months of its establishment, and consult on placing limitations on the number of posters that can be used or fixing certain locations for their use.  The Government will legislate for its recommendations in advance of the 2024 Local Elections. <\/blockquote><p>It is envisaged that upon its establishment, the electoral commission will undertake an examination of the use of posters at elections and referendums.  The Private Members' Bill before us today can be considered along with any recommendations that the commission may make.  This approach will allow for a comprehensive consideration of the matter.  It will allow the electoral commission to undertake research and consultation as necessary which will robustly inform the development of any legislative changes in this area.  In light of this commitment, it would be premature to legislate without allowing the electoral commission to carry out this examination.  It would be prudent to allow the electoral commission to undertake this work in advance.<br\/><br\/>There is another issue of a more technical nature in this Bill to which I wish to draw the Members' attention.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill propose to amend the Electoral (Polling Schemes) Regulations 2021 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Essentially, these provisions are using primary legislation to amend secondary legislation.  This approach would require further detailed consideration in the course of the drafting.  As a result of the foregoing, especially the extensive electoral reform programme I am currently advancing, we should wait until the electoral commission has made recommendations on the issue.  This work by the commission will add considerable value to any proposals on this matter and will facilitate appropriate research and consultation among relevant parties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In summary, I thank Senator Pauline O'Reilly for bringing the Bill forward.  Members will agree that there has been a very useful debate and a broader debate which we have to consider, not just around postering, but its wider context on our political system.  This is around the use of precious resources for political parties and candidates on broader issues in informing the electorate and in looking at the transformational changes that are taking place in communications and media over recent years.  In that sense, it has been very useful to discuss this Bill and in listening to the contributions of the Members we have had both support and opposition to the Bill.  Some would prefer to continue the business as usual of using posters with limited regulation or intervention.  It is important in our electoral system.  This was alluded to by Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly in her opening comments, where we really want to use the commission to attract new people into politics.  We want that research and advocacy function to encourage people to get involved in our electoral and political system so that our council, D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers are more reflective of the people that are living here also.  That is a very important part of it.<\/p><p>Cost is sometimes a prohibitive factor and it is something that we are all cognisant of when we are filling out our Standards In Public Office Commission forms at the end of an election because the posters, for me, were by far the biggest outlay that I had in previous elections.  When I look back at my posters from 2004 and how I look now, one can see what politics does to a candidate.  That particular part of it gives us a very exciting opportunity, with the commission, to greatly transform our political and democratic system in Ireland.  I, for one, am very excited by that prospect and what it could mean for the electoral system.  <\/p><p>I welcome the discussion, contributions and proposals from Members.  Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Bill will be given consideration as the commission moves to give a broader appraisal of the limitation of election posters.  I thank the Senator again for bringing this legislation forward.  It is a great privilege to be able to speak on it, and I thank all Members for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#MM01000","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his words and my thanks to everybody who has engaged in this debate.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Minister of State will encourage the commission to look at this Bill as part of its work because significant work has been put into it.  I have heard many of the arguments that have been made here.  My one comment is that when it comes to the place of posters in the democratic process, perhaps that is part of the problem.  What type of democracy do we want?  Do we want democracy which is based on people&rsquo;s faces, with nothing else behind which person is most popular, who has the most money, who gets their face out there the most, and is the one who is elected?  That is what we have.  <\/p> <p>Does this affect the quality of our democracy?  It does affect the quality of our democracy.  That is why it is key to look at designated areas where people are forced to say what it is they stand for.  I would disagree with Senator Moynihan to the extent that I do not think democracy at the moment is fun.  It is very boring when I go through the streets and I just see face after face.  I could not say what those people stand for.  I am fairly new to politics and came to it fairly late in life and I would not have had a clue when going in to vote.  I always voted but I never knew what any of the candidates stood for.  I was doing other things in my community which were valuable and more important to me.  I voted based on party and always voted Green but there are many people who want to know what that is and what the manifesto behind that is.  I would not have known who to vote for as a number two and number three preference.  This is not aiding us.  <\/p> <p>I have used posters and I return to the points made by Senators McGahon and Ward, who both mentioned Tidy Towns.  There are 152 areas in Ireland that prohibited posters in 2019.  That is happening, with or without us.  It greatly impacts on the people who are running for election in those areas.  This is one's local area, it is stopping one from putting up posters and yet one is a first-time candidate.  Do we think that that does not have an impact?  It does.  We cannot stop that, nor should we, because that is what the people want.  We have to find some way of regulating it that puts everybody on a level playing field because it is not fair, in any event.  <\/p> <p>If one is a newcomer, one absolutely, 100%, has to use posters.  I am glad that the Minister of State has admitted how difficult it was because there would have been some members of the Green Party would have said that here is Malcolm Noonan not putting up posters and putting us all under pressure.  It is very difficult to get over the line as a first-time candidate.<\/p> <p>I argue that if the incumbents and newcomers had to drop all of their posters, it would bring a level playing field closer.  It does not close the gap but incumbents already have a significant advantage on newcomers because they are putting up the posters and they are known.  As a newcomer when putting up posters, one becomes known in a small way.  This would encourage all of us to become a great deal more creative if we took a step back and said that this is not what elections or politics are about.  Politics is actually about representing people properly.  I go back to the statistics that I raised earlier which state that the majority of people do not want posters and do not notice what is behind that poster.  We are not, in fact, doing a service.  Of course, the people inside this Chamber love posters and the razzmatazz because they love elections but the majority of people out there are not similarly engaged.  <\/p> <p>I have come from other elections in other countries where they have posters.  I was in Hungary for the recent election there, doing election observation, and there were posters.  I was in an area of a city in Hungary comprised entirely of the Romany community and the turnout was very low.  We waited there for 40 minutes and only one person came in to vote in that period of time.  Posters were up but they were not engaging people or reaching out across the divide and closing that social barrier.  It was doing none of that.  A great deal more has to happen in order for us to close that divide.  <\/p> <p>That is why the electoral commission is critical and is a critical part of what happens in government.  I do not want that this important issue in respect of the environment is also forgotten about and that we somehow say that this is the essential thing in promoting democracy, which is that we just throw up posters everywhere.  No, it is not.  The two things need to happen together and we need to take our responsibility as climate leaders seriously now.  We have a responsibility.  Yes, it was the Green Party in previous elections that went to the doors and we were kicked as to why we had posters up.  Our reply was that it was because Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have them up so I will otherwise stand no chance.  All parties are going to be asked those questions as to why they are putting up posters in the coming years because people care about the environment and are sick of it.  They do not think this is representing their views properly.  I thank the Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#OO00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652794200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652794200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652794200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 6.28 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 7 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 6.28 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Childcare Provision: Statements","time":1652794200,"counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#SS00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the important issue of early learning and childcare.  It would be difficult to overstate the importance of early learning and childcare to society, the economy, parents, but most importantly, to children.  Recent years have seen an unprecedented growth in the level of State investment in early learning and childcare, and in the numbers of children in receipt of State supports to access these services, including children with disabilities, who are being supported through the award winning access and inclusion model, which has been recognised internationally as a really strong practice in terms of supporting accessibility to early learning and childcare.<\/p> <p>Despite the major progress that has been made, significant challenges remain.  The level of State investment remains low by international standards.  The level of pay and working conditions in the sector does not reflect the fundamental value of the work that childcare professionals, who are young and nearly all women, do and the significant time they invest in their own education to achieve level 7 and level 8 degrees.  Fees remain unaffordable, particularly for families who are availing of long hours or who have a number of children in childcare.<\/p> <p>This Government is committed to addressing these challenges.  We have set out an ambitious programme of reform for early learning and childcare through commitments made in the programme for Government as well as other key policy documents, including Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for the Sector; Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care; the National Action Plan for Childminding; and the First 5 strategy.  We have backed up these commitments with significant additional investment in budget 2022 through the introduction of a new &euro;221 million core funding scheme and we have pledged to reach an annual investment target of at least &euro;1 billion by 2028.<\/p> <p>We all know that poor pay and conditions undermine the quality of early learning and care provision.  Just last week, I published the annual early years sector profile 2021, which revealed the average hourly rate pay in this sector was &euro;12.60.  While my Department does not set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector, it has over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.  These include higher capitation payments for graduates working in the sector and year-on-year increases in State funding.  These supports make it easier for providers to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts to their staff.<\/p> <p>In December 2020, I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a joint labour committee, JLC, for the sector.  That process culminated in the establishment of a JLC in December 2020 bringing with it a real prospect of addressing this perennial issue, particularly with the backing of that additional investment by the State through core funding to improve rates of pay across all roles in the sector and a further &euro;38 million graduate premium in respect of graduate lead educators and managers.  I acknowledge the independent nature of the Labour Court and JLC process and the hard work of its members to negotiate pay and conditions for employees in the sector.<\/p> <p>The first stage of the work of the JLC has been completed with the recent publication by the Labour Court of a recommendation for an early years' educators and school-age childcare practitioner minimum pay rate of &euro;13 per hour.  A draft employment regulation order, ERO, was published by the JLC on 11 May 2022.  There is now an opportunity for anyone interested to make representations to the JLC by 31 May 2022.  The JLC will consider any representations it receives as part of its deliberations.  The JLC must now decide whether to formulate proposals for an ERO for early years educators and school age childcare practitioners based on the Labour Court recommendation and also to consider its next steps as regards the other roles in the sector and whether there is potential to secure consensus with regard to these roles as regards pay rates and graduate uplifts.  I have been informed that the Labour Court sat last week in respect of a referral from the JLC on the outstanding issues for a further ERO for other roles in the sector.  The court's recommendation is awaited.  The JLC will continue to meet and exercise its statutory function with a view to formulating and potentially adopting proposals for one or more EROs in the sector.<\/p> <p>In addition to supporting the JLC, core funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver.  Core funding is based on operating hours, number of places offered by services and the age group of children for whom the places are offered and, therefore, is proportionate to each service's operating costs.  Structuring core funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance, as happens with the other Department funding schemes - the NCS and ECCE.  With recent data from Pobal showing significant unfilled capacity across the sector, core funding should bring increased funding certainty and stability to providers.  A very small number of providers, 1% in total, will have the same level of State income under core funding as under the current funding arrangements.  These services have the highest levels of public income from the existing funding schemes.  To ensure that no service will lose out through the introduction of core funding, I have committed to the funding guarantee under which no service that signs up to core funding will face a reduction in State funding.  Full-time services and part-time services will see substantial increases in funding.  Sessional ECCE standard capitation services will see an increase in income of at least 9.5%.  Most ECCE higher capitation will also see increase in funding.  No service will be left out of pocket.  In addition, there will be a sustainability fund attached to core funding to provide an extra safety net for providers.  Unfortunately, some misinformation has been circulated about the implications of the funding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In particular, there have been suggestions that small services and services which only provide the ECCE programme will lose out.  My officials have examined the evidence carefully and are satisfied that core funding does not create sustainability problems for services.  Indeed, it will substantially improve the sustainability for the overwhelming majority of them.  We have strong evidence to indicate that the ECCE in addition to core funding provides more than sufficient funding to cover the operating costs of sessional preschool services.<\/p><p>I am very encouraged by early indications of willingness to participate in the partnership for the public good, which is on offer through core funding.  Already 92% of services have agreed to freeze fees in advance of core funding by signing up for the transition fund.  Approximately 83% of providers have also completed the sector profile survey, the first step required for coming into contract for core funding, and more will have the opportunity to do so next month.<\/p><p>My officials and I continue to engage with representatives of some providers who have concerns in order to better understand these issues.  However, it is important to be clear that the Department will not be accepting proposals made by sectoral representative groups to extend the scope for additional optional extras or voluntary contributions to be charged to parents whose children are participating in the ECCE programme.  It is my view that this risks parents incurring additional charges for a universal service which is designed and intended to be free at the point of use and available to all families, regardless of ability to pay.  This would be entirely contrary to the spirit of the programme.<\/p><p>I am happy, however, to make very clear my view about the centrality of the ECCE programme within the new funding model for the sector.  The view of the expert group was unequivocal about ECCE being a fundamental component of the funding model in future and I was happy to bring its recommendations to Government and receive full approval.  I will shortly award a contract for a review of the ECCE programme, which will prepare the ground for putting ECCE on a statutory footing, demonstrating the commitment to fully-funded preschool provision.<\/p><p>Core funding introduces a new fee management scheme that will maintain fee levels this September at the same level they were in September 2021, ensuring the cost of early learning and childcare to parents does not increase.  This a step change in how we resource this sector.  With these fee controls now in place, the real cost of early learning and childcare to families is set to reduce further this year through two national childcare scheme measures introduced under budget 2022.  The end to the practice of deducting hours spent in preschool or school from the entitlement to national childcare scheme subsidised hours is benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low-income families.  I introduced this on 2 May, ahead of schedule.  The national childcare scheme universal subsidy will be extended to all children under the age of 15 from September.  This is worth up to &euro;1,170 per annum and will benefit up to 40,000 children.  The Government is committed to further investment through the national childcare scheme in budget 2023 to substantially bring down the cost of early learning and childcare for parents.<\/p><p>I commend the work of early learning and childcare services in assisting with the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  The Department has developed a comprehensive action plan to respond to the early learning and childcare needs of Ukrainian children and their families but it would not be possible to implement it without the enthusiastic support of providers.  The Department is providing a range of supports to help the integration of Ukrainian families, including providing information, supports and practical resources for them.  We are identifying vacancies for Ukrainian children in services nationwide.  We have increased grants for local parent and toddler groups to help them to welcome Ukrainian families.  We are providing training and resources for early learning and childcare providers to help them to support Ukrainian children who attend their services.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the clear and significant challenges facing the early learning and childcare sector.  These challenges are something on which many of us will agree.  Fees are unaffordable for many parents.  The level of pay for those working in the sector is too low.  There are issues of supply among certain cohorts of children and in certain areas.  The Government is committed to addressing these challenges, as I have outlined, through improving pay and conditions, reducing fees and increasing the availability of quality early learning and childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#SS00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his work to date.  This is a tricky sector.  I have started a preschool, a school, after-school programmes and parent and toddler groups so I have experience of the challenges, costs and difficulties that parents face.  The Minister has probably been the most successful to date in grasping the nettle and addressing the situation.  It has been very difficult with the cost-of-living increases.  The are some important highlights I want to talk about.<\/p> <p>The number of services that closed in 2021 was lower than in previous years.  The number of staff in the sector held steady.  The additional costs of operating during Covid-19 were not passed on to parents through increased fees, meeting an important and shared objective of the State and providers.  I have always said that we have it all wrong.  We pay the lecturers the most and the childcare workers the least.  It is in the first few years of life that people are the most impressionable.  We really need to value childcare workers more.<\/p> <p>I welcome the core funding.  It is additional funding for ECCE standard capitation.  The ECCE has been of huge benefit to parents as their children prepare to go to school.  Having two years of preschool is hugely beneficial.  The total fund is &euro;221 million.  The Minister secured &euro;78 million additional funding in last year's budget.  This is brilliant because it is what we need.  Of the &euro;221 million in the new core funding the Minister has secured, &euro;138 million is to support staffing costs and improve pay and conditions.  The Minister witnessed the gratitude the head of the cr&egrave;che in Inagh had for him on the day he came to visit the brilliant childcare services there.  She was grateful to the Minister and it was so nice for a Minister to get appreciation.  She is very apolitical and a great childcare operator.  She was genuinely grateful for the work the Minister has done in helping her with staffing costs.  It is very hard for staff to be motivated if they are not paid and valued properly.  I have to hand it to the Minister.  He has done great work.  I have also been to other childcare providers who are very grateful for the work the Minister has done on this.<\/p> <p>There is also &euro;25 million to support administration.  This is a huge issue.  Many childcare providers have said they and their staff end up spending so much time dealing with administration rather than with the children.  The funding of &euro;25 million to solve this is very important.  Childcare workers want to spend their time with the children and not filling out forms and being up to their necks in administration.  It is excellent that the Minister has dealt with this.  There is &euro;20 million to reflect increases in non-staff overheads.  Everything costs more money these days.  I thank the Minister for looking at overheads and recognising this.  He has put money where his mouth is.  There is &euro;38 million to support the employment of graduates.  This is important.  We have had instances where people with a master's degree in childcare are on the minimum wage.  The Minister finds this appalling and has worked hard to try to rectify the issue.<\/p> <p>This is a new way to allocate funding in the sector.  It is a good model.  A lot of research has been done.  The Minister commissioned two seminal reports.  The first, Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, was done independently.  It was not done by the Minister, civil servants or a political party but independently to find a new funding model, which the Minister has taken on board.  The second is Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare.  I thank the Minister for his commitment to the sector.  It is very important that we value our children from a very young age.  Lecturers get paid to work with those aged over 18 but we have to look at the value we place on our childcare workers.  They really are our heroes.  They become another parent to very young children.  Young children are impressionable and it is important that we value our childcare workers.<\/p> <p>There is another issue I want to raise, which is not of the Minister's doing.  It is the school programme for children with special needs.  The funding has been put in place but many schools rely on their teachers for the summer programme.  Many teachers need their holidays.  Even though the money and venues are there, schools are struggling to find staff to run the summer programme for parents of children with special needs.  They need it the most.  We have to look at this and see who else we can get in and what staff we can access.  If teachers have had a long hard year and need their holidays, we cannot make them stay for all of July.  We have to find a new way around this.  I have been approached by many people with children with autism.  Funding is not the issue; it is the staff.  The Minister and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will have to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#TT00200","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and for coming to the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Leader and her office for organising this engagement.  Many Members requested a debate or statements on childcare and I thank the Leader for facilitating these statements on childcare provision.<\/p><p>It is important that we are increasingly learning of the importance of early experiences, development and learning and how critical that is to the ongoing development of children into young adults.  Of course, society itself benefits from early intervention in the context of how we care for, support and nurture children.  I do not need to tell the Minister about it; he knows it already, as do all present.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that there are issues in respect of childcare.  It is in crisis.  The Government has identified it as a key issue.  Along with housing and health, childcare and education are key issues on which the Government will be judged.  I acknowledge the enormous amount of work the Minister has done in this area but there is far more work to be done.  Childcare has become a political issue as well as a public one.  That is good.  It brings it centre stage, puts demands on the services and obliges the politicians to prioritise.  People have been talking about childcare for so long.  It is diverse, including services such as play groups.  We see the outcomes.  \"Outcomes\" is a recurring word when we are talking about children and childcare.<\/p><p>Play groups are the most widespread service in terms of early childcare intervention.  Some of them are informal, while others are more regularised and formal.  There needs to be some sort of uniformity in that regard.  I acknowledge the importance of community play groups.  They have a powerful and transforming effect on the lives of many women involved in running these groups.  That has been my experience.  Community play groups are an important resource, particularly in disadvantaged areas, not just for children but also for their mothers.  They enable people to meet the needs of their family.  Doing that collectively and together in a community is empowering and builds stable relationships going forward.<\/p><p>I refer to the concern in respect of waiting lists.  I think the Minister is going to deal with that.  More capacity and supply are urgently needed.  It is an issue of capacity and supply and those are key priorities.  There is also the issue of affordability, which is very important.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to address the relationship of his Department with county childcare committees.  I believe the latter are underutilised.  They are particularly effective groups.  I do not think they are in all local authorities.  I might be wrong.  Approximately 28 local authorities have a county childcare committee.  That is an issue.<\/p><p>There is another issue I wish to throw into the mix.  We need to consider a move to a zero rate of VAT.  VAT is charged on childcare providers.  I was not aware of that previously.  Childcare providers are also charged commercial rates, whereas early childhood care and education centres are not.  There are anomalies here.  We should take down any blocks in this regard.<\/p><p>Experience in community development tells me that parents working together form the nucleus of strong community development, as well as forming strong character and support in children.  That is important.<\/p><p>I know the Minister is doing a lot of work on this issue and there are many asks of him but I ask him to focus on how older children are being cared for outside school hours.  That is an important area.  What childcare arrangements and supports are being provided for Traveller families, recognising the particular needs of that group?  I refer to children with disabilities and children of migrant communities.  These are challenges.<\/p><p>There are streets in Dublin where one sees young children who are neither in school nor in play groups or otherwise supported.  There are young children having burgers and pizzas from cartons for breakfast at 8 a.m.  I have spoken to parents in parts of Dublin who are being put out of bed and breakfast accommodation and what is referred to as support accommodation.  It is not supportive or conducive to the personal, health, development and well-being of their children.  These are serious challenges.<\/p><p>I am deeply disturbed to see vulnerable children on the main streets of Dublin.  One can see them down on the boardwalks.  Their parents may have addiction or mental health problems.  In what way is the State supporting them?  I am not even talking about them having the luxury of a roof over their heads.  We have to consider that.  Too many children in this country are still at risk due to circumstances of social and economic disadvantage.  It is no fault of their own.  They have to be the priority.  It is not about the loudest mouth or the person who says he or she cannot fully afford it.  There are children on the streets at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. who have no supports.  They are vulnerable and at risk and they have to be our priority.<\/p><p>Childcare supply and demand are at crisis point.  It is important.  It is about an equal start for all children and improving outcomes for them.  It is about development of all forms - cognitive, communication and language, social and emotional, and physical.  It is about creating a safe and healthy environment for children, promoting active learning in a conducive and safe environment, positive parenting or guardianship, good mental well-being, knowledge, skills and the spoken and written language.  That is a hell of a lot but that is what we have to do.  Every child is entitled to an equal start.  I know the Minister is committed to that but somehow it has to happen faster.  The current situation cannot go on.  These children are our future.  They are the next generation.  If we have learned anything from all our discussions on the past and how the State cared for or failed to care for children, then we must do something positive for these children to ensure they have better outcomes. That is now within our grasp<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#TT00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  It is great to have him here.  He attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth earlier today.  I listened to the proceedings.  The Minister made a strong contribution on the Ukrainian crisis and I thank him for that.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on childcare.  We have to recognise the significant lived difficulties families are facing as a result of the lack of childcare and its significant cost.  The availability and cost of childcare is one of the biggest barriers to women going back to work after having children.  The ECCE scheme has been a great success.  The extension of the age criteria has been wonderful.  It is of such benefit to families to have that.  I would not have put my children into a preschool if it was not free to do so.  I was not working at the time, so it just would not have happened.  I refer to my personal experience.  When I wanted to go back to work after having children, it was not for me.  I could not afford it.  Why would I disrupt my family life by pulling my children out of bed at crazy hours and commuting to a job?  It would be living to work to pay someone else.  That did not make sense for me.  I was better off having no independence and no money of my own, but autonomy over my time and my children.  We cut our cloth and made things work.  That was my only option.<\/p> <p>It is not easy being a working mother either.  My youngest son is sick at the moment and when I was leaving my house this morning he was pleading me not to go to work.  He said, \"Dublin is closed today, mammy.  I hate Dublin.  Dublin does not need my mammy; I need my mammy.\"  It is so hard to leave your wee person behind.   No option is easy but we need to have options.  The option I chose meant that I felt that guilt as I walked out the door and left the Cooley Mountains.  The irony is that I could not afford to go to work and I almost could not afford not to work.  It is a difficult one.<\/p> <p>The State does not have a good record of paying due care to the caring economy.  I am glad there is more of a conscious bias towards this and a new focus on the importance of that care, as well as a realisation of the significant value and worth of the care that is provided.   I ask that the Department carry out research into identifying the percentage of GDP that is facilitated by the caring economy.  For example, what percentage of it is facilitated by grandparents who provide childcare?  They facilitate entrepreneurs and businesses and that leads to the generation of income tax.  We do not currently have those data.  <\/p> <p>Overall, I congratulate the Minister on his work in respect of childcare.  We came into this Government with a focus on seeing what can be done with childcare.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Erin McGreehan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I refer to getting stuck in to radically transform childcare.  We have started on that pathway.  We really have done so.  The Minister has the support of Fianna F&aacute;il in pushing this process so far down this path that it will not be possible to go back.  This is the way forward.  I refer to having core funding and to constantly increasing this core funding in every budget.  We must ensure we are moving towards the public provision of childcare, which we need.  We must put in the foundations for fair, public, accessible childcare in the communities in which people live and wish to be in.  <\/p><p>All childcare providers would say the support provided during the pandemic was incredible and that they would not exist now without it.  They would not have been able to keep providing services and to keep their lives going.  This is what we need.  We have seen what the Government can do and how best to do so.  I refer to more than 90% of expressions of interest being in favour of moving towards such a core funding model.  The provision of those pandemic supports has caused these providers to realise this is a good thing and that the Government is on their side and wants them to provide a good service.  They want to get on board because they know the Government is not out to get them, but instead wants to work with them.  This is a testament to the work of the Department and of the childcare providers in endeavouring to create this path forward.  To see this, we only have to look at budget 2022 and the core funding scheme, which allocated more than &euro;221 million to this area.  It is a colossal amount.  Of that, &euro;173 million is new investment.  That must be some sort of record for investment in any social service or provision.  <\/p><p>There are a few layers to this childcare cake.  We must ensure we have all the ingredients together to enable us to make progress in going down this path and to ensure we have the proper childcare provision that we want.  We must encourage new childcare providers to enter this sector.  There is a great need for growth in the number of providers in this market because there simply are not enough places available.  We now have an opportunity in this regard.  The census has been done and data are coming on where we are at, what we need and who we need, as well as where we need these elements, in the context of the provision of these services.  We must ensure costs are reduced dramatically.  Again, this is not a secret.  We all know this is necessary and that the Minister is working on it.  <\/p><p>We must also reimagine the childcare sector.  It is early education and the people working in the sector are professionals.  It is not babysitting.  These are qualified people.  It is incredible what they have done for my children and the benefits they have derived from these services.  I could speak all day on the topic of childcare.  So many positive things are going on.  The Minister has our full support in creating this public childcare system, which we all want and need.  I refer to there being better pay and conditions for the staff.  We must look after our children and the staff.  A healthy childcare service is a healthy child. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#UU00200","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for her contribution and for recounting her interesting personal experiences of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#VV00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for taking these statements on childcare.  We have long since moved on from the concept of childcare as childminding.  We see it now as the vital, wrap-around care of children, entailing the provision of and support for their early development.  Childcare is pivotal to the functioning of our society.  That was never driven home more at any point than during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>The first 1,000 days of a child's life require incredible levels of investment and support.  Families must be supported as they live their lives in our busy society and economy.  The pandemic gave us the perspective that allowed us to see just how pivotal childcare is.  Quality care for our children enables access to the workplace for parents and supports families.  Predominantly, however, it enables support for women and their access to the workplace.  It is extremely important that it is entrenched in the programme for Government.  We have been on a trajectory of increasing supports for childcare over several years.  Under the Minister's stewardship of the Department, we have seen that provision grow exponentially.  I am grateful for that.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to see the profile of childcare raised.  I refer to the professionalism evident in this context.  When the preschool regulations changed in 2016, we saw great momentum in moving towards developing qualifications in this area, quality input, tracking development and having bespoke responses for certain children.  I was a mentor with the city and county childcare committee in Dublin.  That entailed going into many of the services being provided to see the detailed level of support being provided for children.  It perhaps reflected the needs of the families concerned.  It is a vital personal support for our next generation.  The Minister is aware of this and his speech highlighted just how much is being done in this area.  Staff working in childcare have been undervalued for a long time.  Their rates of pay did not improve as they became more professional and more qualified.  Therefore, the employment regulation order is a vital extra step.  It is a fantastic vision and its realisation cannot come soon enough.  <\/p> <p>Trying to retain childcare staff is important.  I refer to situations where I was perhaps sent in to troubleshoot difficulties in a service.  Many people who would have said they were going to come to an interview did not show up.  They were undertaking that process through Intreo, but it was not financially viable for those people to take a job in childcare.  I am glad we are moving away from that situation and that we will see structured rates of pay for the different areas in this sector.  It is not just the rates of pay that are important, but also a structured career path in the childcare sector.  I see us as having embarked on this path.  <\/p> <p>This is a precarious enough time for childcare providers.  We did not know how remote working was going to go.  We did not know if that would change the pattern of working or how it would be possible to make available the childcare services offered.  I say that because a great deal of childcare relies on structure, structured hours, children arriving at a particular time and on routine in that regard.  I refer to anticipating what that context will look like and then having universal provision that will ensure that no matter where people might be in the country they will have access to good quality childcare.  This is an important aspect.  From that perspective, the core funding approach is an excellent model.  Even going through the notes we sought regarding extra information, it is apparent it is an excellent model.  <\/p> <p>I have come across one challenge in this context.  Based on what the Minister said in his statement, I think there is probably going to be a positive response to it.  I refer to situations where I have gone through the procedure with some childcare providers as they entered the details of their services through the ready reckoner.  They came out with a great amount of money at that stage.  When one provider went through that process, she said the ready reckoner gave her a total of &euro;39,800.  That was for a small provider.  Representatives of the city and county childcare committee then did the calculations with her manually and they were only coming out with &euro;18,200.  That is quite a disparity, and it would lead to the end of that service if it were to be the case.  Obviously, everyone is optimistic and hoping the ready reckoner is spot on, but we must be absolutely clear that either the ready reckoner outcome is the definitive funding allocation or that clarification will be provided if there is some kind of misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding how funds are being calculated.  This is important.  I refer to where there are disparities.  This has happened in the cases of a few childcare providers I have spoken to, so clearly something is going on in this regard.  It is unfortunate that there has been misinformation regarding what is a very positive development.  <\/p> <p>I spoke to the Minister before about after-school services, especially those in Dublin 8, and about ensuring there is provision in this regard, particularly in situations where mothers are at home.  There are some cases where children are going to DEIS schools because that is the need.  Therefore, it is important to have after-school services available when children are doing their homework and to ensure such services are financially viable.  I appreciate these services are also going to come under the auspices of the core funding model and I would value an opportunity to go back over this issue again with the Minister at some point.  <\/p> <p>I also take this opportunity to thank the Minister for allowing myself and other members of the Fine Gael policy lab to present our \"Care of the Child\" policy to him.  It was the result of 2,500 people engaging with us.  Those included providers, parents and childcare professionals.  One of the many things that came out of the process was this idea of having a childcare agency.  I am delighted that the report from Indecon International Economic Consultants on the review of the operating model has suggested something similar.  I refer to having a central agency that oversees the inspectorate, education and funding and development.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When there are planning applications in my constituency of Dublin South-Central and there is a requirement to have a childcare facility within that because they reach the criterion of the number of apartments in a complex, they get to set aside the need based on there being a certain number of places in local cr&egrave;ches.  I appreciate that is a Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage issue and is not something the Minister can control but while he is at Cabinet, he might have a word.  The criterion according to which the need to provide a childcare facility is set aside is incorrect because there can be a childcare service close by but it is full to capacity and has a waiting list.  That would assist in the Minister's drive for more facilities and places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#VV00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I commend some of the previous speakers, including Senator McGreehan for speaking personally.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has been at four or five events today and probably more besides.  We appreciate his coming to the Seanad and always giving time to hear our contributions.<\/p> <p>For years, childcare and the early years sector have been underfunded.  This State last year was ranked one of the lowest EU member states for investment in this area.  The resulting burden on families raising children is immense.  Household finances are under stress and childcare fees for parents are among the highest in the European Union.  A report by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, titled The Social Wage, just published, states that the average couple spends 20% of their joint disposable income on full-time fees for two preschool children and that this is a bigger share of the family budget than is typically spent on housing costs.<\/p> <p>The issues in childcare amount to a significant barrier to employment for women.  The high costs force many parents, especially women, to leave work to care for children at home.  All European welfare systems were built on the assumption of women as carers in the home.  From the 1950s onwards, that began to change but gender stereotypes are still part of policies here.  Ireland has one of the lowest rates of working mothers in the EU 27 alongside Italy, Greece and Spain, with one third of women with children outside the workforce.  At the same time, as has been mentioned, the 30,000 people in the early years sector are some of the most highly qualified professionals in our economy but are paid some of the lowest wages of any sector.  Many earn the minimum wage, which is an insult to any worker.  What does it say to primarily women carers that we pay our childcare and early year educators some of the lowest wages of any sector?  Entry-level wages must increase to the living wage.  The public sector should become a living wage employer.  The benefits have been outlined.  Doing this, particularly in childcare, would show we value childcare and the people who work in it and make it an increasingly viable long-term career choice.  UNICEF has recommended that public spending and investment in the early years sector be at least 1% of GDP.  If we move to get that investment, we can ensure we have a maximum weekly childcare fee and gradually reduce it until childcare is free at the point of use.<\/p> <p>The Minister has given substantial time to the Pobal sector profile, published last week.  It shows that early years educators earn &euro;12.10 per hour on average and many earn the minimum wage of &euro;10.50 or just above.  Managers earn around &euro;16.35 per hour, while many earn less than that.  That is bad for workers and providers.  It means qualified professionals are struggling to make ends meet and do not see a future for themselves in the sector.  Low pay also means providers struggle to recruit and retain staff, undermining the sustainability of services and causing some to close.  I acknowledge the core funding of &euro;138 million to improve pay and the &euro;38 million for graduate uplift.  These are welcome investments and it is essential they are implemented this year.<\/p> <p>I have three questions.  What does core funding mean for preschool services?  If providers are unsustainable, what measures will the Minister put in place to support them?  For those who do not sign up to core funding, what does it mean for those services, parents and staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#WW00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan touched on Traveller, migrant and disadvantaged children.  I want to make clear that those children are not the problem.  Sometimes it is not what we say but the way we say it.  We need to be careful around funding and equal access.  I thank the Senator for bringing that to my attention today.  While we are talking about childcare, we are not talking about equal access to childcare services for poor people or those from ethnic minority groups.  I and my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group, Senators Black, Ruane and Higgins, are passionate about childcare, and they were passionate about it long before I came to the House.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister.  At its best, childcare keeps our children happy and healthy and helps them develop skills they need for school and throughout their lives.  As a parent, there is nothing more important to me than the safety and happiness of my children.  Still, for many parents, being able to afford childcare and even being able to find a place for a child can be a nightmare.<\/p> <p>I know this has been a priority for the Minister and I look forward to his reforms of the funding model for early learning and childcare.  I understand this funding model, as the Minister mentioned, will deliver improved services, better pay and conditions for staff and affordable childcare, as well as better matching supply to demand, addressing issues of disadvantage and supporting providers to be sustainable, so that people know they will have a job in two or three years and the cr&egrave;ches will still be there.  I welcome these goals.  It cannot happen soon enough because what we have had for many years is not working.<\/p> <p>During the last general election, childcare was already a serious issue for parents.  There is frustration among parents because of the problems they have had in accessing services for some time and the costs involved.  With all the respect in the world, I want to believe the reforms will do everything the Minister says they will and I believe everyone wants to see action on them.  Across parties and groupings, Senators want to see implementation.  From discussions I have had over the past two years on many issues beside childcare, I see that we lack, first and foremost, implementation.  We can have the best will in the world, but without implementation it is pointless having it on paper and it does nobody any good.<\/p> <p>I could talk about this all day.  When we talk about women's equality, as has been happening a lot lately, the core conversation around the table should be childcare.  If Senators were to look at me and my partner Liam and say which of us would give up our job for the children, it is more likely that it would be me than my partner.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eileen Flynn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I believe women would give up their job more quickly than men, and that is without getting too personal.  It is only an example.  A lot of the time there are hard decisions to be made within a family setting about childcare.  I believe childcare should be free.  It should be an essential public service for everybody and we see models of that at a European level.  We see this in Finland and, I believe, Switzerland.  I know that at least three European countries provide it for free.  It works and it is evident it works, and that is what we should do in this country.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Garvey, was singing the praises of the childcare services with which she was in contact.  When we are talking about childcare, again we do not speak about childcare services in rural Ireland.  People in rural Ireland work as well and in some cases, as we have heard from Senators here, it is extremely difficult to access childcare.  I invite the Minister to our community cr&egrave;che in Ardara, County Donegal.  If he takes that opportunity to visit Donegal, I also invite him to visit a Traveller-specific and Roma childcare service at the Donegal Travellers Project in Letterkenny that needs a lot of support when it comes to funding.  It would be a lovely event.<\/p><p>When we talk about women's equality, childcare should be at the heart of those conversations.  I genuinely hope with all of my heart that we provide free childcare for the many women, men and parents in Ireland.  I have heard it said that paying for childcare is like paying two mortgages or rents, and we all know how expensive rent is in Ireland.  We have many different crises within our society and I hope childcare can be one less.  I am sure it will be, and I hope it is one that is solved sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#WW00300","speaker":"1657","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I believe I am sharing time with Senator Maria Byrne but she is not here.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House and putting this matter on the agenda.<\/p> <p>It does not take long for me and my friends or any group of mums in whose company I am to get on to the topic of childcare and how cost and supply are such barriers.  At the moment, friends of mine who have babies say they cannot find a place in a cr&egrave;che for any child in the area under the age of one.  That is not a good position to be in if they want to return to work.  I appreciate we are doing everything we can to give people the option to stay with their children for the first year, if that is what they want, but the option is increasingly not there if they want to return to work.  In Castleknock we are talking &euro;1,300 per month for childcare, which is close to what I pay.  The cost of childcare still results in women dropping out of the workforce, particularly in the 25 to 44 age group and especially if they have more than one child.  That also contributes to the gender pay gap.<\/p> <p>We all know that when the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme was brought in, it was fantastic, but we have moved on since and the national childcare scheme has been introduced.  The Minister will introduce improvements to the scheme this year, which are very positive.  The new core funding scheme is also very positive, as is the commitment to increase it to &euro;1 billion by 2028.<\/p> <p>Capacity and supply are issues.  How do we ensure more childcare providers open up in communities?  The Minister and I both know they are not opening up in communities.  The town centre first model is something by which we could assist the opening up of more community infrastructure and supports, if that is an option.  The town centre first funding is linked primarily to the urban regeneration and development fund and the rural regeneration and development fund.  We are talking about using the town centre first option to reinvigorate towns and villages and move towards 15-minute cities.  Could childcare feature as part of this?  I know that, traditionally, they have been bigger projects.  Could the likes of this scheme and co-working hubs feature as part of these proposals?  If we are talking about bringing together local groups such as businesses, Tidy Towns committees and community childcare groups, I presume we are giving them a say in our urban planning frameworks, for instance, and that there would be access to more funding for things like community childcare, which could be not-for-profit.  Is that a potential driver?  If those funding streams are not a good fit and are not accessible, we should find some that are.<\/p> <p>On the issue of the buildings that Senator Seery Kearney mentioned, we have seen them as well and how they have been part of plans and then have not opened.  Another reason they have not opened is because some of those buildings have not been appropriate for childcare facilities.  If we are going to make it mandatory that there is provision for childcare services in a development, then we must make sure the buildings are suitable.<\/p> <p>I wish to ask about the 26 weeks of unpaid parental leave.  At the moment a person can avail of it in one continuous block.  He or she can ask for it from his or her employer, and while the employer can postpone it for six months, he or she must give it to the person.  It is stronger than a right to request flexible work.  It is a right to have flexible work.  A person can get unpaid parental leave in one continuous block or in two with a certain amount of time between the two of them.  At the same time, a person can ask for the leave to be divided up between hours and days, but an employer can refuse that and it is entirely at his or her discretion.  Have we not moved to a stage where we should amend the unpaid parental leave Act to say that, under the same strength of provision, a person can access flexible working, whereby, for example, he or she can work four days a week under that entitlement as well?  It is the strongest entitlement there is in terms of access to flexible working.  Could we amend it?  I am out of time, and I have more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#XX00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being with us today.  A little bit of the feedback I have been getting locally on the funding models we are seeing in childcare, and perhaps the Minister might comment a little on it, has been around the idea that smaller childcare providers can still survive with this new funding model.  I know it may be challenging in terms of having to expand their premises or being able to take on more staff, but perhaps the Minister might have some comments about how we can protect smaller childcare providers in rural areas.  The challenge they sometimes have is that populations can fluctuate, with there being more children in some years and families suddenly moving out of or moving into an area, with the result that there can be a lot of changes.  It can be very difficult for independent small providers to manage that, so perhaps the Minister might have a number of comments on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Childcare is crucial.

I have had to go to him about a number of issues and he has always been very responsive.  I believe he places a very high value on childcare, including in the early years.  This can be seen in the changes and improvements being brought about by this Government.  In particular, I welcome the changes to the national childcare scheme, particularly how they apply to those who are socially and economically disadvantaged - the children who need support the most.  I thank him for taking the time to engage with the community childcare service providers from the north and south inner city of Dublin.  They really valued his time.  He listened to them and took the issues on board and he and his Department worked with them.  I am not suggesting that everything is done but I acknowledge that and thank the Minister for it.<\/p> <p>The increase in the ECCE hours, the increase in maternity and paternity leave, the increase in core funding and the commitment to get to &euro;1 billion per annum by 2028 are really welcome.  They signal that this Government recognises that there is a crisis arising out of how we provided childcare in the past and is seriously committed to improving that.  We all recognise that childcare is important, not just for children and their parents but also for childcare workers and our economy generally.  This debate should also be framed in the context of what is the debate of the moment, namely the cost-of-living crisis about which everybody is talking and with which everybody is crippled.<\/p> <p>There are three elements - access, affordability and value, and sustainability.  By access, I mean being able to access childcare.  Every childcare service provider in Dublin Central has a waiting list.  Every parent with a child who is considering going back to paid employment outside the home has to really battle with and take on the enormous challenge of securing a childcare place.  You are at a really vulnerable point when you have just had a child, particularly if it is your first child.  You are learning on the job and you have this push-pull.  On the one hand, you want to go back to paid employment but on the other, you have this enormous life-changing responsibility.  When you are going to trust strangers to mind your child, it is a mind melt and a heart melt for parents.  On top of that, there are very few places so your choice is limited.  You cannot be selective, choosy or critical.  It is a real crisis for new parents.  The north-east inner city, which is only a little pocket east of O'Connell Street reaching as far as Seville Place, has about seven childcare providers.  These are community childcare providers - not the full gamut.  They can provide about 450 places and have a waiting list of more than 350.  There are almost as many children on the waiting list as there are in the childcare services so it is a massive crisis.  I cannot overstate this.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister is aware of this because he is engaged with this issue but we must keep in mind that within that same area, there are more than 11 facilities providing services for and welcoming Ukrainian refugees.  There are about 1,000 Ukrainian refugees in the north-east inner city alone where there are already as many children on a waiting list as there are in childcare services, where we are already providing 60% or 70% of all the emergency homeless accommodation and where there is less than 10% home ownership.  We know that two thirds of the Ukrainians coming here are women and children.  There are roughly 1,000 of them in the north-east inner city, an area that is already bursting at the seams.  I know the Minister is engaged in this but I provide this example because it is a real-life example.  I know people talk about their towns and villages.  This is my town and village.  This is my community.  We want to welcome people.  We want the Ukrainians who come here to have a positive experience but when we cannot get childcare places for our own children, it sends the wrong message.<\/p> <p>The cost of childcare is roughly &euro;20,000 per year.  You must earn in excess of that.  That is &euro;20,000 after you have paid your taxes, so you are talking about &euro;30,000.  It is a second mortgage.  In the north inner city and Dublin Central, people are paying the most in terms of rents and property prices.  I know the Minister and the Government get it, but we must go further, particularly in terms of affordability and the cost-of-living crisis.  I urge the Minister to urge his colleagues in government to introduce a tax rebate for parents.  They need it.  They need a tax rebate.  The Government needs to make it affordable in addition to continuing with core funding.  We need both.  We are spending less than 0.5% of our GDP on childcare.  We all value it and say it is necessary.  We all know the dividend it pays in the future is enormous.  As a country, we need to make that firm commitment to it.  I urge the Minister to urge his colleagues in government to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#YY00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The Minister and I met recently to discuss my views on the Government's childcare policy.  A lot of good things are happening.  I have spoken to a number of providers, predominantly across County Mayo where I engaged with all providers in the county.  Most of them are saying that it is good to finally see a commitment to core funding for childcare and an acknowledgement that it is an important service.  As I said to the Minister previously, many providers that provide nothing more than the ECCE are not entirely happy with what is being proposed.  They expected it to go further and feel that it is not quite meeting their costs.  Some providers have told me that they are not sure if they want to continue operating in the system so there is probably more work to do with those providers to bring them with us because as Senator Fitzpatrick has just outlined, there is a shortage of places and we cannot afford to lose any providers.<\/p> <p>Speaking about the wider policy on childcare provision, I appreciate that the Minister came in at a time when we essentially had private providers providing childcare in the country.  We are now trying to in some way turn that into a public system, although it is still a private system.  We must ask ourselves whether retrofitting the current private system to give it the look of a public system is the right way to go.  It is probably the quickest way to reduce costs for parents and stabilise the sector but I question whether it is the right way for us in the long term.  At the end of the day, and I have no difficulty with this, private providers are there to make a profit as well to provide excellent childcare services, which they do.  We want to do two things.  We want to improve pay and conditions for those working in the sector and we are trying to do this through core funding.  I get this and I think they welcome that.  Certain providers are saying that because of the way the system is being changed, there is a disincentive for those with a level 7 or 8 to go that bit further and that if you get a level 5 or 6, you might be as well staying at that level because the difference in pay is not that significant because of core funding.  <\/p> <p>Pay and conditions make up one aspect of it but we also want to reduce costs for parents.  The way we are proposing to do that is to provide core funding.  We are saying to private providers that we will give them core funding if they adhere to certain rules and guidelines set by us, one of which is that providers do not increase their fees beyond 2021 levels.  I get this.  We do not want to tell providers they can increase their fees at some point because many providers could quickly increase them this year and try to access funding next year so I get that.  The Minister is trying to cut it off.  However, what we are trying to do is to essentially control how private companies charge for childcare by dangling a carrot saying that we will give them core funding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will probably work for some, but again, the question is whether it is the right policy.  Is it the right way to go to have an essentially private childcare system that we are trying to make public through the backdoor?  If we are being honest, it would take us at least a decade to achieve a fully public system.  That is not desirable either because it would take us a long time to get to that point.  However, I have concerns that in the long run it will be very difficult for the State to reduce fees if we are trying to do that by offering core funding in return for not increasing fees.<\/p><p>I also want to come at the issue from the childcare providers' perspective.  I will cite two examples of providers my area, without naming them.  One of them has not increased its fees in seven years and the other has not increased its fees in ten years.  They are quite reasonably priced, taking into account the standard cost of childcare in the country, which is extortionate in comparison with other EU countries.  These providers are now dealing with rising inflation, like everybody else.  They are dealing with increased energy, insurance and running costs.  If they want to get core funding they cannot change their fees, which is an unusual position for a private company to find itself in.  Normally, if costs go up, they can be passed onto the consumer or client.  These providers cannot do that.  Some providers are saying they do not know if it is the right thing for them to do to sign up to the system.<\/p><p>I understand what the Minister is trying to do.  It is a difficult task.  The Minister has been handed a private system and has been told to make it public, effectively, and to curtail fees and increase wages.  The Government is doing that by investing in core funding, stopping providers from increasing their fees and, in time, increasing the money going to parents through the national childcare scheme.  The two should balance each other out.  However, we need to ask whether that is the right policy, long term, or whether we need to see a focus on public childcare that is run by the State.<\/p><p>A good friend of mine is an early years educator.  She did her level 7 degree 12 or 13 years ago.  She has been working in the sector for a long time.  In my view, and her view, the job that childcare providers do is akin to that of primary or secondary school teachers.  They are educators and teachers.  They are not just minding kids.  They are not just childcare providers; they are educators.  If that is the case, their salary should reflect that.  It currently does not.  It is probably because it is a predominantly female profession that until now it has not been recognised for the importance that it has.  I know the Minister has changed that.  His Department is doing fantastic work in acknowledging that the level of qualifications in the sector is exceptional.  That message is coming back to those in the sector.  They see that.  Early years educators feel that they are now getting the respect they need and that their wages need to reflect that.  There are issues in respect of sick pay and holiday pay, for example.  Some of those working in the sector are signing on during the summer.  They have a level 8 degree and they are signing on.  That needs to be addressed.  Is there any other profession where workers with a level 8 degree have to sign on, as standard, every summer?  Probably not.<\/p><p>Acknowledging that we have to address what is in front of us today, in the long term, I would like to see a move towards a public system where early years educators are paid just like any other teacher.  They should be paid their salary, get their pension entitlements and get everything else that other teachers in the country do.  I want to see a system where the State has control over the fees that parents pay.  As it stands, we have a very delicate balance to strike in trying to curtail fees and basically retrofit a private system to make it look public when, in effect, it will always be a private system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#YY00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Before I get to the substantive issue of childcare provision, I want to take a moment to comment on the operation of this House.  I know we have done this many times of an evening here.  It is now 8.15 p.m. and the Seanad is due to sit until 8.30 p.m. tonight.  That makes it a very unfriendly working environment for family life.  When I began in the Seanad, there was a lot of talk about creating a family-friendly set-up and a family-friendly Oireachtas.  Obviously, the Ceann Comhairle is not here at the moment, but I hope he picks up the mantle again and addresses this issue in a meaningful way so that we can better accommodate family and general life balance.  I say that as someone who does not have children.  I spent the best part of last year as a carer for a sick family member.  Obviously, it is not the Minister's fault, but considering the topic, these late evening sittings are not reflective of a family-friendly work environment.  We want to see changes made in order to get more women and a more diverse group of people into politics.  Given that it is women who do the lion's share of caring for children and family members outside of work, it is not an ideal optic to have us all here in the evening.  However, that is neither here nor there.<\/p><p>Childcare provision is an issue that has faced workers for generations.  As previous speakers have said, there has never been a public childcare system that is sufficient to meet the needs of families.  Deputy Bacik has called for a Donogh O'Malley moment for childcare.  It is not just a catchy, zingy phrase.  There is real meaning behind it.  There is an opportunity now.  I know that the Minister has outlined his plans in this area.  We need to have a guaranteed publicly-funded childcare space for every child in this country.  If we expect people to be able to return to work or be available to work within a number of months of giving birth, it is unconscionable that we expect them to effectively pay a second mortgage to have their children taken care of.  For many, there is no way to pay it.  For many others who can manage it, there are not enough spaces available.  It is a bit of a double whammy.  <\/p><p>There are serious problems with Ireland's childcare system.  The Minister has outlined his plans for tackling some of them.  Places are increasingly limited and costs continue to rise for parents and childcare providers, despite early childhood care and education subsidies.  In the past two years, friends have often told me that they can only have one child or cannot have children because they cannot afford, or comprehend how they could afford, childcare.  They have told me how one parent would have to give up their job to care for the child.  We have a slightly perverse version of State-sanctioned family planning.  It is awful to hear such stories.  If people want to have families, they should be able to do so.  It is sad when I meet my friends and they tell me they cannot afford childcare or cannot comprehend how they could afford it.  They are begging, borrowing and stealing childminding hours from family friends and parents.  That is sad.  It is not how we should be doing things.  We have highlighted a lot of that today.<\/p><p>Currently, parents in Dublin can pay as much as &euro;1,000 per month per child, yet low wages are the norm for many of those working in the childcare sector.  It is no wonder that we read reports of women having to book their child's childcare place long in advance of the child's birth.  There is a scrum to get a place before the child is even born.  Providers are saying that places cannot be reserved until the child is born.  There is panic.  My friend told me she was nearly trying to register her child for a childcare place from her hospital bed.  There is a lot of pressure.  We need a new approach.  We need a publicly-funded, universal and affordable childcare scheme that is available to all.  That will require an enormous investment.  The Minister has outlined the investments he is planning to make and his plans for the sector.  As always, I do not doubt his commitment to the issue.  However, an ideological shift is required.  It is not just as simple as putting money into it.  The conversation is about whether to introduce a public, State-funded childcare system or to continue to try to prop up the system we have.  There is a difference between the two approaches.<\/p><p>In addition to the increased concern about the availability of places in future, with many childcare providers having closed during the pandemic, as has been highlighted, significant hikes in costs have also been reported as providers prepare for the new term.  The providers are under pressure as well.  Our society is only ever as strong as our weakest link.  We cannot wait to fix our care failures.  I hope the Government considers the Labour Party's proposal for a State-led childcare system that would improve the situation for parents, staff, providers and, most important, children.<\/p><p>My area of responsibility is further and higher education.  There are what are considered to be well-subsidised childcare places available in further and higher education, but there are not many.  It is a real pot luck situation for students applying for childcare places.  Over many years, I have heard stories of many students who have had to withdraw from their studies because of this.  Some parents cannot even comprehend being able to study.  I am firmly of the belief that everyone should be able to access education.  When young mothers, fathers and carers are saying they cannot do so and cannot afford childcare, it is sad.  We should not be limiting people's ambitions because we do not have the supports in place for them.  As I said, these people are wholly dependent on friends, family and neighbours to fill the gaps.  We might be taking the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child a bit too far.  <\/p><p>I wish to refer to the SIPTU Big Start campaign.  The rates of pay in the childcare sector do not reflect the level of professionalism, skills and qualifications of staff.  A colleague of mine, Eilish Balfe, tweeted the following:<\/p> <blockquote> \t33% of the Early years sector now hold a degree or higher.  Our sector has come along way.  It is a career, it&rsquo;s not just pocket money...  We upskill &amp;amp; strive to give children the best start in life.&quot; <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators for their detailed contributions.

It has a baby room, an ECCE service, school-age childcare and general childcare.  These services are all small but all elements are offered.  Those concerned were extremely happy with what was being provided under core funding.  Contrary to what has been said by some, core funding does not just benefit big services; it also benefits small services with several elements.  That is important to mention as an example.<\/p><p>Senator Flynn spoke about the importance of supporting rural childcare.  I am very aware of that.  Coming from a very urban area, I am very much aware that we have to support services in all parts of our country.  Senators Boyhan and Flynn spoke about children who are most at risk of disadvantage.  Senator Boyhan referred to some Traveller children and Senator Flynn referred to children from migrant groups and disadvantaged backgrounds.  A key step already taken is the removal of the wraparound hours.  That was really important.  We were able to bring in the arrangement early.  We thought we would have to do so in September but we did so in May.  It means that children with no parent in work or education will not be deducted hours during term time.  That is particularly important in school-age childcare.  The application of the former rule had a particularly negative effect on school-age childcare provision for Travellers.  The rule has now been reversed, which is really important.  The Senator and I discussed this in respect of services.  I discussed it with several service providers in Dundalk also.  This step taken was really important and significant.<\/p><p>On Senator Flynn&rsquo;s comments on educational disadvantage, I am very much aware that the take-up under the ECCE programme is 10% lower for Traveller children than children in the settled community.  I am really worried about that because, on day one in junior infants, a gap has already been created.  I am working on the early years aspect and also on the equality aspect.  The Travel and Roma unit is working on doing something to address this.  I am very conscious of it.<\/p><p>Senator McGreehan spoke about options.  They are essential, and that is why we have added significantly to parental leave to give parents the opportunity to stay at home in the first weeks.  When I started, the period of paid leave was two weeks per parent.  By July, it will be seven.  That is a really important extension.  By the end of this term, I hope to introduce the work&ndash;life balance Bill, which will introduce several important measures.  It will be tight if we are to introduce it at the end of this term.  At the end of this term, we might have one or two late nights with the Senators.  To refer to what Senator Hoey mentioned, I am afraid those evenings will not be work&ndash;life-balance evenings.  However, the work will be important.<\/p><p>The childminding action plan recognises that many parents rely on childminders.  It is a question of bringing them into the State system in respect of regulation but also in respect of access to the national childcare scheme.<\/p><p>Senator McGreehan is absolutely right about the professionalisation of the sector.  Several others have spoken about that also.  We have Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare 2022-2028 and we are seeking to develop that.  We are linking it with better rates of pay, which I will revert to later.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the support of Fianna F&aacute;il regarding further investment.  Core funding is the start.  It is a start, but a very significant start.  I remind those service providers that are concerned about core funding that this is year one.  We are seeking to build on it.  In next year&rsquo;s budget, budget 2023, affordability for parents will be my core focus.  I am referring to affordability through the national childcare scheme.  I disagree slightly on the point made on the scheme in that I believe it is the way to go.  This year, we are broadening it so every child between zero and 15 will be able to avail of it.  It used to be for those up to the age of three; now it will cover those all the way up to 15.  The scheme is designed to target all parents irrespective of their income group.  We just need to put the money into the scheme.  That is the most effective way to have a direct impact on what parents are paying.  It directly decreases the amount they pay for childcare.  That is much more targeted than using the taxation system.  When there is a high cost of living but also high inflation, a targeted approach like this one is really valuable.  I hope it attracts support across the House.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about the undervaluing of childcare staff in the past.  Senator Warfield and others also spoke about it.  That is why the joint labour committee and the employment regulation order were so important and why I am so happy we are seeing real progress in this regard.  A basic rate of &euro;13 per hour, which is higher than the living wage, will be set for the first time.  It is higher than the average rate of pay in the sector at present, according to the sector profile.  Further work is taking place within the joint labour committee to deliver other rates for those with more experience.  The Senator and I spoke about the joint labour committee quite a bit when I took on this role, so I am very happy with and really welcome the involvement of all the parties to deliver on that.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about supply but also about planning.  I was delighted to hear this was mentioned because, as it happened, the assistant secretary in the early years division, Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, and I had a meeting with several county and city planners yesterday specifically on the 2001 planning guidelines, whether they are delivering and how they can be improved.  It involved a call for housing, obviously, but I wanted to hear directly about the experience of planners.  We met planners from Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council and several others.  It was a really interesting meeting.  It was a first step.  Knowing the significant amount of housing that will be built privately and by the State in the coming years, the rule stipulating a childcare facility must be installed if there are 75 units and how the rule is not delivering &mdash; there are various reasons, some legitimate and others less so &mdash; it is a matter of determining how we can design the planning system to allow us to have more but appropriately designed childcare facilities as we expand the number of houses.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about the underfunded system and where we stand in the EU.  He is absolutely right in this regard.  It is important to note, however, that the OECD, in its review of Ireland, specifically noted the change in approach here, the additional investment and the research undertaken to chart a new direction.  The Senator asked several specific questions, including on services whose sustainability is still in question.  The core funding will address sustainability issues for the vast majority of services but we still have the sustainability fund for services in difficulty.  A service might have significant debts built up over a period.  The fund requires a service to open its books, which is understandable if the State is providing additional support.  The support is attached to court funding.<\/p><p>Services that do not sign up for core funding still have access to the standard ECCE capitation rates and the national childcare scheme.  They do not have access to the higher ECCE capitation or the programme support payment as they have been folded into the core funding service.<\/p><p>Senator Currie spoke about supply.  She is absolutely right.  The work we are starting with planners to examine the guidelines is part of the process.  Another element is the capital investment programme.  My Department has &euro;70 million under the national development plan for supporting capital investment in childcare.  Next year, we will be introducing an application programme for existing services that are seeking to upgrade or expand, and the following year we will be introducing a capital programme for brand new services.  That is how the roll-out will occur.<\/p><p>Another key element is core funding.  Core funding is designed to offer a greater reward regarding those elements of childcare that are most expensive, such as a baby room, recognising that the number of staff has to be much higher in a baby room and that the cost is much higher as a consequence.  Core funding arrangements recognise this and provide more where a service is providing a baby room.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan referred to population flux.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is another reason core funding is so important.  Core funding is based on capacity and not take-up.  Right now, the ECCE and the NCS are based on take-up.  We know from demographics that the population bulge is moving up and is now moving past the ECCE stage.  Many ECCE services around the country may find they are not filling 11 or 22 spaces.  Core funding rewards them for having 11 or 22 spaces.  If a service only has eight, or even seven, spaces this year, it will continue to be rewarded for its capacity.  That is an important point.  It provides stability in terms of overall supply.<\/p><p>I have spoken to the point made by Senator Fitzpatrick on accessibility in respect of the matters raised by Senators Currie and Seery Kearney.  In terms of affordability, the NCS is where we are at.  That is where I will make my push in this year's budget.  There is strong support across all Government parties.  This year, we have worked for services and childcare professionals.  Once core funding is signed up, we will deliver on that.  Next year, the focus has to be affordability.<\/p><p>I had a very useful discussion with Senator Chambers.  A significant part of core funding is focused directly on rewarding graduates.  We may need to be clearer on that, but it is very much part of the core funding element.  As I said earlier, this is year one of core funding.  We are only asking people to sign up for one year, and I ask services to try it for this one year.  The fee freeze is for one year and is linked to that.  Services should try it because it is where the focus of the Government is in terms of trying to support services.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Hoey on the guarantee of a childcare space for everybody, I must point out that we want to put the ECCE scheme on a statutory basis and ensure children will have a statutory entitlement to a two-year free ECCE service.  This recognises that ECCE will always be at the centre of our childcare offering.  I agree with her about a family-friendly Oireachtas.  Tomorrow we will be in the D&aacute;il until at least 9.30 p.m, and that is an early Wednesday.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have a lot more to do in terms of recognising that constant late-night sittings are contrary to what we are talking about in debates like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1652794200,"counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#BBB00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, back to the House once more.

This rate will, therefore, remain in place for these sectors until 28 February 2023 at an estimated cost up to that point of &euro;250 million.  The extension will cover the same goods and services as the original measure, which is to say, restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks and hairdressing, as well as certain printed matter such as brochures, leaflets, programmes and catalogues.<\/p> <p>I do not need to tell the Seanad that the tourism and hospitality sector was one of those most impacted by the public health restrictions that were put in place throughout the pandemic.  Through absolutely no fault of their own, bars, hotels and restaurants had to close on multiple occasions to allow our country to make its way through the very worst of the public health crisis.  The 9% VAT rate was introduced as part of a wide range of measures to respond to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in order to support the hospitality sector.  The Government has decided to extend the period when the rate will apply for a further six months.  <\/p> <p>I will elaborate on a final two areas of rationale for this decision.  First, I am very confident that as we move into the important summer trading period, many hospitality businesses will have a very active and successful summer.  What is important for all of them is to be in a position to have a good Christmas and a good start to 2023.  In particular, there needs to be clarity for the hotel sector regarding bookings, especially for tours and international tour operators as we move into the early part of next year.  They need to know where they stand with their pricing.  In order for them to know that, they need to have clarity regarding where they stand with the VAT rate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is why I believed an extension beyond budget day was merited.  If I had given an indication that this measure would run up to October, we would have found many businesses that were looking to put in place bookings - large bookings, I hope - approaching the middle of October but still unclear regarding where they would stand from a profitability point of view for the critical months of November, December, January and February.  That is the reason the Government agreed to my proposal for a slightly longer extension than we had done with other measures that are in place at the moment.<\/p><p>Second, I am also very much aware that, at the end of this month, we will see the conclusion of the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The Government made that decision and I remember bringing the measures into this House across the end of last year to change the employment wage subsidy scheme and to give businesses that were affected by the 8 p.m. required closure regulation an extra four weeks on the employment wage subsidy scheme.  That is coming to an end in two weeks' time, which will mean many businesses which were on levels of subsidy of between &euro;250 and &euro;350 on 1 December will exit from the subsidies entirely by the end of this month.  I expect that this decline in subsidy will be taken up by normal levels of trade as we have confidence about our economy being fully and safely open.  However, the Government still acknowledges that for many businesses, after a pretty harrowing two years of trading, that is still a significant change in the support that had been made available to them.<\/p><p>For all of those reasons, clarity regarding where we stand with the 9% VAT rate is needed now.  I believe the hospitality sector and all of its different elements are very important parts, not just of our economy, but of our society.  I had the privilege of representing this sector and being responsible for it for nearly two years as Minister with responsibility for tourism, and I know at first hand the challenge involved in running a restaurant or hotel and the intense difficulty that those running those businesses and working for them have faced over the last two years.  It is hard work.  It is an essential part of our economy, with one in ten employees working directly or indirectly for the sector, and it is a very important part of our society.  Through the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support scheme and this measure, I and the Government have shown a willingness to support this sector and to help it get back on its feet when it puts the Covid pandemic behind it.  That is what we are doing.<\/p><p>It is the final part of the jigsaw.  I hope to be in a position where I see restaurants and hotels all over our country have a really good summer and get set for a good Christmas.  At that point, the temporary rate will come to an end and, I hope, we will then be in a position where we will see our hospitality sector trading at the levels that it was before the sector and all of us got hit by the effects of the pandemic.  I am pleased in particular to introduce this amendment in the Seanad and I look forward to hearing the views of Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#BBB01200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the amendment.

It is an opportune time to compliment not only the Minister but his officials and the Department for the support that was put in place for the hospitality industry.  I happened to be at the launch of a degree programme involving a collaboration between the vintners and Griffith College yesterday evening, and I met many young apprentices who were going onto this programme.

I look forward to supporting the amendments he is bringing forward today.  If we think about the industry anywhere from Temple Bar in Dublin to the west coast and throughout the country, there is hospitality and bars, clubs and hotels in every village, small town and city.  I believe the industry is very grateful for the supports.  I think it is the right time to extend the 9% VAT rate because it will help them to get back to the 100%, given some are still not open seven days due to difficulties with staffing and different issues, although they are getting there.

We always get used to supports and we have to try to wean ourselves off them.  We are in a challenging position at the moment.  Senator Maria Byrne mentioned staff shortages and there is also the cost of living, so it is appropriate to try to extend the VAT rate into early next year to try to give that certainty and confidence to go into next year and to sustain and develop our product.  All I can do is thank the Minister from my family point of view and from a personal business point of view.  To follow on from Senator Maria Byrne's point, we would have failed too without the Government&rsquo;s support over the last two years.

I remember very clearly the discussions that we had in 2020 with some of the officials from the Department of Finance who are present today.  We got into very challenging discussions regarding what would be in and what would be out of the scheme.  I remember the discussions we were having regarding sports clubs and voluntary organisations in buildings that might have a bar in them.  We made the decision to have the criteria as broad as possible to facilitate businesses, not just those that Senator Casey knows well, but also organisations that may have had a few members of staff but would have had a bar that, in turn, provided the commercial revenue to help it to continue to fund its voluntary activities and look after its buildings, such as a rugby club or GAA club.  I am very glad we did that.<\/p> <p>If we look at where we are now, I hope the harshest economic effects of the disease are behind us.  However, it would be a poorer Ireland if we found ourselves in a position where we had a hospitality sector that was not able to open up, or if we found sporting clubs and organisations across our country no longer with us or no longer viable.  For all of those reasons, while the cost of these schemes was truly huge, and the employment wage subsidy scheme at times was &euro;500 million a month, nonetheless, it was an investment in our future.  That future is now opening up in front of us.

The purpose of amendments Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, is to provide further relief and support to hard-pressed households during this cost-of-living crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that the Government cannot shield everyone from every price increase.  However, we are fully aware that the Government can and should do more to support low- and middle-income households which, without support, cannot withstand these price increases without significant hardship.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 would reduce the price of petrol by a further 13 cent per litre, including VAT.  Similarly, amendment No. 6 would reduce the price of diesel by a further 9 cent per litre, including VAT.  Both amendments are consistent with the requirements of the excise directive.  Amendment No. 6 would require the temporary suspension of the diesel rebate scheme, but would ensure the benefits of the scheme would continue to be enjoyed by those who qualify due to the excise reduction provided by the amendment.  Similarly, amendment No. 8 provides for a further reduction of 3.3 cent per litre, including VAT, relative to April 2022.<\/p><p>Crucially, amendment No. 7 addresses the spiralling costs of home heating oil, which impacts on one in three households in the State and, if passed, would remove excise duty on a temporary basis and reduce the cost of filling a tank by &euro;118.  In the past 12 months, its cost has more than doubled, with the average price to fill a tank reaching a staggering &euro;1,700 in March 2022, and it will not get any better.  Many households simply cannot bear these price increases and they feel forgotten by this Government.  More than one third of households across the State use home heating oil as their main heating fuel.  These households have received no relief with respect to the cost of home heating oil.<\/p><p>A few weeks ago, the Government voted against a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment that would have removed excise duty from home heating oil and reduced its price.  Instead, the Government made it even more expensive with a further carbon tax hike.  That is wrong, senseless and places ideology above the realities facing workers and families.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 provides the Seanad and Minister with an opportunity to do the right thing and reduce the cost of home heating oil.  I ask Senators to use this opportunity to make a difference by voting for the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments and protect families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051700002#DDD01100","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1652794200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing forward these amendments.  I will say a word about each of them in turn.<\/p> <p>The amendments propose various further rate reductions from 1 May until budget day.  The Senator seeks to reduce the mineral oil tax rates on petrol and diesel to the minimum rates, as prescribed in the energy tax directive, and to further reduce the rate on marked gas oil by 2 cent.  The amendment also seeks to remove the carbon component on kerosene by reducing the overall rate to zero.  The proposed mineral oil tax rate for diesel would not be compliant with the minimum rate set out in the energy tax directive.  That is the key point.  What we are being asked to do by Sinn F&eacute;in is not allowable under the energy tax directive of the European Union.  We cannot do this.<\/p> <p>The combined effect of the measures the Government has already provided means that the current minimum tax rate for diesel, in addition to the diesel rebate scheme, is effectively at the minimum rate allowable under the energy tax directive.  Any further excise reduction, as the Senator is proposing, would bring the effective rate below the minimum permissible rate.  To apply a mineral oil tax rate of 33 cent per litre would mean the Government would have to scrap the diesel rebate scheme, which is a targeted support for hauliers and public transport operators.<\/p> <p>Mineral oil tax on kerosene for home heating has a non-carbon component rate of zero.  The carbon component is &euro;103.83 per 1,000 l.  In other words, there is only carbon tax on kerosene.  The Senator proposes to completely remove the carbon tax element, thereby reducing the mineral oil tax to zero.  Similarly, the reductions the Government has provided for in the rate of mineral oil tax and marked gas oil mean that the non-carbon component is zero until 12 October.  As there will only be carbon tax on the fuel, this means the further reductions in mineral oil tax proposed by the Senator would also involve reducing the carbon component on this fuel.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware of the Government commitment on carbon taxation.  We appreciate that the decisions made recently on fuels from 1 May were particularly challenging for many, but this is the reason the Government went ahead with measures to reduce VAT on gas and electricity.  The cash effect of those measures in reducing the VAT on those forms of energy will more than offset the increased price of home heating oil for households.<\/p> <p>For these reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendments brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Some of them are simply undoable and would involve a breach of European Union law.  In recognition of the difficulty and hardship some are facing as a result of the increase in carbon taxation in home heating oil from 1 May, the Government has brought in a set of additional measure which will have the effect of more than offsetting the impact of the change in carbon tax on home heating oil.
