We are here to discuss housing aid and housing adaptation grants.  I hope there will be some good news on a review.  I am dealing with these issues on a daily basis in Kildare and, unfortunately, the grants continue to cause a lot of problems.  It has been 13 months since I last brought up this matter and at that stage I was promised a review.  The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State, was in that day and he mentioned the fact that he was having a lot of issues with these grants in his constituency office.  He said that he was going to bring it back to the Department and to all Ministers to discuss the issue.<\/p> <p>Today, I am hoping to get an update.  As the Minister of State is well aware, the grants make a significant difference to the quality of life for so many older people and those with medical issues who need assistance.  We continue to see rising building costs.  These rising costs rule many families out of availing of these grants, as the maximum payment continues at &euro;30,000 for the housing adaptation grant.<\/p> <p>Over the last week alone, I have come across families with the cheapest quote of &euro;50,000 for a toilet extension and another for &euro;65,000 for a bedroom extension.  These families simply cannot afford the balance.  The work will not be completed and their loved ones will remain, in these two cases at least, without what could be life-changing extensions that would hugely improve their quality of life.<\/p> <p>Of course these are only two examples.  There are many others I could give.  I have contacted the community welfare officer service, which has helped in some cases.  Unfortunately, in a growing number of cases, the response has been that the county council is tasked with providing help with the costs associated with the adaptation of houses on medical grounds and as such it is its responsibility to provide the cost of this and that it would not be in a position to help with the cost of the project as the county council holds the responsibility in this matter.  This continues to be the response that I get in trying to bridge that gap for so many families.  Many of the families that I am dealing with just cannot afford the room that could make a difference.<\/p> <p>The limit for the housing aid grant is &euro;8,000.  More and more applicants are applying for window replacements, roofs and heating and they are finding that figure is nowhere near enough to cover the cost of the quotes they receive.  In a recent case I had, the quote was almost one year old because that was the length of time the local authority had taken to get around to processing the grant.  As a result, the applicants were asked to supply a fresh quote.  The price had risen by &euro;3,500 during the year and again, in this case, the applicant simply could not afford that rise and the grant, as the Minister of State knows, is limited to &euro;8,000.<\/p> <p>The problems have multiplied since last year.  Applicants, many of them older people, are turning to family members and credit unions to try to bridge the gap.  Due to their age, many people are not securing these loans.  The works allowed under these grants will allow an older population to continue living in their homes, where they want to be.  Unfortunately, the grant is means tested on its limits.  It is simply not fit for purpose anymore for many of these people.  Too many of our older people find themselves unable to access a grant which, at their time of life, is essential to their well-being.  I have said on countless occasions this grant is needed for all their work and their contributions to the State over so many years.<\/p> <p>The issues are having a knock-on effect.  In some of the cases I am dealing with, the applicants must remain in hospital because the family cannot afford the cost of the works to be done to their home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Excellent local authority staff dealing with these grants are inundated with queries from worried applicants, fearing that they will not get the work done on their homes.

The ever increasing waiting times for some of these grants are a worry, both at the beginning of the process and when payment is due.  In replies to parliamentary questions tabled by Labour Party colleagues, we were told that a review would be carried out at the end of last year.  I hope the Minister of State has come today with an update on that review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#A00400","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall for raising this very important issue and allowing me the opportunity to provide an update on the matter.  My Department provides funding to local authorities under the suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability, to assist people in private houses make their accommodation more suitable for their needs.  This also facilitates early returns from hospital stays.  The grants include the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability, the mobility aids grant and the housing aid for older people grant, which are 80% funded by my Department, together with a 20% matching contribution from local authority resources.  The detailed administration of these schemes, including assessment, approval, prioritisation and apportionment between the three schemes is the responsibility of local authorities.<\/p> <p>Funding of &euro;81.25 million is available nationally in 2022 for the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability scheme.  A further &euro;83.75 million has been allocated for 2023 continuing the overall year-on-year increases in the grant since 2014.<\/p> <p>The housing options for our ageing populations policy statement emphasised the Department's commitment to streamlining the application process, and ensuring that grants were more accessible to applicants.  Following stakeholder engagement, a revised single application form to cover these three grants, which was tested for plain English, was issued to all local authorities for implementation in early 2020, together with revised guidelines.  The Department continues to ensure full implementation of this new process by local authorities to deliver a more accessible grant application process as well as standardising the approach across all local authorities.<\/p> <p>In addition to this improved streamlining of the grants scheme, Housing for All commits to undertaking a review of the range of housing grants available to assist with meeting specific housing needs both for our ageing population and people with a disability.  The review is continuing within my Department informed by a focused stakeholder consultation process, which resulted in more than 40 submissions received from a range of stakeholders.  These included local authorities, the Department of Health, the HSE, Age Friendly Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, Jack and Jill Foundation, Independent Living Movement Ireland, AslAm, Family Carers Ireland, and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland.  Among things being considered under the review are income thresholds, grant limits, the application and decision making processes, and including supplementary documentation required.  The review will also consider the Cost of Disability in Ireland research report, which was published by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in December 2021.  The review remains on target to be completed by the end of this year.

My question is to ask him to make a statement regarding supports for tenants given notice to quit.  This applies especially to those in long-term rental, and who have been there for four, five or six years.  Many landlords have decided to leave the rental market as we are very aware.  It is a huge issue.  We have almost 4,000 people on our waiting list in Limerick, and up to now people like that had no other choice but to try to get somewhere else, or else go on the housing waiting list.  Will the Minister of State outline what supports are intended or have been introduced in recent times to support these tenants?  Many people are not aware of their rights and they may not have the best relationship with the landlord.  In many cases the house is genuinely being sold but in some cases people are using that as an excuse.  I am asking if there are any supports for people in that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#B00900","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this, which is a very important and pressing issue in society.  It is true to say we are seeing an increase in the number of people accessing emergency accommodation and the situation is proving very challenging.  The Government, local authorities and those in the NGO sector are making every effort to prevent and protect those at risk of homelessness.  Resources and funding are not an obstacle to the urgent efforts required.  Budget 2023 provided more than &euro;215 million, which is an increase of 10% on 2022, for delivery of homeless services.  This will ensure that local authorities can not only provide emergency accommodation, but importantly homeless prevention measures too.  It will also ensure they can support households to successfully exit homelessness into secure tenancies.<\/p> <p>Cognisant of the risk of homelessness faced by renters this coming winter, the Government recently legislated to protect them by deferring any no fault tenancy terminations from taking place over the coming months.  Analysis suggests this could prevent more than 2,000 tenancies being terminated.  This emergency measure is necessary and will provide assistance in the short term.  However, over the long term the answer remains an increased and sustainable supply of new housing.<\/p> <p>We will be adding significant social housing to our stock in 2022.  The quarter 2 construction status report shows 8,247 social homes on site, an additional 12,327 homes at design and tender stage, and a further 118 new construction schemes, comprising 1,647 homes, were added to the future pipeline.  Looking to next year, State investment of &euro;4.5 billion is in place to deliver a record 11,830 social homes, including 9,100 new builds, in 2023.  Supply as a whole is increasing.  Almost 28,000 new homes were completed in the 12 months to the end of September, which is the highest rolling 12 month total of any comparable period since comparable data were first published in 2011.<\/p> <p>In addition to our focus on increasing supply, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has introduced a number of measures to help those at risk of homelessness.  These include recent changes to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme to increase the discretion rate to 35% and expand the couple's rate to single persons.  This will secure and expand more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.  We have also legislated to increase the notice to quit period for no fault evictions.  The minimum amount of notice a landlord must give a tenant with a tenancy of less than three years duration before evicting them, has now increased from 28 days to three months.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has also made it clear to local authorities that where there is a risk of a tenant being evicted into homelessness, as a result of a landlord selling the home that the local authority will be supported to purchase the home, should that be appropriate.<\/p> <p>The delivery of cost-rental homes is also a key affordability measure under Housing for All, with State backed rents in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market.  Some 900 cost-rental homes have been approved in just over a year since this new rental offer was legislated for.  In 2023 a further 1,850 cost-rental homes are to be delivered.  The Government's ambition to deliver cost-rental homes at scale will transform the rental market, providing tenants with secure tenancies in sustainable, long-term homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#B01200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

Bans are not an answer in trying to ensure people get sustainable tenancies.  We have a small window in which to increase that scale and especially emergency accommodation provision, which we are working on.

This is technically a Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science issue, but this project incorporates the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as well.<\/p> <p>Kickham Barracks was closed in 2014 and since then a plan has been put forward by Tipperary County Council to revitalise the town of Clonmel.  Kickham Barracks plays a key role in that.  It was successful in its first phase of funding, which will be completed in the next month.  That is the open plaza area connecting the Showgrounds Shopping Centre to Parnell Street.  It is looking fantastic and, once opened and all the lights are on, it will be a wonderful amenity.<\/p> <p>The council put together an ambitious &euro;50 million plan under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, a year ago.  My colleague, Councillor Michael Murphy, was influential in pushing that forward with the council.  Last year, that application was unsuccessful.  Some Oireachtas colleagues said it was a disaster and a waste of time.  One Government Deputy blamed the application and said it was not up to standard.  None of that was true.  The main reason the application was not successful, rightly so from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was that there is a major educational development on the campus of Kickham Barracks and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science needs to play a role in financing it.<\/p> <p>In the last year, I have been dealing with the Minister, Deputy Harris.  He has been in Kickham Barracks, as have the Minister of State present, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  We have had almost every senior and influential Minister visit the barracks in the last year.  We have outlined what we have tried to do to get the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to support it.<\/p> <p>An application has been put forward by Tipperary Education and Training Board, ETB, in collaboration with the Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, to build a giant campus for higher and further education.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been talking for as long as he has been Minister for higher education about changing the stigma between further education and higher education and creating joint campuses so students are together, whether they are in higher or further education.  <\/p> <p>Kickham Barracks and a similar site in Mullingar are perfect examples of what we are trying to create in terms of joint campuses on one site.  This has the ability to revitalise the town but we need funding from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is in a process at the moment.  I know many applications have gone in.  I think there are about 30 applications across the country.  Few will be successful but this is a massive priority for a town that is very dependent on foreign direct investment and lucky with the type of jobs and job creation we have.  However, an area of the town, particularly the town centre, needs to be revitalised.  Kickham Barracks plays a key role in that.<\/p> <p>The funding the Minister of State and his Department provided a number of years ago and that the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, committed to was the first phase of that.  It would be an awful shame if the first phase was completed and nothing happened after that.  We have a new sports hub on the Clonmel bypass.  TUS is meant to come in to Kickham Barracks from where that sports hub is to be built but we need to get this over the line.  It is a multimillion euro investment from the Department of higher education, if it is willing to commit to it.  My fear is the applications are opening soon for the URDF funding and we need this money in before we can apply for that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#C00300","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ahearn for raising this important matter again.

The Minister, Deputy Harris, was eager to be here to respond directly but, unfortunately, had to attend Cabinet.<\/p> <p>The proposed development of a joint college campus between Tipperary ETB and TUS on the site of Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, is something I know the Senator has been pursuing for a significant period, including with the visit of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to Carrick-on-Suir.  At the heart of the proposal is collaboration between TUS and Tipperary ETB.  This is also at the heart of the agenda the Minister is pursuing.  A more unified tertiary system is essential if we are to meet the needs of learners, as well as of the economy and greater society.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, Tipperary ETB made an application to the further education and training, FET, college of the future major projects fund to develop an integrated tertiary FET-higher education campus in collaboration with TUS on the Kickham Barracks site in Clonmel town.  The Clonmel barracks connected campus is part of a wider network of integrated Tipperary ETB FET locations and is a sister project to a similar connected campus initiative with TUS in Thurles.  TUS is collaborating with Tipperary ETB on a proposal for a shared campus in Thurles.  This is being led by TUS, which has made an application under the technological sector strategic projects fund.<\/p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Harris, cannot go into further detail at this time, given the status of the technological sector strategic projects fund and FET college of the future major projects fund processes.  However, the Minister can assure him that this is a very important issue for the Department and it is keen to move matters forward as quickly as possible.  Evaluation reports have been submitted to the Department and the Minister hopes to be in a position shortly to announce the outcomes of both processes.  It is important that the Department balances strategic objectives for the development of TUS and the wider tertiary with ensuring value for money.<\/p> <p>I trust this update will provide reassurance to the Senator that support for TUS projects continues to be a key priority for the Minister, Deputy Harris, and his Department.

These are major issues for the people of Kinsale and the surrounding hinterland who use the bus service.  I have been trying to engage with the NTA for nine and a half months in order to ask its representatives to meet me.  They refuse to do so.  This is a Government-funded organisation and it is aloof.  It does not want to engage with the public or with the public representatives.  The NTA does what it wants, when it wants and has no regard for anyone.  What happened in this case is that the NTA relocated a bus stop from the bus station in Cork city to the side of a road in a dangerous location and with no shelter.  The bus drivers who operate the route turned up at the public meeting because they cannot stand over what is happening.  I wrote to the NTA again last week and I was told it did not have the staff to meet me.<\/p> <p>We have to decide what is happening with the State and how we can move things forward.  As an organisation, the NTA has a fantastic budget and is involved in licensing routes and providing services.  However, is does this in its own way.  If it is not done that way, the authority will not engage.  During the summer, the NTA tried to put a one-way system through the small village, Minane Bridge, from where I come.  When it did not get its way, it just pulled out.  We need to have a line of communication.  I am aware that he is attending a Cabinet meeting, but I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here because he has due responsibility to the public who elected him and to the Parliament.  He also has a responsibility with regard to the budget he puts in allocates to this organisation.<\/p> <p>The NTA does not give a damn about us.  Following my various correspondences with representatives of the NTA and in the aftermath of their refusal to meet me, I have been sent material from their liaison teams basically stating that there is nothing they can do and that the decision has been made.  That is not democracy; that is not what it is all about.  To think that, on a very wet and windy Monday night in Kinsale, we could fill a hall to discuss an issue like this shows the absolute outrage in the community.  I ask the Minister of State what process is in place to allow us to meet representatives from the NTA.  They do not want to meet me, the public or members of the council.  They will inform us what they are going to do.  This is a serious issue.  We have set up a quango that is now out of control and doing what it wants, when it wants.  As a result, there is no accountability.  The Minister is accountable.  He funds the NTA.  If he is not going to pull it back and establish a line of communication, we will go nowhere.  We need accountability and to know exactly what is happening.  I ask the Minister of State to give me a response to the question as to how I can meet representatives of this aloof organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#D00400","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I hear the frustrations he has quite rightly articulated in respect of his community and decisions that were taken.<\/p> <p>Public consultation should be at the core of decision-making processes of all State agencies.  There are a number of different ways in which the NTA meets with elected public representatives to discuss public transport projects.  At a statutory level, section 41 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 requires the chairperson and chief executive of the NTA to account for the performance of the functions of the authority to a committee established by either House of the Oireachtas.  This type of engagement with Oireachtas committees happens regularly.  Just yesterday, the NTA appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport to discuss the service delivery issues being experienced across the public transport network in Dublin.  In addition to this type of statutory engagement, representatives from the NTA regularly meet elected public representatives to discuss issues relating to publicly funded transport services and capital investment projects and various other matters under the authority's remit.  Public representatives who wish to request a meeting with the NTA can contact the authority's Oireachtas liaison unit to request such a meeting.  A meeting request will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the availability of the relevant NTA staff to facilitate such a meeting.<\/p> <p>As already mentioned, during these engagements with public representatives the NTA can discuss any issues relevant to their statutory functions.  As the Senator will be aware, the NTA has an extensive remit and plays an integral role in the implementation of public transport initiatives nationally.  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport service contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.  In its role as the public transport licensing agency, the NTA is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between it and the relevant operators.  In 2022, this amounted to &euro;538 million in Exchequer funding for public service obligation and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA.  More recently, &euro;563 million has been secured as part of budget 2023 negotiations for the continued improvement of these services.<\/p> <p>This year, the NTA has implemented a number of fare initiatives including the introduction of the young adult card and the 20% cost-of-living fare reduction on public service obligation services.  As Senators will be aware, the Government has ambitious plans for public transport infrastructure nationwide.  The programme for Government commits to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland and is supported by the national development plan, under which &euro;35 billion has been allocated to maintain, enhance and improve transport infrastructure across the country over the next decade.  The substantial investment in transport in recent years and the planned ramping up of major projects, such as BusConnects, in every city, Connecting Ireland in rural areas and DART+ and MetroLink means that the national public transport landscape will continue to transform for the better over the coming years.<\/p> <p>The NTA is the approving authority for these major public transport projects.  Funding for these and other rail and bus investment is allocated to the NTA by the Department of Transport and then provided to the relevant sponsoring authorities.  I hope this provides the Senator with an update on the processes and procedures around the NTA.  I also hope that his request will be responded to in due course and will result in a meeting with officials from the NTA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#D00500","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>There is a budget of &euro;35 billion, and the officials from the NTA will not meet us.

This is a quango that is totally out of control.  It has a process in place regarding how it responds to the Houses of the Oireachtas, but local councillors and communities and people on the ground cannot meet its representatives.  They are doing laptop studies in Dublin on infrastructural projects in Cork and they will not meet anyone to discuss them.  We have a major issue in the context of how this organisation was put together.  We all understand that public transportation is the key going forward, but it is about taking people on the journey with us.  The problem we have is the disconnect.  The NTA does not care about communities because it does not engage with them.  Eight months of asking for a meeting and I have got nothing other than the reply that it cannot afford it or cannot send a representative down to Cork.  Maybe it is a Cork thing and the officials do not want to come down.  Maybe they are based in Dublin and do not know where Cork is except for a spot on the map.  Will the Minister of State go back to the Minister for Transport and request that he, after eight months of me failing to get a meeting with officials from the NTA, ask the organisation he is funding to meet us in Clontarf Street to discuss how it can stand over moving the bus stop that was there without any consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#D00600","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I again thank the Senator for outlining the position in his community regarding the projects and the NTA.

I would take this opportunity to talk about a positive decision that has just been made by Cabinet in the last while about the north quays in Waterford city.  This is a project that many people have been involved in over the last six or seven years and there have been many false dawns along the way.  This morning, Cabinet approved over &euro;170 million for the public infrastructure elements of the project, which consist of the sustainable transport bridge over the River Suir, a new integrated transport hub, including the relocation of Plunkett Station, and new access roads and bridges onto the north quays site.  The message from today's decision is that despite the increased costs as a result of inflation in the construction market, the Government is continuing to support this very ambitious regeneration project for Waterford, not only because it stacks up in a cost-benefit analysis but also because it secures Waterford's place as a centre of growth, which is clear from the CSO statistics that were published recently.  This news will be welcomed across my county.  It will allow Waterford City and County Council to appoint a main contractor for that public works contract and enable that contractor to start on site in the new year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The CEO of Waterford City and County Council, Michael Walsh, and his team have been doing a great deal of work on this.

For Waterford city over the three- to five-year construction phase it is going to create upwards of 1,000 jobs per annum.  It is a very significant regeneration project, one of the biggest in the country.  That green light has been given by Government today.  I want to put on record my thanks to all of the Ministers cross-party, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, who have worked together on this project to bring it forward through the various stages.

It is a national exhibition with a Kildare slant called \"As Life Goes On\".  It is a collaboration between the local history group in Newbridge and a collective of nine artists called SULT Artists.  The work they have produced interprets the change that took place over 100 years ago when the British troops left Kildare.  For those who may not be aware, in the Newbridge area there were 20,000 troops.  Senators can imagine the impact of 20,000 people leaving at the same time, all on the same day, on the local economy and so on.  While there was great joy there was also sadness in terms of business, economy and friendships that had been made.  Nine artists have come together to interpret all of this.

It is in the OPW centre in the Phoenix Park until the end of November.<\/p> <p>On my way back to the House, I listened to the 11 o'clock news where we heard that 13% of those working in Facebook are going to be laid off.

There were more than 65 key events in Ireland, Strasbourg and across Europe.  As part of that we made a call for a fourth summit.  There have only been three in the 73-year history of the Council of Europe.  It is vitally important as we are at a crossroads in Europe, not just because of the war of aggression of Russia against Ukraine but also the new generation of human rights, looking at areas like climate change, artificial intelligence and gender-based violence.

It has been brought to my attention in recent days that female personnel, who have been targeted in this way in our armed forces, on settlement of their claims have been obliged to sign non-disclosure agreements.  This is a particularly toxic phenomenon given the long-standing nature of this very serious issue in our Defence Forces.  We have been aware of these issues now for 22 years.  We have had the independent Government inquiry, the study review group which investigated my research, which confirmed these findings and identified our armed forces as a workplace setting where discrimination, harassment, bullying, sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape are commonplace.  This has been borne out over the years and again last year with the disclosures made by the Women of Honour.<\/p> <p>We have had public statements by very senior officeholders in recent months to the effect that these are historical issues that go back to the past, that the organisation has transformed and that these are no longer workplace phenomena.  Yet at the same time, I learn that female personnel who have been targeted in this way, who have survived it and who brought cases to the courts have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements.  The very same officeholders who claim that these are historical issues are also aware of the signing of these non-disclosure agreements.  I think it is reprehensible.  We know from the RT&Eacute; Radio \"Doc on One\" this week which dealt with sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape at second level, that one of the key tools for dealing with this is openness, transparency and giving people the vocabulary to discuss and describe what has happened to them, to empower them to speak up and end this phenomenon.<\/p> <p>I am asking all Senators for a thorough debate on this pressing issue.  We also need the publication of the interim report of the judge-led inquiry into these issues in the Defence Forces, which was conducted over the last number of years.  It was due to be reported but appears to be delayed.  Some 51% of our population is female.  If our armed forces are not a safe place for female personnel, they are not safe for 51% of our population and therefore cannot purport to defend the State against internal or external threats.  This is a really pressing issue.  We need to move on it and we need in time to honour the demand of the Women of Honour for a full statutory inquiry and for people to be held to account, including the highest officeholders in uniform and the Department of Defence who have known about these issues and have failed to act over the last 22 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#H00500","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I want to say a few words about the Save Moore Street Campaign.  As I am sure everybody is aware, a large development is proposed for a large site in Dublin city centre that is bordered by Moore Street, Henry Street, O'Rahilly Parade and the other laneways in the area.  Most importantly, the site covers the escape route, final battles and surrender of the men and women of the 1916 Easter Rising after they retreated from the GPO.  It is rather unfortunate that Dublin City Council has already granted planning for part of the site for a proposed development up to nine storeys in height.  It beggars belief that this is what the council would see fit to do for such a historically important site.  It is to be welcomed that there has been a large number of appeals submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that are now under consideration.  Certainly from my experience, when I took this matter to the Council of Europe as an MEP, it was in shock that any state would see fit to demolish one of the most important battle sites in its history.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is to be welcomed that on Monday night, Dublin city councillors decided to add further buildings and sections of buildings on Moore Street and the adjoining laneways to the record of protected structures.

People have been working for years to ensure the preservation of Moore Street and its environs and the last extant 1916 battle sites.<\/p><p>We should remember that many of the sites and buildings associated with the 1916 Rising have already been lost to Dublin.  Of 32 sites in the city, 19 have already been completely demolished.  There is still time to save Moore Street from the developer's wrecking ball, however.  The campaign to save Moore Street will now continue in the hope that an historic cultural quarter dedicated to the memory of the men and women of 1916 can be created rather than some nine-storey mega-development.  Such a memorial would be fitting while at the same time provide an attraction, not just for tourists visiting the country but also for citizens of Ireland and schoolchildren, similar to Kilmainham Gaol, which is one of our most popular tourist sites.  I congratulate Dublin city councillors on their unanimous decision on Monday evening.  It is a very hopeful sign.  It has certainly given hope that we will not lose the opportunity to save Moore Street and one of the most significant historic sites on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#H00600","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy Leader for proposing the Order of Business.  I wish to raise the issue of apartment defects and a redress scheme.  In particular, I wish to raise the issue of Metropolitan Apartments in Dublin 8.  There is a commitment that a redress scheme will be available.  We had hoped to see some movement within the budget last year.  Unfortunately, there has not been movement.  The report of the construction defects working group has been sitting on the Minister's desk since July at this stage.<\/p><p>There is a real worry among apartment owners who are affected that the retrospective element of the scheme will not apply.  In particular, there is anecdotal evidence.  Residents tell me that where there are levies, people are afraid of spending the money now to make sure their apartments or buildings are fire safe because they are concerned that the retrospective element of the scheme will not be included in it.  I would like the Minister to commit that there will be a retrospective element to the scheme for people who have spent money to date.<\/p><p>The fire officer has ordered the car park at Metropolitan Apartments in Kilmainham to be closed.  It will potentially be closed until mid-2023, if not beyond.  I am trying to work with Dublin City Council at the moment to get people permits for on-street parking.  I have been coming up against bureaucracy from one State agency to another and the residents are caught in between.  This is being caused by a lack of a commitment to a retrospective scheme.  People cannot pay money to be able to make their car park fire safe until they know they will be able to apply for a scheme.  There is already a commitment that the Government will have a redress scheme in place for mica.  We need a commitment that people who are spending money at the moment, or else living in unsafe conditions, are able to apply retrospectively.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of Tathony House, which is a 35-person apartment block in Dublin 8.  The more than 100 residents have been served an eviction notice to the effect that all 35 of the apartments are going to be sold.  The owner, who has a very substantial rent roll, is saying that the Tyrrelstown amendment does not apply to him because it will cause him undue hardship.  This is a perfect situation where we see the right to sell affecting more than 100 people in 35 apartments.  They could or should be sold with the tenants <i>in situ<\/i>, either to a local authority or housing association or even on the private market.  However, we should not have a situation where 100 people are being turfed out on the street because of undue hardship to somebody who is sitting on a rent roll of &euro;700,000 per year.  The tenants are protected now while the eviction ban is in place.  Come the summer, however, those 100 residents in 35 apartments will not be protected.  The idea that some private landlord can make a decision that affects so many people in the middle of a housing crisis is an absolute disgrace.  I ask the Government to step in to try to come up with a solution for existing residents, but also to ensure that this is not allowed to happen.  A figure of 35 apartments is a substantial number, particularly when we have more than 11,000 people, including 3,000 children, living in homelessness.  This is a big contributing factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#J00300","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#J00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I wish to bring up once again the revolution in Iran and the ongoing well-publicised protests led by the women of Iran.

It is hard to believe and almost beggars belief that the understanding that was made, which was that the Shannon Heritage group would switch from Shannon Group to Clare County Council, was not followed through on in the budget.  These are key tourism sites, namely, Bunratty Castle, Craggaunowen Castle, Knappogue Castle and Dunguaire Castle.  They are a package of sites that bring tourists in huge numbers to the mid-west to Limerick and Clare.  The sites are in trouble because they have not had investment for years.  What is puzzling is the fact that an interdepartmental group was set up in June of this year to effectively arrange for the transfer of the sites to Clare County Council.  The workers were expecting it, as was their union, SIPTU.  They waged a powerful campaign over the last couple of years, in which I was proud to stand with them, to see that this was done.<\/p> <p>As the Deputy Leader will know, there are six Deputies and Senators on the Government side in County Clare alone and yet, somehow, the Government dropped the ball in the budget.  Somehow, the small sum of &euro;5 million that was required, which I am sure the Deputy Leader will agree is a literal drop in the ocean in terms of the budget, did not happen.  The problem is that the interdepartmental group has so many components to it that there does not seem to be anyone to actually make the decision to get this transfer done and get the funding.  It cannot happen without that funding.  We need to see our key tourism sites properly resourced and financed.  The workers have been incredibly let down.  They face being let go again in January.

If it slips beyond Christmas, you have to wonder what the future is for these key sites in our tourism package in the mid-west.

I formally welcome the announcement this week by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, of the roll-out of &euro;450,000 of funding for Traveller apprenticeships.  That is a positive move which I want to acknowledge and which is important.  It is not a lot of money but it is a movement in the right direction.  Education and training are important, particularly for the Traveller community in terms of practical apprenticeships that are tailored for their specific needs.  We know it is sometimes difficult for the Traveller community in particular, not necessarily for reasons of their making, to remain in education and training.  What I like about the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Harris, yesterday is that he has put in place funding for a national apprenticeship outreach officer, which will maintain ongoing contact and support with the people who sign up for the apprenticeship scheme.  That is another positive initiative by the Minister.  I acknowledge that.  It is important and the Minister is doing amazing work in education and training.  He has spoken many times in this House about how he sees education in the broader sense in terms of supports in education.  I acknowledge that and at some point we might have more detailed discussion on that scheme.<\/p> <p>I wish the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, well.

They are seeking the establishment of a subregional area under the new LEADER programme.  For the last LEADER programme the islands were part of their designated counties, the Mayo islands with the Mayo groups and the Galway islands in their forum.  They are united in the view that this change should take place and that they should be part of a united islands programme under this round of LEADER from next January.  There is still time for that to happen, although only a small amount of time.  I am calling for a debate with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, on islands, islands policy, the next LEADER programme and how islands are treated in that.  It is something island communities want, they believe it will make a strong and positive difference, and there is cross-party support for it.  The relationships between islands and their local authorities leave a lot to be desired in some cases, although some counties are better than others.  This is a small change that could make a big difference in how this scheme is operated and funded for island communities.  There are such similarities between the islands, and they have much more in common in many cases than they have with their associated mainland counties.

In the constituency where I live, Dublin Central, the National Transport Authority is rolling out a number of projects, one of them being the MetroLink, for which it has applied for planning permission, along with BusConnects.

Running two of them at one time in one area results in an enormous burden.  Submissions will cost each resident &euro;100, during a cost-of-living crisis, and making such a submission in the run-up in the Christmas is an enormous burden.

I concur with the Senator&rsquo;s remarks about the importance of balanced regional development to see other cities and regions get significant investment.  He mentioned that there will be a new bridge over the River Suir, a relocation of Plunkett Station and additional access points.

The Senator spoke also about Tyrrelstown, the 35 apartments that are to be sold by one landlord and the 100-plus residents who will be left without anywhere to live when that happens.  She acknowledged the benefit of the eviction ban that will be in place until early next year but argued there will be a problem after the lifting of that ban.  She might engage directly with me, the Minister or the Leader's office to deal with that view.  I do not have details on the landlord in question and what is happening, but I concur with the Senator&rsquo;s remarks that a significant number of people will be left with nowhere to go and it seems a bit of a stretch to say the landlord will be greatly disadvantaged on that front, so she might engage directly with me on that.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about the ongoing protests in Iran, pointing out that we are on day 55.

The letter was worded in a tone that I did not consider appropriate to come from an embassy or ambassador in this country to an Oireachtas Member, and I did not take kindly to it.  I believe other Senators may have received a similar letter.  I am not sure whether it was limited to group spokespersons or to those who had engaged in the debate.  Let us be clear: as a House, we are perfectly entitled to debate issues of that nature.  I stand fully over the remarks of all Senators and the wording of that motion, which was modelled on a similar motion at European Council level.  We will not be silenced or intimidated, in any shape or form, into not having our voices heard and we will continue to debate, discuss and highlight the ongoing human rights abuses and atrocities that are taking place in Iran.  I reiterate our solidarity with the men, women and children of Iran, who are going through an horrific time, and in particular the women of Iran, who are just trying to fight for basic freedoms we all enjoy without even a thought in this country.

Safe to Create is a dignity at work programme.  It is the culmination of our work to date on dignity at work, led by programmes such as Speak Up and Call it Out, Speak Up: A Call for Change, and Minding Creative Minds.  I emphasise that this is our work to date because although we are at the cutting edge of action in this area, we are really only getting started.  The aim of the Safe to Create programme is to transform culture and practices in the arts, culture and creative sector through raising awareness and providing training, information, voluntary compliance and certification in order that we can provide safer working conditions for artists and arts workers as well as providing key support for victims and survivors in the areas of reporting, counselling and legal advice.<\/p> <p>My Department works in partnership with the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Minding Creative Minds to deliver the Safe to Create programme.  I provide annual funding to the Irish Theatre Institute and to Minding Creative Minds to deliver their services to the creative sector.  The Safe to Create platform provides an effective, user-friendly, online dignity at work toolkit for organisations and individuals in the creative sector, including \"know your rights\" information for artists and arts workers; free counselling, legal assistance and a 24-7 helpline for artists and arts workers; resources for organisations including legislation, codes, policies and sample HR procedures and templates; a code of behaviour and dignity at work trust statement; Sign the Code, which is an online register for organisations and individuals to formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to implement it; and training to address dignity at work issues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Safe to Create is available to all individuals and organisations in the Irish arts and creative sector.  I encourage Senators to explore the website, <i>www.safetocreate.ie<\/i>, and view the range of information, training and resources.  The website, like the programme itself, is evolving as additional information, services and resources are added.<br\/><br\/>The Safe to Create programme emerged from the Irish Theatre Institute&rsquo;s Speak Up initiative.  In 2021, I engaged the Irish Theatre Institute to carry out an anonymous survey which attracted over 1,300 respondents.  A year ago, the findings of the survey were published under the title Speak Up: A Call for Change, along with a set of recommendations.  The report&rsquo;s stark findings confirmed that there was a culture of harmful workplace behaviour throughout the Irish arts sector and a worrying lack of supports to tackle this issue.  When I launched the Speak Up: A Call for Change report last year, I assured all of the respondents to the survey that their voices had been heard.  The Safe to Create programme is built on and informed by the findings and recommendations in the Speak Up report, and particularly on the areas where artists and arts workers said they needed change and support.<br\/><br\/>With the Safe to Create programme, we in the arts are leading the way in improving and transforming damaging norms for the benefit of all in the creative sector.  Together we can ensure creative spaces are safe and that those working in the sector are treated with dignity and respect.  I am pleased to have secured additional funding of up to &euro;500,000 in budget 2023 for the Safe to Create programme.  The planned supports will include the resource-rich website featuring practical information, guidance, toolkits and templates for artists, arts workers and organisations regarding dignity at work rights and responsibilities and the well-being and support service provided by Minding Creative Minds for victims of harmful behaviours, including one-on-one counselling, access to legal advice and a 24-hour trauma helpline.  The supports also include the training programme that has been developed specifically for the arts and creative sectors on dignity at work issues.  It includes the topics of tackling bullying and harassment, and addressing unconscious bias.  The training programme also includes bystander training and intimacy training that has been created in partnership with Screen Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The code of behaviour that organisations are asked to adopt is an important element of this programme.  It has been developed to help enable arts and creative organisations to create workplaces free from bullying, harassment and intimidation of any kind and to reassure artists and arts workers that their employers are publicly adopting the code.  The code is on the Safe to Create website, along with a register that organisations and individuals can formally sign.  The aim is to embed this industry-wide code of behaviour in the sector to do the following: proactively encourage a zero-tolerance attitude to all of the negative behaviours; commit to investigate complaints in a timely fashion; raise awareness of what constitutes damaging behaviour; and encourage all workers to undertake training.  There are workshop roadshows called &quot;Code on the Road&quot; currently happening throughout the country to provide information for individuals and support for organisations to utilise and implement the Safe to Create supports and code of behaviour.  The first Code on the Road took place in Cork last week.<br\/><br\/>Report to Support is an anonymous reporting system designed to provide a facility for those working in the arts and creative sectors to report incidents of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment without the need to identify themselves or disclose sensitive and personal details.  Information collected via the Report to Support pilot will be aggregated twice annually and will be used to inform the development and delivery of additional dignity at work supports such as training, policies, legal supports and counselling.  This information will also inform the new research planned for 2023 and beyond.  The Safe to Create website has information on steps individuals can take to make a formal or informal complaint on individual experiences.<br\/><br\/>A research programme of further study will examine the prevalence and impact of harmful behaviours in Ireland&rsquo;s arts sector and measure the impact of the Safe to Create programme.  The lead researcher is currently undergoing an analysis of methodologies to use that would be more inclusive of the intersectionality of ethnicity, disability, sexuality and how it influences harm within and across Ireland&rsquo;s arts sector.<br\/><br\/>Monitoring and compliance will be led by funding bodies, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, and by my Department.  Organisations found not to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams.  The Arts Council is introducing a condition that all funded organisations must adopt and implement the Safe to Create code of behaviour and undertake relevant online Safe to Create training.  Screen Ireland similarly requires full legal compliance with all health and safety in the workplace and employment legislation.  In addition, it requires funding recipients to maintain dignity at work policies that include appropriate action and grievance procedures to address employee complaints.<br\/><br\/>In the coming months, my Department and the Irish Theatre Institute will be working in partnership to implement and promote these supports, to monitor the impact of measures taken and to collaborate with appropriate agencies to build effective monitoring, accountability and oversight mechanisms for harmful behaviour in the workplace in the arts sector in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>Since becoming Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I have recognised the importance of well-being for the creative sector.  Minding Creative Minds is a free 24-7 mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and includes access to advice, counselling, legal advice, assistance, financial and budgeting advice, career guidance and life coaching and mediation.  Minding Creative Minds has recently enhanced its services to include specialist trauma and abuse counselling care and support for victims of serious trauma and sexual abuse, in association with Spectrum Life.  With additional funding provided by my Department, Minding Creative Minds also plans to provide access to new therapies in 2023 in addition to the mental health and ancillary supports it already offers.  It also plans to develop and roll out a specific app for the creative sector that will readily enable users of the 24-7 well-being service to contact or chat with a qualified counsellor or psychotherapist.  In addition, it aims to further expand its mentoring programme which has proved very successful, having provided 500 career mentoring hours to date.<br\/><br\/>The Safe to Create programme is a step on the road to transforming workplace culture and practices and to providing safe and respectful working conditions for those working in the arts.  However, we know that harmful behaviours are not confined to the arts sector.  In order to enact real change, cross-governmental co-operation is required.  That is why my Department has been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice.<br\/><br\/>The third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was launched on 28 June by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  The strategy incorporates the implementation of the Safe to Create programme, which is listed in the implementation plan.  This third national strategy will cost &euro;363 million and is built on the four pillars of the Istanbul Convention framework.  The accompanying implementation plan contains 144 detailed actions for implementation this year and next year.  This implementation will be ensured by strong oversight and co-ordination at central government level.  A key element of delivering on the goal of the strategy is the establishment of a statutory domestic, sexual and gender-based violence agency under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  This agency, to be set up in law, will be tasked with co-ordinating all Government actions set out in this third national strategy.<br\/><br\/>As Minister, I ask all parties in the arts, culture and creative sectors to engage with Safe to Create.  Organisations sign the code and demonstrate the sector-wide desire to make our workplaces safer.  I encourage everyone working in the sector at every level, including employees, the self-employed and those on boards, to undertake, and get certified as having completed, three free online training courses, specifically those on addressing unconscious bias, tackling bullying and harassment at work, and bystander training.<br\/><br\/>Before I conclude, I will acknowledge the efforts of the stakeholders involved who worked closely with my Department to make the Safe to Create programme happen, namely, the Irish Theatre Institute, Minding Creative Minds, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland.  There was also constructive engagement from FairPl&eacute;.  Also of note is the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, entitled A Safe and Respectful Working Environment in the Arts.  It is closely aligned with the Irish Theatre Institute's Speak Up report and most of its 11 recommendations are being, or will be, addressed by the Safe to Create programme.  I sincerely thank the committee for its support and engagement on this important issue.<br\/><br\/>I particularly thank the individuals who responded to the Speak Up survey.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Their courage reminds me of the Jane Austen quote:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.

From the outset, as Minister responsible for the arts, I wanted to send out a clear message that dignity in the workplace is the right of every artist and arts worker.  While we know that these issues are not confined to the arts sector, through the Safe to Create programme we are working hard to change damaging behaviours.  During this process I have heard first-hand that people have been suffering great trauma and harm.  Inaction is inexcusable and I hope that this extensive programme of supports will encourage other sectors to follow suit. <br\/><br\/>As the old Irish proverb goes, an&aacute;il na beatha an t-athr&uacute;, that is, change is the breath of life.

Safe to Create is a pivotal and much needed dignity at work programme for people in the arts sector which has been strongly promoted by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  Its goal is to impact change and the culture and practices of the arts sector in Ireland to provide safer working conditions for artists and arts workers.  An article published last year detailed how approximately 10% of employees reported having been bullied or harassed in the workplace and that workplace bullying costs Ireland &euro;239 million annually through lost productivity, not to mention the anguish and mental torture it can cause.  The same study showed that workplace bullying can cause an increased chance of accidents occurring and increased consumption of alcohol, as well as putting a strain on personal relationships.  A report launched by the Minister last year entitled, Speak Up: A Call for Change, found that 70% of people in the arts sector have experienced harmful workplace behaviours.  It also found that freelance arts workers were more likely to face this than others and that people working in the dance sector were the most likely to experience harassment and bullying.  It is therefore encouraging that the Minister has launched this initiative.<\/p> <p>There has been wide consultation on the issue and it is brilliant to see the number of arts organisations that have already welcomed it.  In particular the anonymous reporting system for artists will bring people comfort and empower them to report instances of bullying and harassment without fear.  This support, as well as the well-being supports, access to legal advice, and a 24-hour trauma helpline will be a relief to people employed in the arts where these is often an unbalanced power dynamic.  <\/p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sports and Media released a thorough report following publication of the Speak Up report and it is welcome that the Minister has acted on many of the recommendations within that report.  I encourage all involved in the arts sector to look at the website and the code of behaviour, if they have not done so already, so they know what is expected of them and others they work with.  I would also urge those who run arts organisations to sign up formally to the code of behaviour that is online to publicly declare their commitment to implementing it.  This sends a strong signal to those working for and with them that bullying, harassment and intimidation are not tolerated in their organisation.  <\/p> <p>One aspect I particularly welcome in this initiative is the commitment to further research in this area.  In Ireland, we sometimes fall into the trap of following policy-based evidence rather than evidence-based policy.  This research, along with the Speak Up report and submissions to the Oireachtas joint committee will provide valuable information on the experience of those in the arts sector.  We cannot solve a problem without knowing its full extent.  The research will be carried out by the same team as the Speak Up: A Call for Change report team and will look into the intersectionalities of ethnicity, disability, and sexuality and their influences of harm within and across Ireland's arts sector.  I look forward to the Minister continuing to engage further with the sector on those issues and to delivering real change.  To conclude, as the Minister referred to in her opening remarks, the Safe to Create programme responds to a series of recommendations identified in the Speak Up report and is coordinated by the Irish Theatre Institute in partnership with the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Minding Creative Minds.  In my final conclusion I would like to acknowledge on the record of this House and convey huge thanks to every individual who responded to the initial Speak Up survey or who have ever spoken about harm they faced at work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#Q00300","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming today.  I want to make a brief appeal to her.  I have received a number of representations from disabled artists and like every other artist in the country, they want to have a meaningful and self-supporting role in society and to contribute meaningfully to Irish cultural life and Irish art.  However they face steep challenges.  Without going into too much detail, Ireland, sadly, is a difficult place in which to have a disability.  One in five persons with disabilities in Ireland experience consistent poverty and 27% of homeless people are disabled citizens, even though disabled citizens only consist of around 13% of the population.  They are disproportionately impacted by homelessness, poverty, social isolation, sub-optimal medical outcomes and life limiting consequences not just because of their disability but because they are disabled in Ireland.  We are outliers.  I am sorry to say this but Ireland is the worst country in Europe to have a disability on so many different measures.<\/p> <p>I know from personal experience, that is, from my own lived experience as a parent and carer to my son Eoghan, who has a disability, the huge challenges that just getting up in the morning, being able to get dressed, to toilet and to get out the front door with your clothes on is quite an achievement.  Again, as outliers we are the only state in the European Union that does not have the legal obligation for the State or its agents to provide carer hours or assistant hours.  We are also the only state in the European Union where there is no legal obligation on the State to provide therapies and supports.  Recently there has been a legal requirement for an assessment of need but there is no legal requirement in Ireland for the State to then act on that assessment of need and provide the supports.  Disabled citizens in Ireland are at a huge disadvantage and we need to recognise that disadvantage and that difference.<\/p> <p>When it comes to supports for disabled artists I have received a number of representations including, for instance, from Ms Emilie Conway of the Disabled Artists and Disabled Academics, DADA, which is campaigning for cultural and social inclusion.  That group makes the point that as disabled artists, if they get an award from the Arts Council to help to develop their artistic contribution, they can have their blind pension or their disability allowance abated.  Ms Conway has made a number of representations to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, as I have.  The reply I get from the Minister and her Department is that they treat everybody the same and that is where the equality lies; that it would be unfair to give an extra allowance to an person or an artist with a disability as opposed to a so-called able-bodied person who is receiving a social welfare payment.  The suggestion is it would be unfair to give the disabled person the extra bit of support.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tom Clonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I appeal to the Minister to talk to her ministerial colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and to tell her that equality is not about treating people the same; it is about recognising the difference and the extra challenges that disabled persons face in Ireland.  It is to recognise that difference but scaffold it and provide support.  The State will not go bankrupt if we give disabled persons that little bit of extra assistance.  One is not going to get hundreds of thousands of people suddenly demanding this extra resource.  It is a very simple and modest request that the Government supports disabled artists.<\/p><p>Again, I know from my own lived experience as a family that isolation is a terrible outcome from having a disability in Ireland.  As an artist, one wants to participate in and contribute to the cultural life of the nation.  We have a very strong tradition in Ireland because there has been a disproportionate contribution made to the arts by disabled artists such as James Joyce and other artists.  In fact, there are too many to mention whose disability or difference has brought a unique perspective or unique creative dynamic to the artistic space and benefits everybody.<\/p><p>We have had a similar conversation about supports being given to disabled entrepreneurs and the same concerns arose.  I mean that disabled entrepreneurs cannot avail of personal assistant hours to help them in the workplace.  Again, the response that we got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is that all entrepreneurs are treated the same.  Like entrepreneurs and artists, disabled entrepreneurs and disabled artists make the same appeal that they cannot be treated the same, they must be treated differently and must be given the extra supports and help they need.<\/p><p>Since I came into this House in March of this year, I have not met one Deputy or Senator who does not want to help disabled citizens but there is a lacuna here.  I appeal to the Minister present, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the officials in their respective Departments to put their heads together and sort out this anomaly and allow disabled artists to avail of extra supports.  In certain cases, such support might bring disabled artists over the income threshold of &euro;140 a week, but so what?  Consider the challenges that disabled persons face to even get out the door in the morning with their clothes on.  Moreover, as Ireland has signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we are supposed to proof all of our legislation and policies in the spirit of that convention.  I know that the Minister is a person of absolute good faith and, therefore, I ask her to do whatever she can to assist us in that matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#Q00500","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Clonan, on the importance of involving artists with disabilities.  He has made his points very well.  I know from talking to artists with a disability that they are concerns that are reflected within the sector.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister because she personally is very invested in this matter.  When she appeared before our Oireachtas committee, she provided real leadership on this issue.  She has put her money where her mouth is and taken on board the recommendations made by our committee, and the Irish Theatre Institute.  She has provided real leadership within this sector.<\/p> <p>I thank everyone on the committee who did the work.  In particular, I single out my colleague, Senator Warfield, for playing a leading role within the committee specifically around this issue.  We worked in a very collegial way on something we think is extremely important.  I was quite influenced by the testimony of many of those who came forward, and some with great bravery, to talk about their own personal experience.  Oireachtas committees often deal with legislation and policies, and we debate where funding should go and so on.  However, it is difficult for people to share their personal experiences and that informed our report and, indeed, influenced the approach taken by the Minister. <\/p> <p>The arts, creative and cultural sectors should be fun, enjoyable and engaging places in which to work.  Anybody who gets involved should always feel safe in such environments.  In the majority of cases most people do feel safe but, unfortunately, we have had quite a number of cases where people do not feel safe.  As Senator Martin has said, in many cases this is because of the power dynamic.  For artists, particularly emerging artists, one of the challenges they face, and often when they seek work and support, is that they must deal with individuals who are in much more powerful positions and they really often depend on those individuals to give them a break.  I think what the Minister has done by creating the Safe to Create programme is to provide a safe space, ensure there is a balance and, most importantly, that everybody within the sector understands their obligations.<\/p> <p>In many ways, one often hopes that there is never a need for dignity at work code.  In an ideal world there would not be a need because we would know how to behave and interact, plus somebody who is in a position of power or responsibility would act as a mentor and encourage the young and emerging artists, and would not abuse his or her position but, unfortunately, we need the code.  I commend the Minister on establishing the code.  A lot of thanks are due to her, her officials and all of the stakeholders within the sector for the code but we also need to remember those in the Irish Theatre Institute and others who were brave enough to speak out in the first instance.  We need to roll out the programme.  There must be implications for organisations that do not take the code seriously.  We also need to use State funding in a responsible way and if organisations do not take the code seriously then we need to withhold State funding.<\/p> <p>l, again, commend the Minister and her officials on the work that they have done on the code.  I am sure that she will find any support she needs in a cross-party way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#R00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Senator Kyne is next.

He highlighted the fact that the recommendations in the report are to be initiated as part of this programme.  The committee has heard very powerful testimony and he asked me to say that the Minister has taken on board the concerns that were raised at the committee meeting.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about the arts sector being a fun place and of course it is, certainly outwardly, but like any organisation, arts organisations can be stressful places due to deadlines to meet and various pressures.  In some cases, if one is doing an outdoor event, one must worry about the weather, which is obviously an issue in this country.  One has funding issues.  One worries about ticket sales and attendance rates.  These are pressures experienced by arts organisations but that is no excuse for any impact on workers in the form of bullying, harassment and of course sexual harassment.<\/p> <p>A report has been published and the plans that the Minister has initiated are very welcome.  They provide a platform that highlights the responsibilities of organisations.  I have looked at the Safe to Create website and found it very informative, which I am sure it will be both for artists and organisations in terms of identifying what they need to do.  I have noted that organisations are asked to produce reports in terms of the Dignity at Work programme.  I see that the Minister has stated that if organisations do not adhere to the code, there can be an impact on future funding, which is important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I imagine all organisations will but, as something new, it would be the responsibility of the board and the organisation to ensure a dignity at work policy is compiled.<\/p><p>I welcome the initiative the Minister took with the anonymous survey.  There was a high number of respondents, more than 1,300, and a set of recommendations.  That led to the report and to the work that is ongoing.  That has shown leadership.  It is important the recommendations are taken on board on the strengthening of reporting, the consequences, as the Minister outlined, for non-compliance, and building capacity and investing further in the area.<\/p><p>I note the workshop roadshows taking place.  There is one in Galway now, possibly ending in the next few minutes, in the Harbour Hotel.  I hope that was well attended as part of the roll-out throughout the country.  Is it envisaged there would be a deadline with these roadshows?  For how long will they be taking place or are they ongoing?  Will they be repeated?  Will the dignity policies require to be updated?  I know there will be monitoring and compliance, but what feedback will come to the Minister?  Will it go to the Minister, or where will it go, about all the organisations?<\/p><p>The website is informative and lists a number of descriptions and areas relating to bullying, harassment and sexual harassment.  Much of it, one could argue, is obvious, but we saw across the water yesterday a high-profile resignation from Cabinet because of text messages.  It is important people know what form bullying and harassment can take.  Some people may not be aware, though they should be.  Having it written down in black and white so that everyone knows their responsibilities is very advantageous in terms of providing safeguards and safe workplaces for workers.  We have often talked about our own roles in dignity at work policies.  I commend the Minister on the initiatives taken to ensure arts organisations are complying and providing safe workspaces.  They should be joyful places to work but are stressful as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#R00400","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome.  It is obvious from her presentation that she has invested much work in this.  Well done on securing &euro;500,000 in the budget.  I like proposals like this because it is not just a strategy.  The Minister is backing it up with the mechanics of how it will work in a 360&deg; approach.  I wish all of our strategies were as clear-cut as to how we will address cultural changes and backing that up with the code and regulations around it, the expectations and the recognition that there is more work to do.<\/p> <p>It is significant in the year we introduce the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence that we have introduced this Safe to Create programme to a specific sector.  Dignity and respect should be a given in any workplace for everybody but, unfortunately, that is not how it works.  In certain professions, the more competitive it is, the more it is perceived you are lucky to have made it or to be trying to, and the more difficult it is means sometimes people think certain behaviours are acceptable when they are absolutely not.  Bad behaviour seems sometimes more prevalent in areas that are more competitive.  There should be no tolerance of that.  It is recognised in the report and in what the Minister said today that women can be vulnerable, as can minorities.  We see that across the board.  In the arts sector, the Minister has recognised that today.<\/p> <p>I am here to try to represent Senator Carrigy and all the work done in the committee to support the progress of the report.  I will reflect on that 360&deg; view, the education and training, the code of behaviour and the research required for minorities.  It is great that Minding Creative Minds is involved, offering mental health support, and that there is a reporting system.  The Arts Council and Screen Ireland are putting in a condition that people must adopt the Safe to Create code of practice and undertake the online Safe to Create training.  My colleague Senator Kyne said organisations risk disallowing themselves from future funding if they do not abide by the code and standards, and I completely concur with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#S00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for enabling this debate and these contributions.  It is always important and welcome when feminism finds its way into our public policy.  I thank all the witnesses who appeared before the Joint\u00a0Committee\u00a0on Tourism, Culture,\u00a0Arts, Sport and Media.  Harmful behaviours, including bullying, humiliation, harassment, sexual harassment, assault and sexual assault, are not the preserve of the arts but constitute a societal issue.  However, the work and activism of women in traditional and folk music through FairPl&eacute; and MiseFosta, including &Uacute;na Monaghan and Karan Casey, have been a huge inspiration to me.  They should be commended on and thanked for it.  They put their careers on hold and distracted from their careers and from the work of making art and music in order to support fellow women in the arts and culture who needed somewhere to go to tell their story.  In many ways, FairPl&eacute; and MiseFosta women became the go-to place for people to share their stories.  That is a huge burden to place on individuals who should be making music and contributing to the cultural life of our country.<\/p> <p>The Minister's support, alongside that of the Arts Council, has enabled the Irish Theatre Institute to develop this report, Speak Up: A Call for Change, which is a beautiful document.  It highlights the importance of research, because through the austerity years, we had an absence of research into the arts.  Money had to get out as quickly as possible directly to artists to make work.  Research was probably forgotten for many years.  I commend the Minister on embracing the issue, putting money behind it and enabling that research.  The work of Jane Daly, Siobh&aacute;n Bourke and the Irish Theatre Institute must be commended.  That showed the time for action was now.<\/p> <p>As I have said before, I hope by engaging with the issue the Oireachtas committee has contributed to recommendation 1 of the call for change report.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I have said before, men, the male colleagues of these musicians and artists, need to come to the table.  As we know, these supports are entirely built on and informed by the findings and recommendations in the Speak Up report.  I again commend Jane Daly and Siobh&aacute;n Bourke but also the 13,000 people, primarily women, who came forward to tell their stories.  Their courage in speaking out will lead to a safer and more respectful working environment for all.  Without their brave and selfless decision to speak up, this would not have been possible and we owe them the greatest debt.  I also extend my thanks again to the Irish Theatre Institute.  This comprehensive and ground-breaking analysis of the experience of bulling and sexual harassment for those working in Ireland's arts sector has provided the framework and recommendations upon which these supports are based.  I am confident this report and subsequent reports will not only result in a cultural shift in attitudes and behaviour in Ireland but also provide a framework for the arts sectors in many other jurisdictions around the world.<br\/><br\/>I also acknowledge and thank the Minister for the commitment she has shown in acting swiftly on these recommendations.  She has proven she is up for this and I commend her on it.  Far too often, reports are left to sit and gather dust but the Minister's strong and committed leadership in this regard sends a clear message that negative behaviours will no longer be tolerated.  Having visited the website <i>safetocreate.ie<\/i>, I am delighted to see the range of easily accessible and practical information that is already available to both individuals and organisations seeking guidance and support.  I am particularly pleased to see the range of online training programmes developed specifically for the creative sector and am further heartened to see the Code on the Road workshops have already begun; with one taking place in Cork last week and a further three scheduled in Galway, Dublin and Sligo this month.  Proactively reaching out to individuals is a vital step to achieving widespread cultural reform and I hope such workshops will soon be replicated across the country.  <br\/><br\/>I am also encouraged by the strength and support of these measures within the industry.  As we know, cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary leadership is fundamental to the development of a zero-tolerance approach across the sector.  I therefore thank the figures for their public support to date and encourage them and others to continue to speak publically about the need for immediate cultural change in their respective sectors.  I once again thank all those who have been involved and hope the Minister will continue to show her sincere commitment to the elimination of such harmful behaviours in the arts by expediting the provision of support services for victims of such behaviour including one-on-one counselling, access to legal advice, and a 24 hour trauma helpline.  I express my sincere hope that this will not be the end of such work but instead a building block upon which further research into the prevalence and impact of harmful behaviours in Ireland's arts sector will be built.  I know that is something about which the Minister is adamant.  <br\/><br\/>The only question I have is about monitoring and compliance.  The Minister has spoken about this being led by bodies such as the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, as well as by her Department and that there will be range of measures around conditionality of funding.  Will the same compliance and conditionality be attached to funding the Department's funding partners, that is, the big organisations that receive funding directly from the Department?  Can we expect, as far as possible, a standardised process of conditionality around funding between the Department's funding partners, and between the Arts Council and Screen Ireland?  <br\/><br\/>I again thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I am just out of time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#S00300","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will take the opportunity to welcome our guests to the Seanad this afternoon.

I am thankful I never experienced abusive treatment during my own music career.  I was surrounded by many caring and protective people, including members of my family.  I felt very safe but it is sad to say I was probably one of the lucky ones.  It is sad to think that way; even though I was safe, I was just one of the lucky ones.  It is heartbreaking to hear about young creative people who have been deprived of their ability to be creative because of this awful abuse and cruelty.  Everyone deserves the right to creative expression and a dignified and safe workplace; these rights are absolutely non-negotiable.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and her officials highly on the launch of the Safe to Create programme.  She is deeply committed to the welfare of artists and has fought hard for us within the Government.  I thank her personally for that.  I am certain many of the supports made available under this programme, particularly the helpline, access to legal advice and the anonymous reporting system, will really make a difference to people who are struggling.  It is good and really powerful to see the Government commit to action in this area but more needs to be done.  I can safely say there is no better woman for the job than the Minister.  <\/p> <p>A few weeks ago, I attended the launch of the new report of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, entitled A Safe and Respectful Working Environment in the Arts.  It is a powerful document and I commend my colleague, Senator Warfield, and everyone who worked on it.  The report is enriched by the powerful testimony of witnesses representing organisations such as Safe Arts of Ireland, Fair Pl&eacute; and the Irish Theatre Institute among many others and it contains a number of tangible, practical recommendations to guide the Government as it takes further steps to deal with these issues.  One of the key recommendations of the report is conditioning public arts funding on adherence to anti-harassment and workplace dignity protocols designed to protect artists and creatives from abuse and to ensure people alleging mistreatment are treated with care and respect.  This is something the Government can do to ensure the safety of arts workers.  Public funding for the arts is vital but it can be used as an effective means of making change in fields and institutions that can be resistant to change. <\/p> <p>A common feature of many of the stories we have heard about abuse and mistreatment in the arts sector is the role that people&rsquo;s precarious employment relationships and finances have played in preventing them from coming forward or from leaving abusive situations.  We need to combat the racist, sexist and homophobic ideology contributing to abuse and harassment, but we also need to combat the inequality and precarity underpinning it.  People in desperate positions struggle to make their voices heard.  People working in the arts fear they will be blacklisted if they speak out and an already uncertain career will be rendered totally unviable.  If we want to empower people to stand up and resist mistreatment, one way this could be done is by expanding the basic income for artists pilot scheme; ensuring the effective and confidential resolution of complaints; combating predatory precarious work in the sector; and ensuring victims of workplace bullying or sexual harassment have access to justice.  Access to justice is a constitutional right and we all know that but has it been adequately vindicated in this area?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Workplace bullying and sexual harassment cases are largely dealt with in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Aggrieved workers can take cases without the need for legal representation, as there is no provision in our civil legal aid regime for representation at the WRC.  This has been spun as increasing the accessibility of justice, but it is not.  The institutions and the firms these workers are seeking justice from come to the WRC with a legal team in tow.  The equality of arms that has been central to our common law understanding of justice is totally lost.  A review of the civil legal aid regime is ongoing.  This is a major issue that needs to be addressed if we want to tackle bullying, harassment and abuse in the workplace across all sectors.  That is just by the way.<\/p><p>I am very glad to see the first steps that are being taken in this area.  It speaks volumes about the passion and determination of the activists but also the Minister's own passion and determination, which I warmly welcome.  The activists got the ball rolling and the Minister has shown a willingness to listen and to act.  We now need to harness this momentum to truly protect artists, creatives and all workers.  I again thank the Minister and her officials for the great work they have done.  I know they have done phenomenal work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#T00500","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#U00200","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to speak about this informative programme today.  I compliment her and her officials in the Department on all the work they have done in regard to it to date.<\/p> <p>No matter what walk of life we are in, respect and dignity in the workplace are something we all aspire to, but it is not always a given in every workplace.  I welcome the creation of the website, which is informative, not only for individuals but for groups in terms of mentoring and the mental health aspect.  There is legal advice and so much other information on the website that is good and is appreciated by artists.  The life of an artist can be very lonely.  Some artists work in isolation, while others work in groups or are engaged in the performing arts or the digital arts.  There are many variations but the Minister has covered a lot of areas in the information that has provided initially on the website.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the fact that roadshows are part of the programme.  I note there will be two in the west and one in Dublin.  It would have been nice to see one in the mid-west or the south as well.  Perhaps the Minister could consider one of those areas for the next roadshow because there are a lot of artists' communities in the Munster region.<\/p> <p>When the Minister spoke earlier, she referred to further research that will be carried out to ensure more inclusivity and to cover ethnicity, disability and sexuality.  Further research is being conducted and a report will be forthcoming.  When does the Minister envisage the report will be ready?  I presume that will feed into the next phase of the roll-out of the programme.  Overall, the Minister has put a lot of work into the programme and it is something that will be beneficial to many people, especially artists.  I know of one very talented young artist ,who is not of Irish origin but because of comments made to him he gave up painting, which is very sad.  If a support mechanism like this had been in place it might have helped him along the way.  Many people tried to work with him and to encourage him and recently he went back to his art, having been away from it for many years.  He lost out of many years where he would have benefited from being involved in the arts.  This is a very helpful tool that will help artists right across the board.  I compliment the Minister and her team and wish them every success.

I welcome the opportunity to speak to Members and to hear their contributions on this important issue.  Since I became Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I have striven to bring about positive change.  The arts is an area that has always held a special place in my heart.  I am pleased that in my time in the Department I have managed to bring about change that I hope is of value to those who work in this area.  In the case of the Safe to Create programme, it is not just of value as the changes are so badly needed.  As Senator Black said, she was lucky.  We are very proud to have her in the Seanad.  She is such an accomplished singer, as are others in her family.  It should not just be a case of being lucky, it should be the norm and the standard.  If we are a country that is so proud of our artists, they should feel safe in their workplace.  I hope this will help to deliver that safety.<\/p> <p>I will go through the contributions of Senators before I sum up.  Senator Martin spoke first.  I am glad that he placed emphasis on the signing of the code, because that is a key part of the delivery of the programme.  The proposals for research in 2023 have already been received by my Department.  As Senator Warfield said, the research must be ongoing.  It is not just a case of doing it once, it must be a continuing process.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Clonan for raising the important issue of disability.  I am fully aware of the issue.  His contribution was based on his lived experience and was very eloquent and heartfelt.  I also have met Emilie Conway.  She is an inspiring person.  My Department and the Arts Council are engaging with officials in the Department of Social Protection and I have also made representations to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, on foot of the meeting with Emilie.  Although this issue is primarily one for the Minister for Social Protection, it is my goal to support all artists in every way possible.  We will continue that engagement.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for the work he did on the committee to inform this important subject.  When the report was launched, Members mentioned that Senator Warfield in particular drove it.  I commend him on putting the issue centre stage.  That was recognised by the members of the committee.  I like the idea Senator Malcolm Byrne had about mentors and leaders in this area.  I fully agree with what he said about organisations that do step up and adopt the code.  He will find that any organisation will find cold comfort the next time it applies for funding if it has not signed up.<\/p> <p>I am delighted that Senator Kyne visited the Safe to Create website.  I will pass his kind comments to the Irish Theatre Institute.  The Code on the Road workshop is in Galway today.  It will be in the Clarence Hotel in Dublin this Friday and Sligo next Monday.  I can inform Senator Maria Byrne that it was in Cork last week so it has been to the south.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#U00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#U00500","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Senator Kyne asked if it will continue.

They have been so courageous in speaking of their personal trauma in an effort to change it.  The work of the committee, my officials, the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council and fantastic organisations such as Mise Fosta and Fair Pl&eacute;, which have engaged, are changing the situation for the better.  I acknowledge that it was difficult and brave for those individuals to speak up.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In response to Senators Black and Warfield, the Speak Up report referred to the lack of accountability for organisations perpetrating or covering up harmful work behaviours, and the Senators asked what kind of accountability I am putting in place to ensure they do not receive State funding.  The majority of funding to the arts sector is done through the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions.  Both the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are leading on this by modifying their conditions of funding so that organisations that are found not to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will disqualify themselves from future funding streams.  That is the key action that may make people stand to attention.  All employers and organisations in the sector are being encouraged to adopt the code.  My Department officials are also in discussion with colleagues in government, including the Department of Justice, particularly on the third national strategy.<br\/><br\/>To return to the programme itself, as I have already outlined, the plan supports that Safe to Create platform.  I encourage Senators to spread the word about it.  The web address is <i>safetocreate.ie<\/i>.  The well-being and support service provided by Minding Creative Minds is free and provides valuable advice, counselling, legal advice and a 24-hour trauma helpline.  I urge Senators to tell everyone in the arts sector that this is here and it is free.  It is a free and invaluable service.  Based on our engagement with the sector, this is what they needed and wanted.  On a training programme developed specifically for the arts and creative sectors on dignity at work issues, all the courses are free and online.  On the code of behaviour I mentioned, the Code on the Road workshop roadshows, more research is key to keeping this up to date and to ensuring all the actions reflect what is needed as well as the monitoring and compliance.  Since its launch on 5 October, the Safe to Create team has been working to embed dignity at work everywhere in the sector.  For example, Ireland Music Week made the code of behaviour the pledge of its festival in October.  This was valuable marketing to raise awareness of Safe to Create in the music sector.  The Irish Theatre Institute was invited to speak about the Safe to Create programme at Theatre Forum's Tomorrow Together conference in Cork.  The Arts Council has arranged an art form resource organisation meeting on 22 November, and the Irish Theatre Institute will present to that meeting about Safe to Create.  The Arts Council is also looking at organising other Safe to Create meetings for its funded bodies in the first half of 2023.  In the coming months, my Department and the Irish Theatre Institute will be working with its partners to implement and promote these supports to monitor the impact of measures taken and to collaborate with the appropriate agencies to build effective monitoring, accountability and oversight mechanisms for harmful behaviour in the workplace in the arts sector in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I return to the brave people who made this change happen, those who work in the sector.  Those contributions have been the catalyst of change the arts sector very much needed.  I remind organisations to sign the code and individuals to do the training courses.  The three dignity at work courses take about an hour each.  We have made great progress, but this is the start of a journey that was badly needed to be taken.  There is a lot still to be done in the sector and in the programme, and I am absolutely committed to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#U00600","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I also wish to acknowledge and thank the members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for their consideration of the draft measures two weeks ago.  I understand that my opening statement is being circulated with a briefing note on the background to the draft regulations.<\/p> <p>In summary, the purpose of the draft regulations is to protect important statutory functions in respect of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, which can lead to a range of enforcement activities.  All three statutory bodies have the power to take civil court proceedings or adopt administrative measures in certain circumstances to enforce the law.  The bodies work closely with each other and other regulatory and enforcement authorities in Ireland and within the EU.<\/p> <p>When the general data protection regulation, GDPR, was introduced in 2018, it strengthened the rights of individuals in respect of the privacy and fair use of their personal data.  It also introduced a balancing provision, under Article 23, to ensure that this did not undermine the statutory functions of public bodies.  Accordingly, section 60 of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides that the statutory instruments we are considering today may be introduced to protect important objectives of general public interest.  Examples of such objectives specified in the Act and included in the draft instruments are: avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry; taking any action for the purpose of considering and investigating a complaint made to a regulatory body in respect of persons carrying out a profession or other regulated activity; and preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting breaches of the law that are subject to civil or administrative sanctions.  What is being prevented is the potential for data protection rights to be used as a way of undermining these and other essential functions.  This could be done by way of a data access request or multiple requests seeking the disclosure and possibly amendment or deletion of information that is part of an active investigation or inquiry that therefore fundamentally undermines the processes under way.<\/p> <p>Turning to the content of the draft regulations, each instrument is composed along the same lines of policy and technical approach.  They were prepared with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which we thank for its work, and in close consultation with the three bodies.  The draft regulations restrict data protection rights only in so far as is necessary and proportionate to protect the functions of the statutory agencies.  Therefore, any restrictions must be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Each body must notify the individual data subject and provide reasons for the restriction.  The data subject must also be informed of the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>In accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act, the Department consulted with the Data Protection Commission and the Minister for Justice on the draft regulations.  Following that consultative process, the Data Protection Commission wrote to confirm that it has not identified any matter which is of significant concern in relation to the proposed regulations.  The Minister for Justice has also acknowledged her agreement with the proposed measures.  The legal instruments are balanced and proportionate, and there are strong policy reasons for adopting the restrictions sought.  There is a reasonable expectation that the absence of restrictions to access to personal data will pose a serious risk to the statutory functions of these high-profile bodies.  It is in the public interest that they are able to function effectively and efficiently.  Therefore, for the purposes of their civil and administrative enforcement functions, it is appropriate that they be permitted to avail of the section 60 restrictions.  I commend the three separate statutory instruments to the House.  I thank the Acting Chairperson and the Senators for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#Z00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive opening statement.

Perhaps the Acting Chairperson should put his name forward.  He was running the House the last evening we were here and he was flying through the business of the House.  I commend him on continuing to do that work.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been here a number of times now.  I thank him for his help and support.  I welcome the draft regulations.  We all recognise the importance of data protection and of ensuring people have the privacy they are entitled to, but we must also ensure that authorities have the capacity to act in the public interest as required.  Currently, the CCPC, CEA and IAASA are operating without appropriate restrictions on data access regarding the civil and administrative function.  That represents a risk of the work they carry out in the public interest being undermined and it leaves these authorities legally vulnerable to a fine, or potentially damages, even when acting entirely in line with their mandate.  These regulations address that risk and, crucially, they do so in a fair and balanced manner.<\/p> <p>The regulations propose to restrict the rights and obligations provided for in the Data Protection Act, DPA, where it is necessary and proportionate to safeguard the statutory functions of the CCPC, CEA and IAASA.  An example of where it may be necessary is where the rights being exercised may interfere with or obstruct \"any official or legal inquiry, investigation or process\".  It is welcome that there will be no hard precedents as restrictions must be considered on a case-by-case basis following an assessment of the relevant circumstances.  In addition to restrictions being considered on a case-by-case basis, there are a number of other safeguards, with the CCPC, CEA and IAASA all being required to have appropriate policies and procedures in place.  Furthermore, these authorities are required to notify the data subject and provide reasons for the restriction, unless doing so may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective.  In addition, the data subject must be informed of the right or obligation affected by the restriction, whether the restriction applies in whole or in part, and of the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission.  It is important to note that the Data Protection Commission was consulted on these regulations and raised no concerns regarding them.  <\/p> <p>As I said earlier, and as I believe all Members agree, data protection is important and people have the reasonable expectation of privacy.  That must be balanced with ensuring these authorities have the capacity to meet their mandate and obligations which is what these regulations are aimed at ensuring.  The regulations do so in a balanced and appropriate manner.  It should also be noted that similar restrictions are already in place for the Central Bank of Ireland and the Office of the Ombudsman.  These regulations are necessary and should be welcomed by all.

The main thing is that the regulations are in the public interest.  I really like the idea that any of the restrictions that are going to be considered will be done on a case-by-case basis.  That is the main issue here.  I note the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, when he dealt with this in the committee, said that what was anticipated in the data protection regulations under article 23 of the data protection regulation, as well as section 60 of the Data Protection Act, may be restricted to protect what are referred to as \"important objectives of general public interest\".  One of these was identified as \"avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry, investigation, or process.\"  In practical terms, what is at issue here is the potential for data protection rights that are fundamentally directed at privacy and to the fair use of personal data to be used in a way that was not intended as a means of undermining, delaying, or derailing the Ombudsman's office in the performance of his or her duties.  That is very important and I believe it is only right that a person does not have the power to delay or upset any investigations that are going to take place in the public interest.<\/p><p>Section 9 is about the communication with the data subject and that the Ombudsman shall ensure that all information provided to a data subject, under or in relation to these regulations, is provided in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.  That is the most important piece in these regulations.  Whatever message is going to be conveyed to the person involved is going to be in the type of language that the person will easily understand because the regulations themselves are very legal in their terms.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House and I wish him well with these regulations.

We are happy to see the support for approval of these regulations.  The technical changes ensure that data protection regulations do not hinder the work of important functions of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Corporate Enforcement Agency, and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  Indeed, it has been made clear that issues around data protection regulations can have a detrimental effect on ongoing or potential investigations and on the enforcement of law.  Without introducing these new regulations, these agencies are also at risk of fines or are liable for damages under the current legislation.<\/p> <p>Of course we want people's rights to data privacy to continue to be protected, but it is also important that data protection rights do not undermine the work of these agencies.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is a statutory body responsible for promoting compliance with and enforcing competition and consumer protection law in Ireland, as well as providing information to consumers about their rights, personal finance, and product safety.  The commission's work in protecting consumer rights is as important as protecting data privacy rights, and is the right thing to do to ensure that balance is struck, and to ensure that abuse of the privacy legislation does not hinder the protection of other rights.<\/p> <p>Similarly, the work of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, and the Corporate Enforcement Authority, must also be uninhibited by this legislative gap.  The IAASA is responsible for the supervision of the accounting profession in Ireland, with oversight of statutory auditors, monitoring approval and registration, continuing education, quality assurance systems, and investigative and administrative disciplinary systems.<\/p> <p>The Corporate Enforcement Authority functions include enforcing and encouraging compliance with company law, investigating suspected offences under the Companies Act, prosecuting detected breaches of the Companies Act, referring cases to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution on indictment, and exercising a supervisory role over the activities of liquidators and receivers.  In short, Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#AA00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their inputs into the debate.

It is a very large group of people which has value in the sharing of information, particularly around safety.  However, I am concerned that a very large group of people are now responsible for creating and drafting a licenceholders' charter.  We know how important the licenceholders' charter is in steering and establishing a roadmap, guidance and all the regulatory frameworks that we expect our licence operators and holders to adhere to.  We speak of the pinnacle of safety and this charter is the cream of the crop.<\/p> <p>We are sitting in a large Seanad at the moment and we have all sat at committees where the larger the number of people on the committee the less productive it is, unfortunately.  When there is so specific a job as creating a licenceholders' charter it should be a very small, focused and targeted group that, first, provides the information that feeds into the charter based on best practice, research and everything that we would expect and adhere to.  It has to be a focused group and have a limited timeframe to provide the charter because if we leave it to the stakeholders' forum, we will be sitting here in a couple of years and still have no charter because the forum, which at least has agreed to meet twice a year, does not have the capacity to do that.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State proposes that the company shall, as soon as practicable and after consultation with the forum, publish a charter.  To my mind, that wording is extremely loose.  It does not really give any imperative or directive or give credibility to an extremely important document or licence to the people who own the licences that operate our airlines and carriers in this country.  Therefore, I have tabled an amendment to make a substitution for that section 4 in relation to the first meeting of the stakeholders' forum which will comprise a large number of people.  Once the chair is elected, hopefully by the forum members and not the CEO, the first meeting should set up a licenceholders' forum as a sub-committee.  We refer to that as the \"Licence holder&rsquo;s sub-forum\".  It should comprise representatives of the actual licenceholders in Ireland and also include, but not necessarily be limited to, all of our operators, pilots, cabin crew, engineers, air traffic controllers and anybody who has any input or involvement in the safe operation of aircraft carriers, airlines, operators and everything related to the safety of passengers and crew.  I hope that the licenceholders' sub-forum would meet at least twice a year or as frequently as required in order to establish a licenceholders' charter as quickly as possible.  We use language in law like \"as soon as is practicable\".  To my mind, this is something that is incredibly important and urgent and I am not alone in that thinking.  All our pilots and the current licenceholders share that view.  I want that very targeted sub-committee to develop procedures for the operation of our licenceholders' forum and then to submit it to both the company, I assume the chair designate will have a representative on this sub-committee, and also the Minister of State so that she can see exactly what their objectives are.  <\/p> <p>I want them to develop a licenceholders' charter at the earliest possible opportunity.  That should be no later than six months from the establishment of the forum.  I do not think that is cutting it too fine.  When it is developed, we should give it to the company and the Minister of State again for their perusal.  I would then like the licenceholders' charter to be made legal within 12 months.  There may be need for further engagement back and forth with the Department even though it does not have any aviation experts, as further interaction may be necessary.<\/p> <p>The licenceholders would like to see this regulatory charter enabled and enacted no later than 12 months after the establishment of the overall stakeholders' forum.  Therefore, for this to work well, we need the company to provide the facilities in order to host the meetings and to give them secretarial services.  I do not think it asks too much.  It asks a lot to expect a stakeholders' forum of maybe more than 40 or 50 organisations to have the wherewithal and directions to do what we seek, that is, to have a licenceholders' charter up and running within six months and legislated for within 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#MM00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.

Indeed, the IAA is looking at the models of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, stakeholder advisory board and the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, panel structure in terms of development of the forum and subgroups.  The purpose of the licenceholders' charter is for the IAA regulator to set out the standards of engagement it will undertake with licenceholders.  Section 76 foresees the IAA developing the licenceholders' charter and consulting on it with the forum.  Amendment No. 15 sees a subgroup of licenceholders developing the licenceholders' charter and subsequently submitting it to the IAA and the Minister.  In my view, this upends the relationship between the regulator and the regulated and, by including the Minister, interferes with the independence of the IAA.  The fundamental point we all want to achieve is that a forum is established that provides for the voices of relevant stakeholders, including licenceholders, to be heard, and that these voices contribute to the development of the charter.

There is nothing stopping it doing anything it wants to do.  It just has not done it to date, for the past 25 or 30 years.  That is the concern.  The lack of trust that currently exists in respect of engagements between licenceholders and the IAA has caused us to find ourselves at a point where we are perhaps trying to be, as the Minister of State put it, too prescriptive in legislation.  The reason for that is the lack of trust that exists.  While we have been discussing this Bill in recent years, the Minister of State has said the new broom within the IAA, the CEO-designate, is going to change that.  Well, he is no more and, therefore, he has not managed to change it.  We are now on an interim CEO and recruiting for a new one.  Some people may have the hope that the new CEO will change the culture that currently exists in Irish aviation but I do not have any faith or trust in that.  The Minister of State is telling me that, on a wink and a nod, the IAA can and will do this and that we do not need to tell it to do it, but it has not done anything to instil trust in an industry that has been so precarious in the context of safety, and we have seen the outcomes of that.  That does not fill me with confidence.  I accept that the amendment will be pressed and lost, and that is fine, but 12 months from now, when we still have no licenceholders' charter because no real engagement has taken place, whose responsibility will that be?  Will it be our responsibility because we allowed it to go off on our watch?  Will it be the responsibility of the Minister of State or her successor as Minister with responsibility for aviation?  Who is going to be responsible for the lack of trust that currently exists in an environment and an industry that is so precarious from a safety perspective, which is crying out for regulations in order that it would be regulated on a safety perspective or basis, and when the events the Minister of State has stated will happen have not happened?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#NN00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"vote","time":1667989800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 7; N\u00edl, 24.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Gerard P.

There have been many hours of conversation not only between Senators and the Minister of State but also between Senators and the CEO designate - who is no longer CEO designate - with regard to the culture of mistrust that exists that I mentioned in connection with the previous amendment.<\/p><p>What I am proposing are small changes to the review proposed in section 77, but they feed into the lack of trust and the culture that exists in the aviation industry between the regulator, the airlines and the licence holders.  The first thing I seek to amend is that subject to paragraph (b), the company will, at intervals no longer than three years, conduct a review.  The Minister of State is proposing to have a single review.  If that single review produces anything, it should be that there is a need to have recurring reviews in order that things can be amended.  The way section 77 is currently drafted means that the IAA will conduct a single review of crew peer support at whatever time it deems fit.  This is a missed opportunity.  We should say that the review should be conducted at intervals of no less than three years and then go on to say that, after the commencement of the Act, we will have a review completed within 12 months.  The Minister of State said that, but it is interesting that the first paragraph of her amendment indicates that a review will be carried out at whatever time the IAA may determine.  We want the review conducted within 12 months.  What is proposed in the section seems counterintuitive.  I am seeking to amend section 77 by stating that not only do we want a first review - which will be the first review of the crew peer support programme since it came into existence - but that we want it to happen every three years in order that we can change, learn, modify, adapt and improve what are non-uniform crew peer support programmes operated by the airlines in Ireland.  That is what is proposed in the first part of the amendment.<\/p><p>Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and so on of the amendment all seek to do exactly what the Minister of State is doing.  That is, until we reach the point where ambiguity has arisen as a result of the ambiguity contained in a letter written by the Minister of State in response to concerns raised by IALPA.  There seems to be a concern that, under the current EASA regulations, a licence holder or crew member can seek support from a crew peer support officer outside of his or her airline.  The Minister of State suggested in correspondence that the person involved would lose the sacrosanctity of privacy and of their personal information being kept within the organisation.  That is not mentioned anywhere in the EASA regulations.  It is not current practice and, therefore, is not the current law of the EU.  I am not sure from where the Minister of State got that information.  Perhaps she might clarify that.<\/p><p>We need to ensure that crew peer support people will be appointed by their peers and not by the management of the airlines, as continues to happen with some airlines.  It defeats the purpose of having somebody you can trust and go to if the person put in place for you to go to was appointed by management.<\/p><p>The second part of the differential between our amendment and the proposals in section 77 is that nothing should prejudice a person&rsquo;s right to seek assistance from a peer who works in a different organisation from the person seeking assistance from the support programme.  This is important because it was the Minister of State who created the ambiguity that now exists.  If not in this amendment, the Minister of State needs to seek a way to reinstate the clarity we had before the letter to IALPA.  If I worked in Aer Lingus and I wanted to go to the crew peer support person in Norwegian Airlines, there is no way I should be precluded from doing so, and I would not be precluded.  Furthermore, I would not lose any of the protections of the EU regulations in respect of my privacy or my protected status.  Nor would I lose out on the protective nature of what peer support is supposed to be.  We need to make matters implicit in the legislation, particularly in view of the ambiguity to which the response to IALPA gave rise.  Perhaps the Minister of State just needs to make it clear that what was contained in the response was a mistake or a drafting error and that it is not the case.  She might also to reiterate on the record that, regardless of what peer person is consulted and regardless of what airline a person works for, the EASA regulations ensure that a individual's privacy and dignity are respected as per the regulations.<\/p><p>I do not expect this amendment to be accepted.  We have shown the <i>laissez faire <\/i>attitude between the Department and the regulator.  We are drafting legislation in order that the IAA can regulate an industry, but we are literally giving it, on a wing and a prayer, the ability to determine what it does and does not do and when it does or does not do it.  Indeed, if the IAA does not want to do it at all, the legislation we are discussing ensures that does not have to it and can use its get-out-of-jail card.<\/p><p>We have been talking about this legislation now for two and a half years.  It has been amended significantly since it came to us from the D&aacute;il.  I thank colleagues for their support.  I have probably driven some of them mad over the past few months, but I have to tell them that this Bill is far better today than it was when it first came to the Seanad.  This shows the true value of scrutiny of the second House.  I am genuinely seeking that the Minister of State show leadership and say that peer support programmes are incredibly important.  If we do not value the employees - in this case, the licence holders - who have in their hands our safety every time we get onto one of their aeroplanes and if we do not value and respect the dignity of the programmes that are supposed to mind the mental and physical health and the well-being of those people, that says a great deal<\/p><p>I will press the amendment.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to the two minor changes to section 77 that I propose.  Most importantly, I would like clarity on the fact that she previously stated that an individual seeking assistance from a peer airline support person from another airline would prejudice his or her right to dignity, privacy and respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#PP00400","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Quite apart from contact with IALPA and individual pilots making contact with me, what has driven the debate over the past two and a half years is the Rescue 116 incident.

In the report on Rescue 116, we find countless errors and examples of unwillingness to listen.  A classic example is the overall lighting in the cockpit.  That has driven me through all of this.  If we had strong legislation in place and the ability for crew to go outside the organisations for which they work to seek support, things might have been highlighted much sooner and four lives might not have been lost.<\/p> <p>I totally concur with everything Senator Doherty said.

To restrict that support to within the organisation only simply would not work.  I ask the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to accept this amendment.

As Senator Doherty said, I believe we have the best we could get in the circumstances we have been working in.  It is still not perfect - it has a long way to go before it is - and I hope we do not find ourselves back in the House in a few years' time eating humble pie and trying to amend this legislation to bring in some of the matters we have talked about over the past two and a half years.

The regulation was developed in consultation with all stakeholders, including pilot representative bodies across Europe.  The final regulation represents a consensual balance of the views of all stakeholders.  The regulation came into effect in February 2021.  The IAA is the competent authority in Ireland in respect of the regulation.  All Irish airlines have a peer support programme in place and the IAA has audited all peer support programmes as per the EASA requirements.<\/p> <p>Having listened to the views of Senators on Committee Stage, I introduced section 77, which requires the IAA to undertake a review of the effectiveness of crew peer support programmes and, in doing so, to take into account most of the criteria as originally proposed by Senators, including addressing matters such as the promotion of use of a programme and the trust in it; independence of peers from management or supervisory functions; and the selection and training of peers.  Senators Craughwell and Doherty's amendment differs in three respects from the original text of section 77.  It requires that a pilot should be able to seek assistance from a peer not working in the same organisation, three-yearly reviews of peer support programmes by the IAA, and a review of the legislative provisions after a period of 12 months. <\/p> <p>In respect of the position that a pilot should be able to seek assistance from a peer not working in the same organisation, the EU regulation places the responsibility on airlines to ensure they have effective crew peer support arrangements in place.  A critical element in the process is for the airline to be guided by a peer as to when a pilot needs to be rostered off and supported.  The airline has to be satisfied the guidance is coming from a source it is satisfied with and has confidence in.  What is being envisaged by this amendment is a very different model from what pertains now.  It is unclear how it will be operationalised and what the consequences would be.  The proposal requires very serious and careful consideration and input from the IAA and EASA reviews and discussion at the aviation stakeholders' forum.  The IAA operates within a larger, integrated, single European civil aviation system.  We need to be mindful that we do not create a parallel set of national level requirements conflicting with our EU responsibilities.<\/p> <p>Turning to the proposal for three-yearly reviews of peer support programmes by the IAA and a review of the legislative provisions after a period of 12 months, it is important to note there will be two significant reviews of crew peer support in 2023 by both EASA and the IAA.  EASA has started its process to review the effectiveness of peer support programmes, which it will complete by October 2023.  The review will involve relevant stakeholders and will be based on data gathered with support from member states, EASA and other stakeholders.  The target stakeholder groups are national competent authorities, such as the IAA, aircraft operators, flight and cabin crew, and other safety-sensitive personnel, in addition to associations representing pilots and cabin crew, airlines, and aviation psychologists and psychiatrists.  Section 77 of the Bill as passed on Committee Stage already requires the IAA to undertake a review of crew peer support programmes operated by airlines within 12 months of commencement of the Bill and to publish the outcome of the review on its website. The IAA aims to conduct its review in parallel with the EASA review.  I believe the output from these two reviews will provide the evidential basis for policy and legislative development in respect of crew peer support.  As such, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#QQ00200","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister of State said, except for two points.

This is not the current practice and it is not precluded by EASA regulations.  We absolutely have licence holders going to peers outside their own airlines at present because, as the Minister of State well knows, we have airlines whose management appoint the peers but they do not have the trust of people.<\/p> <p>Either the Minister of State is misinformed - I would like her to confirm that maybe she is - or her understanding of the current practices under the EASA regulations at present is ill-informed.  Maybe that is why the letter she sent to IALPA suggested that, if anybody went to peer support outside their own airline, they would lose the privacy and dignity entrusted to them within the EASA regulations.  Absolutely nowhere in the regulations does it state that somebody has to go to the peer support person within their own airline but, more important, because the practice is that some licence holders are going to peers outside their own airlines, the Minister of State must confirm to this House that she does not believe, and it is not the practice, that people are losing the respect, privacy and dignity they would get in their interactions with whatever peer they go to.  She has just suggested and put on the record that they will, which is a very dangerous place for us to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#QQ00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1667989800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1667989800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Fifth Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#QQ00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#QQ00700","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

While there may be differences in the jets stream around what we are trying to achieve, ultimately, this Bill is about reform.  In tandem with that, it is about safety, security, regulation and consumer protection.  At the heart of our debate, in the nuances and amendments, the motivation has been about that.<\/p> <p>Having served as the chair of a committee and being here 15 years, and hopefully mellowing and maturing a small bit, one has to listen to the wider engagement with &ndash; I hate using the word \"stakeholder\" &ndash; those involved and those in the know.  While the Minister of State and those involved in the industry were very much of the view that this Bill should be passed as a matter of urgency, because it is extremely important, there was a need to engage.  We need to give the Minister of State credit today.  She listened and made amendments, notwithstanding the sincere views of my colleague, Senator Doherty, about the flaws.  That is what our parliamentary democracy is about.  The importance of pre-legislative scrutiny is making legislation better and ensuring that we ultimately achieve that.<\/p> <p>I raised issues at the beginning of the Bill, having had representations from members of the staff around the vesting day and their rights and entitlements in the transfer.  Our aviation sector is very important.  We are an island nation dependent upon connectivity and dependent upon airlines.  We are blessed.

It would be remiss of me not to thank the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, for its engagement with all of us and its genuine concern for its members.

I thank the Senators for their contributions and the amendments they tabled, some of which will now be included in the Bill before it is returned to the D&aacute;il.  While we may not have agreed on all of the provisions in this Bill, we have worked constructively to reach a compromise on a number of provisions, including crew peer support programmes - the amendment introduced following our engagements - which will require the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, to undertake a review the effectiveness of the crew peer support programmes, the amendment providing for the IAA to convene an aviation stakeholders forum and the provision requiring the IAA to publish a licence holders charter setting out the standards of engagement that will be undertaken by the IAA with the holders of licences.  Our constructive engagement has also seen an amendment introducing reducing from five years to three years the time interval for statutory safety examinations of the IAA.  Connected to this is the amendment removing the Minister&rsquo;s discretion to withhold publication and to require publication of the report on a website maintained by the Government.  Finally, an amendment to provide that the IAA consult with stakeholders in the preparation of its statement of strategy has been introduced.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides for significant institutional changes to how aviation is regulated in Ireland.  Specifically, at a high level, it provides for the separation of the IAA with the safety regulation side of the IAA to be merged with Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, to create a stand-alone aviation regulator.  The Bill also sees new mechanisms being introduced with regard to aviation regulation and engagement, for example, the forum and charter and new responsibilities for the IAA in response to an aviation sector that has changed significantly over the past 29 years since the enactment of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.  This Bill, upon enactment, will make a real difference to how aviation is regulated in Ireland for the benefit of the travelling public and the aviation industry alike.<\/p> <p>I thank my officials who have put in a significant amount of work on this Bill and have been completely engaged throughout the process and wanted to work with colleagues across the House.

She has had a long afternoon in the Chamber but we are always pleased to see her.  I am pleased my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in the Seanad agreed to use our Private Members' time for this important debate on public transport and on extending the short-hop zone to 50 km, which would include the towns of Newbridge and Kildare and more - there are six towns that would be affected - in addition to extending a medium-hop zone to 75 km away from the centre.  This would be important for my own town of Newbridge and for many other commuter counties around Leinster particularly in Meath and Wicklow.<\/p> <p>The short-hop zone is Irish Rail's Dublin area network and within this network, an integrated smart Leap card can be used for rail travel.  The zone extends north to Balbriggan on DART and northern commuter services, south to Greystones on the DART and southern commuter services, east to Howth, west to Kilcock on Longford commuter services, and west to Sallins and Naas on the Portlaoise commuter services.  The Leap fare capping applies to this zone, meaning that passengers pay a maximum daily or weekly amount.  This hop zone means commuters living within the zone who opt to use public transport can avail of huge savings when compared with commuters living just outside the zone boundary.  In my view the short-hop zone is the correct policy and it has been very successful in attracting passengers and commuters to public transport and away from using private cars on the road.  That is absolutely what we want.  <\/p> <p>However the boundaries simply do not go far enough.  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for looking at some of the countries within the OECD for comparisons and for doing price analysis comparison in the particular areas we are talking about.  When I make a comparison, if we were to extend to 50 km outside Dublin, and this could also be applied to Galway or Cork, the new areas that would be included would be Gormanston, Laytown and Enfield in County Meath, Newbridge and Kildare town in County Kildare, and Wicklow town in County Wicklow.  Looking at the price variation in Sallins at present, which is the next stop before Newbridge, the price per kilometre is 26 cent and Newbridge is 51 cent.  If we bring it further and look at Kildare, Monasterevin and Portarlington, it is 50 cent, 45 cent and 40 cent per kilometre, respectively.  If we take the prices based on kilometre, the difference is between 26 cent and 51 cent for Newbridge and then it goes down for towns that are further. out.  I would say that the people of Newbridge who use the train station are completely discriminated against in terms of price.  <\/p> <p>If we look at average fares for all passengers on the Dublin to Portlaoise commuter service, which is the one that comes through Sallins and Newbridge, at this present the single fare between Sallins and Naas is &euro;4.75 but to Newbridge is &euro;14.30.  When comparing a fare of &euro;4.75 with one of &euro;14.30, it is simply not good enough.  This motion seeks to improve the affordability metrics for commuters who reside outside the short-hop boundaries and to level the playing field for residents of the same area.  For example, I mentioned my home town of Newbridge, County Kildare.  Because Newbridge is not within the confines of the short-hop zone, commuters cannot benefit from the Leap card or fare arrangements.  What happens is that a lot of people who live close to Newbridge station and could walk there get into their cars to drive to Sallins to avail of the cheaper fare and who can blame them?  Irish Rail has extended the car park in Sallins to accommodate the extra cars and that causes chaos, with people going from Newbridge over a single bridge to Sallins in the morning.  There are parents who drive their children to Sallins.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Basically what happens is that many people, who live close to Newbridge station and could walk there, are getting into their cars and driving to Sallins to avail of the cheaper fair and who can blame them?  What has Irish Rail done?  It has extended the carpark in Sallins to accommodate the extra cars.  This causes chaos for those travelling from Newbridge over the one bridge to Sallins in the morning.  Parents are driving their children to Sallins.  I appreciate there has been a reduction of 50% for young people under 23 years of age on trains but at the same time, there is still that huge price differential.  While I absolutely support the extension of Local Link transport, which provides a bus service to link Newbridge with Sallins rail station, it is getting away from the issue.  We need to have affordable fares from Newbridge station.  To purchase a return ticket from Newbridge to Dublin Heuston this morning, with the 20% discount, would have cost me &euro;16.90 and that is just from station to station and does not include the internal travel within Dublin - say to come to Leinster House from Heuston station.  If I was travelling from Sallins within the short-hop zone, I could get from Newbridge to Heuston and back for &euro;7.20.  That is a 57% price differential for two stations that are 12.3 km apart.  It is not fair and needs to be addressed.  I know it is not just an issue in my own area.  I am aware from conversations with Senators in my own party, such as Senator Casey, that this is happening on all fringes of the zone.  This drastic price differential is forcing many commuters to drive themselves to a station within the short-hop zone to avail of the cheaper cards and the Leap card capping facility.  This capping facility is very important because it also means you can travel on any different mode of public transport within the city centre on your Leap card.  Without it, you are actually confined to just one mode: the 145 bus.  That is not going to be suitable for everybody who arrives into Heuston station.  I spoke to the National Transport Authority, NTA, about this and it brought up the price of installing new equipment and the fact that there would have to be somebody on duty all of the time.  To be honest, the cost would be minimal.  When it suits Irish Rail and the NTA to call Newbridge a commuter zone, for example, when they refuse to have the toilets open, they say the station is a commuter belt area which does not need toilets but then when it comes to looking for the extension of the short-hop zone, it is not treated in the same way.  It is a crazy situation.<\/p><p>The D&aacute;il and the Seanad passed the climate Act and Ireland is now on a legally-binding path to net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  We are looking at a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade and, as it stands, we have people driving single-occupancy vehicles past their local public train station to go to another station because we are crucifying them with fares.  It makes absolutely no sense.  At present, the short-hop zone applies to all rail travel on all Irish Rail services between destinations within 35 km - measured by track distance not point-to-point - of either of Dublin's two primary central rail stations, namely, Heuston or Connolly stations.<\/p><p>The motion I put forward is now Fianna F&aacute;il policy and I thank our spokesperson on transport, Deputy O'Connor, and Deputy Barry Cowen, who looks after that policy area, for their support.  We are calling for an extension of the short-hop zone to a 50 km radius and the establishment of a medium-hop zone within a 75 km radius which would include Portarlington.  This would make a huge difference to the catchment area.  In terms of population growth in Kildare, the amount of people who travel outside the county for work has grown considerably.  To be able to support this group of people with public transport and fair fares would be hugely important.  In many cases, it would cut down the need for a second car in families as well.  For a town that has exploded in terms of population, this would be a huge success story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#VV00900","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>As a courtesy, I will tell the Senator she has six minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#WW00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#WW00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I rest my case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#WW00400","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>If we are to meet our climate targets, we need to make public transport more reliable and useable but, crucially, more affordable.

I rest my case.  I have already spoken about the differential between the kilometre-by-kilometre cost.  That cost differential is absolutely unacceptable.  I acknowledge the significant budgetary supports in budget 2023 such as the maintenance of the 50% reduction in public transport fares for young people, the extension to 15, 17 and 18-year-olds and mature students, and of course the 20% reduction all fares.  It is really important we extend the short-hop zone and a medium-hop zone is established.  I pay tribute in my closing remarks to the tireless advocacy of Jennifer Caffrey from Newbridge and a group of very dedicated committed commuters who keep the elected representatives in the area on our toes regarding this issue.  They have done incredible work.  The Minister of State has my full support and that of my party.  I hope by the conclusion of this debate she will have the full support of this House.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Senator Casey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#WW00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Senator Casey has a little in excess of four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#WW00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Senator O'Loughlin, for introducing this motion.  One strategy at the heart of Government is about getting as many people on public transport as we can.  We see this as the future.  If this is a Government aspiration, looking at the short-hop zone and its success for the people who live within that zone in terms of access to services but more importantly access to reduced fares, it must be extended beyond that zone.  As my colleague said, we need to create a medium zone and maybe a wider zone if we are honestly talking about moving people onto public transport.  Regarding the fares, Kilcoole is the last stop within the short-hop zone in County Wicklow.  The fare is &euro;3.90.  Moving 10 km down the road to Wicklow town, you pay &euro;10.45.  That is a 165% price differential between the two.  Moving on to Arklow, which is another 15 km away, the fare becomes &euro;15.75.  That is a 300% increase.  If we provide the right fare structure and the right service, we will get people onto public transport.  Cork is a good example.  When the Cork city to Mallow fare of &euro;3.90 was introduced, the number of passengers doubled almost immediately.  If we honestly believe in public transport, it has to be a priority for Government to seriously look at this motion and consider introducing medium and long zones in public transport for people who are coming from commuting counties to work in Dublin.  This aligns with my point of view in Wicklow because once you leave that short-hop zone there, not alone are you crucified by a lack of rail service but also by the lack of a bus corridor on the N11.  Even our buses are getting stuck and blocked up in traffic.  For commuters coming from Kilcoole or further south, access to Dublin is a nightmare.  There are only two train services in the morning.  The 133 Bus &Eacute;ireann service and the Wexford Bus route, all have to go through the Devil's Glen which is carpark.  From a Wicklow commuter's point of view, not alone do we need to improve access to public transport, we also need the people of Wicklow town, Rathdrum and Arklow to have fairness and equally with public transport users in Kilcoole and beyond.  This is the reason I am fully supportive of this motion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Following my talks with Irish Rail and with the National Transport Authority, NTA, I believe we honestly need to look at the rail service from Greystones onwards.

I am taking this debate today on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who could not be here.<\/p> <p>I am confident we can all agree that it is essential that Government continues to invest in the public transport network, and that we are supportive of the Government's commitment towards delivering an accessible, affordable and reliable public transport network throughout the country.  I can confirm that Government is not opposing the motion which has been brought forward this evening.  However, while the overall objective of this motion is broadly in line with the principles of this Government, there are some issues within the motion which require clarification, and which will be highlighted this evening.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.  To support this key Government objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured approximately &euro;538 million of funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year.  More recently, &euro;563 million has been secured as part of the budget 2023 negotiations for the continued improvement of these services.  In order to incentivise young people to use public transport, funding was secured for the introduction of a young adult card, which allows any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years of age to avail of a 50% discount on all PSO services and since September, also on participating commercial services.  This initiative was recently widened to allow 16 to 18-year-old third level students to apply for the student Leap card so that they can also avail of the discount.  Furthermore, in order to help combat the rising cost of living being experienced throughout the country, Government introduced a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services.  The recently agreed budget 2023 helps support our transport objectives and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country.  We have extended the 20% fare reduction on PSO services so that everyone will benefit until the end of 2023.  Equally, we have extended the 50% reduction available for young adults on both PSO and commercial bus services until the end of 2023 and we are supporting new and enhanced bus and rail services throughout 2023 as well.  These are all part of the &euro;563 million funding package to support PSO services.  That package is hugely significant in the context of providing accessible and affordable transport options.<\/p> <p>With regard to the short hop zones, given the current cost-of-living crisis and various pressures on the Exchequer across the system, budget 2023 is focused on delivering the maximum benefit for all passengers.  Funding was, therefore, directed toward the fare initiatives and funding has not been provided within the budget to extend the short hop zones or to create new medium hop zones.  However, the issues raised by Senators are acknowledged, and the NTA is examining what needs to be done to ensure that the distance-based fare outside the short hop zone is in line with the distance-based fare inside the short hop zone to ensure that the fares will be more equitable.  This work is ongoing as part of a national fares review for rail and bus services.  When the Leap card infrastructure was first introduced in 2011, it was necessary for the NTA to define the scope and scale of Leap card implementation for budgetary and project management purposes.  The boundary of the greater Dublin area short hop zone was determined to be the limit of the deployment of Leap-enabled equipment on rail services, such as pole mounted smart card validators and station gates.  Leap ePurse is, therefore, used for rail journeys within the greater Dublin area, as well as Cork commuter rail services on the Cork-Cobh and Cork-Midleton lines, and is very effective.  However, it is less-well suited to longer distance trips and, therefore, higher fares.  The NTA and Irish Rail are currently developing a mobile App ticketing option that will offer a digital payment service to longer distance commuters.  As part of this work, it is likely that fares for commuter journeys of up to 50 km from Dublin city will see reductions.  While it is not possible at this stage to determine individual fares, a consistent methodology will be applied to ensure that fares increase appropriately in line with distance travelled beyond the 90-minute fare boundary and to remedy the disparities which currently exist outside the short hop zone.  It is expected that these proposals will form part of budget 2024's considerations.  The NTA is also considering a more equitable distance-based fare system for the commuter rail network generally.  This work is ongoing as part of a national fares review for rail and bus services.  There is a view that rather than introducing a simple extension to short hop zone boundaries and effectively merely move the issue further down the network, a more equitable approach would be to ensure that the distance-based fares approach outside of the current short hop zones is in line with the distance-based fares approach within the current short hop zones.  I acknowledge the motion has also thought about this issue with its proposal to introduce a new layer of zonal ticketing - the medium hop zone - but the fundamental issue would still arise.  The issue is simply moved around the network.  In the interim, the NTA has implemented the Government's 20% cost-of-living average fares reduction as part of its latest fares determination, which will continue to apply in 2023 on all subsidised PSO public transport services.  Young adult fares are also now available on all PSO services, providing a 50% fares reduction compared to equivalent adult fares.<\/p> <p>The Government also has ambitious plans for public transport infrastructure nationwide.  The programme for Government commits to a \"fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland\" and this is supported by the national development plan which has allocated &euro;35 billion to maintain, enhance and improve transport infrastructure across the country over the next ten years.  The substantial investment in transport in recent years and the planned ramping up of major projects such as BusConnects in every city, Connecting Ireland in rural areas, the Cork Area Commuter Rail Programme, DART+ and MetroLink means that the national public transport landscape will continue to transform for the better in the coming years.  Under Project Ireland 2040, spatial planning and capital investment are being linked together in a meaningful way, while significant levels of investment are being put towards new public and sustainable transport initiatives, as well as major new road projects.  Furthermore, capacity on the Kildare, Maynooth and northern rail lines is being increased by more than 30% compared to today.  In fact, the new railcars to achieve this increase have already started to arrive and will be entering service next year.  The third phase of BusConnects was rolled out in May this year and introduced two new northern orbital routes: the N4, connecting Blanchardstown to Point Village; and N6, connecting Finglas with Howth Junction.  More recently, phase 4 of BusConnects commenced on 16 October with the introduction of G spine routes G1, G2 and Route 60, operated by Dublin Bus.<\/p> <p>Regarding our rail network, the strategic rail review, which is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, will inform the development of inter-urban-inter-regional rail on the island of Ireland over the coming decades.  The review will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.  The Department of Transport expects the review to be completed by the end of this year.  The review will set the type of strategic backdrop to rail investment in our regions and on our mainline network and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  This review will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing or future potential corridors of the network, and that scope will include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines.  It will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years.  The Government has ambitious plans for our national rail network and has committed to an extensive programme of capital investment projects over the coming years.  These plans include projects such as the DART+ programme, which will create a full metropolitan DART network for Dublin, with all lines linked and connected.  When completed, the DART expansion programme will provide high frequency electrified services to Maynooth, Hazelhatch, Drogheda and Greystones.  As well as upgrades to the railway infrastructure, DART+ includes the purchase of new electric and battery-electric train fleet, along with provision of new depot and stabling facilities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Further, the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area 2016-2035 specifically identifies new rail stations at Cabra, Glasnevin, Heuston West, Kylemore, Woodbrook, west of Sallins, west of Louisa Bridge and west of Maynooth.  Kishoge station will also open in the short term as development of the Clonburris strategic development zone is realised.  Additionally, the Cork area commuter rail programme involves development and enhancements to the rail network over approximately 62 km from Mallow through Cork city and on to Cobh and Midleton.  This will include electrification and re-signalling across the three main routes, primarily over existing alignments and an application for planning permission for phase 1 of this programme was recently lodged.  Meanwhile, the east coastal railway infrastructure protection projects involve the identification and implementation of infrastructural protection strategies for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann infrastructure on the east coast of Ireland.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to providing a comprehensive national transport network which connects our people and places.  For this reason, this Government has an ambitious vision to transform transport services and infrastructure nationwide, with one of the key priorities for public transport being the roll-out of the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan.  For example, under Connecting Ireland, the NTA is proposing an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of this five-year plan.  Hundreds of rural villages and areas will for the first time be served by a viable public transport link.  Service improvements are already being rolled out under Connecting Ireland, with more planned before the end of this year.  The Seanad will be aware that Connecting Ireland will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country.  Connecting Ireland aims to enhance existing services and introduce new public transport services.  Implementation of this programme will continue at the pace as outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available.<\/p><p>This motion is generally in line with the principles of this Government and is broadly acceptable in a number of its aspects, particularly its call to move toward a more equitable distance-based fare rate for commuter rail.  As I have outlined, however, certain specific elements of the motion are unlikely to feature as part of any future equitable distance-based fare system.  I assure the Seanad that the Government fully recognises the hugely important role that public transport plays in all our lives and is acutely aware of the concerns raised concerning public transport this evening.  These ambitious investment plans in the public transport sector over the coming years, such as Dart+, BusConnects and Connecting Ireland, will go a long way towards achieving these goals.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made this year with fare reductions and funding has been secured as part of the 2023 budget negotiations for the continuation of these initiatives to the benefit of public transport users throughout the country.  Furthermore, the work the NTA is currently undertaking on distance-based public transport fares will help to address some of the issues raised this evening.  l firmly believe that with the work done in recent years and our ambitious plans for public transport, we will build a much more efficient framework for the provision of public transport in Ireland.

The devil is in the detail though.  At the end of that very comprehensive run-around of the national transport network, the Minister of State's conclusion said it all.  She said that, &quot;This motion is generally in line with the principles of this Government and is broadly acceptable in [terms of] aspects, particularly [in] its call to move toward a more equitable&quot; system.  The Minister of State then went on to talk about the creation of a new medium hop zone as being &quot;unlikely to feature as part of any future equitable distance-based fare system&quot;.  This is telling us the answer and this is the detail.  When <i>The Kildare Nationalist<\/i>or whatever local paper decides to talk about this story we need to set it in this context.<\/p><p>I am very familiar with the stations in Portarlington, Monasterevin, Athy and Sallins.  I am also familiar with the stations in Bray, Wicklow and Arklow, which we touched on earlier as well.  Given we have had the benefit of the Minister of State reading her response into the Official Record, I wish to take up the detail not with the proposers of the motion but with her.  I want to share my comments with the House as well.  What I was going to refer to regarding Deputy Richmond, and what he has in common with Deputy Alan Farrell and, indeed, with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, is that they have all spoken in favour of having some sort of greater security on our public transport network.  It will be recalled that I am a strong advocate of having a designated transport police system.  We had this proposal in this House but it was rejected by the Government parties through a roll call vote, and the record stands.<\/p><p>Subsequently, however, we have had many issues concerning public safety.  The Minister of State has, rightly, spoken about the Government's policy for public transport.  I remind her now, in saying this again, that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, published a report entitled Travelling in a Woman's Shoes.  This referred to surveys and the real-life experiences of women in fear of travelling on our public transport network.  This is the reality of the situation.  This is one issue, and then we have the issue of disability.  I am familiar, for instance, with the station in Newbridge, where people are having difficulty accessing a public toilet.  I am not referring to people with disabilities, but they too are experiencing this problem.  People are being told they have to get a key from somewhere and that someone will stand outside the door.<\/p><p>We are talking about public transport and safe public transport.  We are talking about men and women being able to go around on public transport and not be abused verbally or physically, which is a common experience now.  We have heard of terrible beatings, intimidation, slurs, hate speech and hate crimes occurring on our public transport, and yet we do not have a designated transport police force.  I want to leave my focus on this issue with the Minister of State.  We cannot make a decision today, but when we look back at some statements made by Deputies Alan Farrell and Richmond, and, indeed, by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, these show they have all come out in favour of this proposition.  They are all in Government, but somehow it is not all adding up.<\/p><p>I will leave the Minister of State with these short messages.  I want clean and safe toilets in the stations in Portarlington, Monasterevin, Athy, Sallins, Bray, Wicklow, Arklow and in every other station on our transport network.  I want people, men and women, to be able to travel on our public transport safely.  It is important to address this point.  I took a look, strangely, at Fine Gael's website, and I acknowledge this with thanks to the party.  I say this because, in the names of Deputy Phelan and Senator McGahon, the website refers to high parking costs.  These words are presented in these clipped, tight, concise press releases on the Fine Gael website.  References are made to the need for the high parking costs of rail commuters to be reduced in line with new lower public transport fares.  Furthermore, it is stated that lower parking costs for rail commuters would encourage even more people to take trains, which will be beneficial both for the climate and concerning the cost-of-living perspective.<\/p><p>Many people across parties, therefore, are dealing comprehensively with transport policy and some of our issues in this area.  It is much more complex than just the hop, stop and move aspect and various tariffs and rates.  This is about how people, particularly in rural communities, get to the transport networks.  They have to park their cars and pay their fees.  The Minister of State will be familiar with this aspect as someone who represents a constituency that has both urban and rural elements.  There are challenges in this regard.<\/p><p>I will leave it at this.  I reiterate my call that we should have cross-party support for the creation of a designated public transport police to allow people to travel safely.  Who is going to go out on the DART tonight at 8 p.m. to travel to Drogheda and feel safe doing so?  Not too many people will, and this is the reality.  Many people are forced to do it, but not many are comfortable doing it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would like to think public toilets will be open for people with disabilities and everybody else in the meantime.<\/p><p>I also wish to address the issue of how, in rural communities, we are linking people from rural towns and villages into the network and how they can have a reasonable fee for parking and fares.

I commend Senator O'Loughlin on this important motion.  As a member of the Oireachtas transport committee, I recognise this issue is pertinent to the Senator in her area.  In my work as transport spokesperson, in advance of tonight's motion and in general, I have engaged with many councillors and public representatives.  The NTA, Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland were before the transport committee yesterday.  We have a huge issue with public transport.  If we are to have any semblance of credibility around that modal shift, there needs to be accountability and transparency in that accountability by the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  My colleague, Councillor Sharon Tolan, has been campaigning for a long time on this issue.  Our parliamentary party passed a motion unanimously at our meeting in June supporting the demands in the motion tonight.  As for the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, as has been well documented, it is sitting in the Department at the same time as thousands of people tonight who wish to use bus or rail continue to avoid it because of the continued disparity of train fares and the lack of Leap card technology.  We heard yesterday at the transport committee that the real-time information was not working, as well as the issue of Leap cards.<\/p> <p>The rail line is currently not fulfilling its full potential.  Many commuters are choosing to either drive to a short-hop zone, SHZ, station, to avail of a more affordable ticket or remain in their cars, as Senator Boyhan referred to.  Life is not as easy or simple as Senator Boyhan thinks and I am surprised, given that he is from a former Government party, the Progressive Democrats, that he recognises that we have the NTA and TFI working to develop and deliver public transport, but I will not get into that now.<\/p> <p>As Meath County Council members will know, in a post-Covid-19 survey proposed by Councillor Tolan, 22,000 vehicles were going through Julianstown.  Imagine the number of people that could be taken off the road.  In advance of today, we spoke about Leap card facilities; they are very useful.  Students hop on and off different modes of transport, including stations in the commuter belt area.  I ask the Minister that Gormanston and Laytown be used as examples of short-hop zones and for the issue of reduced fare extension, with an eye to where there are boundaries.  Laytown is 56 minutes from Connolly Station and therefore should be included.  I thank Councillor Tolan, who has been a champion of that.  I have been in constant dialogue as a member of the transport committee with my friend, Deputy Heydon, and the councillors in County Kildare who have raised the issue, as Senator O'Loughlin has tonight, about the inequality of commuters.  To be fair, Senator Wall from County Kildare will recognise that in the areas of Newbridge, Kildare town and Monasterevin, there is a disparity with other stations around the county.  As I had the privilege of spending five years in Maynooth, I know County Kildare reasonably well and have many friends there.  I was recently in Maynooth University on the old campus.  Maynooth town benefits from the issue of public transport, as an example.  I make the point, as I am sure Senator Wall will and as Senator O'Loughlin eloquently and powerfully did, that there needs to be parity of fares and equality of treatment.<\/p> <p>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Minister of State may expect me to do, I reference the issue of Cork, which the Minister of State mentioned in her speech.  I commend Irish Rail on the Cork area commuter rail programme.  It is an important project.  It is not about Middleton or Mallow; it is also about the city and ensuring that, from Cobh to Middleton and going east to Mallow and the city, commuter rail is put in place.  If there is to be any serious notion of tackling the issue of the modal shift or tackling the climate crisis we face, a city of the scale of Cork needs to have BusConnects working properly.  While phase 1 is complete, we are now entering a critical phase of engagement.  I appeal to the NTA that there needs to be ongoing dialogue to allay concerns and persuade people as there are huge issues around BusConnects in Cork, in terms of the first proposition.  In fact, our Taoiseach complained about it and Fianna F&aacute;il councillors on Cork City Council tabled a motion to the council about it.  You cannot do one thing and be for something else.  It is important in the context of the Cork commuter rail programme that we support the work of A.J. Cronin and his team in Cork.  I am excited about public transport for Cork.  We have seen the success of the 24-hour bus routes.  We need to see Cork commuter rail commence in the city.<\/p> <p>I will conclude on the issue of public transport police.  I was at the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, conference in Cork.  Senator Boyhan did not reference me in his contribution.  I am on record in this House as being in favour of a dedicated public policing unit for public transport.  Again, it is not as simple as Senator Boyhan would suggest in terms of its implementation as that entails the involvement of the Garda and the Department of Justice, as well as the issues of cost, training and recruitment.  There needs to be a mind shift around the provision of public transport policing.  We need a dedicated public transport corps because there are issues around transport, commuter and staff safety for the staff who work in our public transport system.  I thank Senator O'Loughlin for this motion.  It is important.  It is about people.  If we are talking about a modal shift and if we are asking people to invest in rural Ireland and areas outside of Dublin, then the Government should support and embrace this motion wholeheartedly.

The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy for Kildare South, Deputy Patricia Ryan, has been raising the issue of the impact of the short-hop zones on people in her constituency for a long time.  People are driving to Sallins in north County Kildare, as we have heard, to use more affordable public transport.  We all know that as part of our climate targets and emissions reductions, one of the key ways we can address those in transport is to reduce the number of car journeys, especially short-distance journeys.  We have a discrepancy, as the motion states, in the pricing structure of public transport.  It is incentivising people to get into their cars and drive part of the journey to where public transport is significantly cheaper instead of encouraging people to take public transport for the entire journey.  We all agree with the principle of this motion.  It is a fantastic idea.  Anything that can encourage people out of their cars and reduce costs for them has to be welcomed.  It is a straightforward measure that should be implemented.<\/p> <p>Looking on from the Opposition, however, we have to question what the point is in moving a Seanad motion about the issue.  We can all stand up and make speeches but the budget was announced only a few weeks ago.  There were no proposals from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party around the short-hop zones.  Sinn F&eacute;in allocated &euro;2 million to extending short-hop zones in our alternative budget.  Nothing was allocated at the time, when it mattered, when we could have done something about the issue being raised tonight.  It is a pattern we see repeated when it comes to the public transport policing unit, as others have said.  Fianna F&aacute;il made a big song and dance about calling for the measure - I remember them being out on the plinth having a press conference.  When it comes down to doing something about it in the budget, however, it is nowhere to be seen.  Sinn F&eacute;in did not just call for public transport policing, we also allocated for it in our alternative budget.<\/p> <p>Another thing Sinn F&eacute;in called for and allocated resources for in our alternative budget was the accelerated roll-out of the connecting Ireland rural bus scheme.  We also allocated for the Navan rail line and the western rail corridor.  Meanwhile, in this motion, there is very little for most of the country.  It is a relatively straightforward measure for a few limited examples close to Dublin in counties Kildare and Wicklow.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I said, while we welcome the measures in this motion, we would like to see more talk in the parliamentary party meetings with the Ministers and at the time when we can deliver the changes to see action on this, rather than when we are here using Private Members&rsquo; time instead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#ZZ00700","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>This is a debating chamber, by the way.

The extension of the short hop zone to Newbridge station in my county of Kildare is an issue that I and Labour Party colleagues in Newbridge and south Kildare have been working on for some time.  The campaign has included all of the rail stations in this part of the State.  Indeed, as part of our campaign for a so-called &ldquo;fare&rdquo; deal for south Kildare commuters, I, along with members of the Newbridge branch of the Labour Party, met with Anne Graham, CEO of the National Transport Authority, NTA, in 2018 to hand over 7,000 signatures from the campaign we have run and are continuing to run.  At that meeting and in much correspondence since, we have been told the NTA is responsible for setting fares, and indeed every piece of correspondence from the Government has stated that.  However, in the absence of appropriate Government funding to fund any fare reductions, we are continually told the hands of the NTA are tied.<\/p> <p>That argument was also used with my colleagues and it has already been referenced in this debate.  My colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, started a similar campaign back in 2016 to include Mallow train station in the Leap card fares, thereby reducing fares from that station in Cork as well.  After Deputy Sherlock succeeded in his campaign this year by adding Mallow to the Leap card fares, the evidence told its own story.  Passenger numbers have almost doubled from the station.  From May 2021 to the beginning of September 2021, they stood at 44,000, whereas the same figure for this year sees an almost doubling of that figure to 77,000 commuters.<\/p> <p>I welcome the creation of a focus group by Newbridge Community Development within recent months to advocate for an extension, as I have said before in this House.  Indeed, I and colleagues have had numerous conversations with its spokesperson, Jennifer Caffrey, on sharing information and updates from the numerous times I have raised this matter in this House, and my colleagues have supported those calls in the Lower House while raising the same issue in their areas.<\/p> <p>The fact remains, as has been said many times today, that hard-pressed commuters bypass Newbridge and other Kildare stations and drive daily to Sallins station in Naas to avail of the short hop fares.  Who can blame them?  Many people who I still correspond with on this matter are saving up to &euro;200 a month by choosing to get into their cars each morning and drive past their local stations in favour of stopping at Sallins station and availing of the short hop zone fares.  The result, as anyone who uses the M7 will know, is that it has simply become a car park.  Most mornings, the traffic stops at Kill and commuters&rsquo; cars crawl all the way to Newlands Cross, a journey of ten minutes that is now taking 40 minutes-plus each morning.<\/p> <p>This is not just a commuter crisis; it is also a climate one.  I agree with the wording of the motion that it is necessary to incentivise greater use of public transport to meet the climate targets as set out in the climate action plan.  Currently, the cost is prohibiting many commuters who can use the trains to get to their work and appointments and they are using their cars instead, adding to emissions.  In August of this year, my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, received another reply from the NTA regarding his campaign for fare reductions towards Drogheda.  In one of the latest replies from the NTA, the CEO states the authority recognises there is a higher base fare outside the short hop zone.  The reply, like previous ones, states the work on examining what needs to be done is ongoing and the authority will be examining the fare forgone cost in an effort to introduce a more equitable system.  Most importantly, once again, the reply concludes by saying this will then be presented to the Government for funding at the next budgetary cycle.<\/p> <p>Before I finish, I support the calls by Senators Fiona O'Loughlin and Victor Boyhan about public toilets on the transport network.  We have all been contacted by commuters about train stations, particularly Newbridge, and it is not just the public toilets in Newbridge but also the infrastructure.  It has taken weeks for that to be solved.  It is unbelievable in this day and age that we do not have public toilets on our transport systems, for example, at Newbridge, and that is replicated in many more stations throughout south Kildare and on to Portarlington.<\/p> <p>In supporting this very important Private Members&rsquo; motion, I once again thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators for introducing it.  We need to be clear that the NTA has continually said it will not be moving to extend the short hop zone to the stations mentioned in this motion until it receives funding from Government.  That funding, of course, could be provided by the Government now.  I was told very recently - in fact, yesterday - that the NTA will have to act on getting its report ready faster and, more importantly, will have to reduce the fares if it is provided with such funding.  Those hard-pressed commuters I spoke about earlier need the funding to be provided.  The simple fact is that, as was shown in Mallow, if we reduce fares, commuters will use the trains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#AAA00700","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I am delighted the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is here because I think a Green Party Minister will actually make this happen.  I thank my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues for putting forward this motion, which is very important for many colleagues in this House.  I felt it was so important that, a number of weeks ago, I contacted Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour Party and all other Senators in this House who are affected by this motion to see if we could get together collaboratively and work to make this a tangible goal and make it happen.<\/p> <p>I welcome the motion.  The 50 km and 70 km zones look very pretty but I wonder if that is practical.  I would certainly be happy to see it happen but we are talking about hitting Carlingford with that, and a few more kilometres and the medium hop zone would actually be in the North of Ireland.  The Department should conduct research to see where the need really is for these services.  I know that Gormanstown in County Meath has the infrastructure to handle much higher use of train services, and the need is there too.  We could be stretching up as far as Laytown and I know that Newbridge down south would benefit greatly from being included in the short hop zone.<\/p> <p>The pricing structure must be right, however.  I know that many people travel to Balbriggan from counties Meath and Louth because of the fares.  A Dublin to Balbriggan return is &euro;8.90 whereas a Dublin to Drogheda return is &euro;19.50, which is 122% more.  Dublin to Gormanstown is &euro;15.10 and Dublin to Laytown is &euro;16.90 return.  If people are living in Meath, it costs 100% more in fares, and if they are living in Louth, it is 122% more, so it is practical to include these areas in the short hop zone.<\/p> <p>My colleague spoke earlier about Julianstown.  More than 25,000 cars pass through Julianstown every day, with most travelling to the train station in Balbriggan and with commuters parking in Balbriggan and getting the train there.  Some of them are parking up in Gormanstown and they are not parking in the car park there but along the side of the road, which is a problem for the residents living on the station road.  When I was on the council, the cost of public parking near these stations was a massive issue.  It is &euro;30 to &euro;35 per month and people cannot afford that on top of the fares.  It is something we need to look at and the price structure also needs to be looked at.  The Meath and Louth area would definitely welcome these short hop zone fares.<\/p> <p>There are other issues I want to raise.  The fact we do not have a train or tram from the airport into Dublin city centre is unbelievable.  It is ridiculous at this stage that, as a First World, European nation, we do not have a train or tram route from our national airport into our capital city.  It is a complete anomaly when we look at almost all other European capitals.  I understand no Government wants to do it because of the cost and because it will have to disrupt business, traffic and all of that, but, realistically, it should be done so a way around that must be found.<\/p> <p>I spoke earlier about parking charges at stations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Not everyone lives within walking distance of a station, so we should not be punishing people for driving to stations and using public transport.<\/p><p>Most people do not want to drive for 45 minutes or an hour, getting stuck in traffic on the way, in order to get to work.  They would love to take the train.  We need to encourage that.  We can do so by making public transport physically and financially accessible, safe and pleasant.  The fare reductions across public transport have been wonderful.  It will be interesting to see the data relating to that, and any increase in people using public transport.  I would love to see more innovative policies to make our public transport networks more attractive to users and prospective users.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is going to make them affordable, maybe it is the Green Party that will make them first class.  Exchequer funding would be well spent if that can be done.

That support seems to be pretty much cross-party in nature.  Other issues were raised during the debate, but, in framing this motion, I felt it was important to stick to one matter because public transport is so complex and there is so much we need to do, particularly in the context of connecting rural communities.  I really believe that extending the short hop zone and including a medium hop zone is important.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State stated that she is generally in agreement and that looking at fairer fares is really important.  I do not really care what this would be called.  It does not need to be called an extension of the short hop zone.  It could be called fairer fares, better transport or affordable transport.  The name does not matter; it is the principle that matters.  From what the Minister of State said, I feel the Government is in agreement with the principle of ensuring that the fare per kilometre is the same outside the short hop zone as inside it.  That is what we all want and that is key.<\/p> <p>I wish to respond to the Sinn F&eacute;in assertion that nothing for public transport was included in the budget.  It is significant that the Government extended the 50% student fare to 16-, 17- and 18-year-olds and full-time mature students in the budget.  This is something I fought hard for.  I have heard Senators state that it was most unfair that it just catered to 19- to 23-year-olds.  The extension of the 50% student fare and the 20% for everybody is significant.  As a result, it is unfair to say that public transport was not fairly treated in the context of the budget; it was.  Obviously, we can do more and we need to do more.  The fact that the NTA is examining fairer fares gives me hope.<\/p> <p>The reason I put in the medium hop zone is because simply by moving the radius to 50 km and leaving it there, which, apparently, is Fine Gael policy, just pushes the can to other areas and again, leaves councillors and public representatives on the fringes of those areas to start the fight all over again about extending it.  I felt that the creation of a medium hop zone between 50 km and 75 km was a logical accompaniment to that.  Obviously, if this is taken on board, the NTA would do its own research into it.<\/p> <p>A comment was made to the effect that I was looking at a certain part of the country.  I make no apology for that.  The areas within Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath are under significant pressure because they are beside the capital city with regard to jobs, etc.  Due to the cost of housing, many people have moved to our counties and, of course, they are very welcome.  From 1996 to 2016, Kildare experienced population growth of 64.8%.  During this period, the population in Newbridge grew by 189%.  That tells a significant story.  Newbridge is now home to more than 10% of the population of Kildare, with further population growth of 25% expected by 2026.  The population of the town has exploded with much of it due to people who moved to Newbridge because they could not afford to buy a house in Dublin.  They are returning to Dublin by car for work, so we need to ensure that we facilitate this type of public transport.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State is supportive of my motion because it does align with Green Party policy in terms of putting funding into public transport, taking people off the roads and ensuring that they do not have second cars.  In some instances, people may not need a car at all if they live close to public transport.  That is what we hope to achieve by this.  I am very heartened by the cross-party support for the motion.  This is Fianna F&aacute;il policy, and I hope to see it incorporated into Government policy very soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#BBB00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1667989800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#BBB00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1667989800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022110900002#BBB00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1667989800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar athl&oacute; ar 7.06 p.m. go dt&iacute; 10.30 a.m., D&eacute;ardaoin, 10 November 2022.<\/p><p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.06 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 November 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
