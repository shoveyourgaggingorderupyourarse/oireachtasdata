Along with her Cabinet colleagues, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has been working on our new national strategy to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, and it will be published within weeks.  The goal of zero tolerance of violence against women is clear.  The new strategy recognises, however, that this is a problem that can only be solved by all of society and the Government working together and it is not simply a criminal justice issue.  The new strategy will be structured around four pillars or goals: prevention, protection, prosecution and co-ordination of policies.<\/p> <p>The prevention goal, for example, involves working towards the eradication of the social and cultural norms - yes, among men - that underpin and contribute to gender-based violence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That means appropriate education from primary school up on healthy relationships, gender equality and consent.

Reforms are under way to ensure victims are treated with professionalism and sensitivity in every interaction with the criminal justice system.  We must also prosecute and punish the perpetrators who inflict suffering on so many women; again, our zero-tolerance approach to violence against women will be reflected in the law.  This new strategy is being developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out.<\/p><p>There is real determination across the Government, across the sector and, as we have seen in recent days, across society to bring about the change that we need to see.

Some of that has been unfair but some of it should also be taken on board.  The Minister of State will be aware that there has been criticism from other European jurisdictions and data protection authorities across Europe.

We know that this is just going to continue to grow.  A recent survey by McCann FitzGerald and Mazars found that businesses here were increasingly concerned about having to deal with issues of data protection and data privacy.  However, William Fry conducted a survey of international businesses recently in which 89% of respondents recognised that the regulatory climate in Ireland would be regarded as good to excellent.<br\/><br\/>However, there are problems.  The Minister of State acknowledged at the time that there were not sufficient staff in the Data Protection Commission.  In an interview in the <i>Business Post<\/i>on 5 December, the commissioner stated that the office is currently unsustainable and unfit for purpose.  We have the DPC already saying that the office is not sustainable in its current form.  There were commitments by Government which have not been sufficient to meet the scale of the challenge.<br\/><br\/>Given the importance of data privacy and data protection, particularly following the Schrems II judgment, it is of increasing importance that we take action against companies engaged in data breaches.  We must have a properly resourced and, more importantly, properly structured DPC.  The time is long overdue.  The Oireachtas justice committee recommended the following: that the Government appoint three data protection commissioners, as is provided for in legislation; that there be an independent review of the operation of the DPC to take on board criticisms and address concerns; and that we be in a position to give confidence that Ireland has an excellent data protection regime.  <br\/><br\/>One of the largest fines set down by the DPC was against WhatsApp.  Clearly the DPC is taking the issues very seriously.  On the other side, however, last year there were nearly 7,000 Irish citizens and individuals who made complaints to the DPC.  One of the complaints was about the length of time it is taking for the DPC to deal with some of those complaints.  I ask the Minister of State to set out the Government's position with regard to the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#D00600","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue which he has consistently raised in the House.  The programme for Government commits to recognise the domestic and international importance of data protection in Ireland and states that the Government will ensure that Ireland delivers on its responsibilities under the general data protection regulation.  The Government is very conscious of the commitment to deliver effective data protection regulation and protection of the data privacy rights of EU citizens, which is critical to the development and growth of our digital economy.  In dialogue with the Data Protection Commission and with other relevant Departments, the role of my Department is to ensure that the commission continues to have the resources required to fulfil its important statutory obligations.<\/p> <p>GDPR obliges member states to ensure that each supervisory authority is necessarily resourced to perform its tasks and exercise its powers.  To that effect, the DPC is one of the largest EU data protection authorities in terms of budget and staffing.  The DPC is funded under its own Vote as of 1 January 2020, with the commissioner being Accounting Officer.  It has received an allocation of &euro;23.2 million under budget 2022, a 22% increase on the &euro;19.1 million that was allocated for 2021.  This equates to a &euro;4.1 million increase in pay of &euro;3.2 million and non-pay of &euro;900,000.  Furthermore, the 2022 allocation marks a sixfold increase on its 2015 allocation.<\/p> <p>There have been significant increases over recent years.  Resources awarded to the DPC have risen steadily.

Section 15 states that \"the Commission shall consist of such and so many members (not being more than 3) as the Government determines\".  Section 16 provides that in the event of there being more than one commissioner, the Minister shall appoint one to be chairperson with a casting vote.  In keeping with the Government's commitments, and as conveyed to the D&aacute;il in a written reply in October 2021, Deputy Humphreys, then acting as Minister for Justice, requested officials of the Department to consider the matter of appointing additional commissioners to the DPC.  This was done on the basis that if such a recommendation were to be made, it would require the Minister to bring a recommendation to the Government for decision.

The Leas-Chathaoirleach and I sit on the Special Seanad Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU.

We have had some discussion about this issue, if not a great deal.  I have also received a substantial amount of correspondence from growers and farmers, and especially from Donegal.  As the Minister will be aware, it is an important county for the production of potatoes, and specifically of seed potatoes.  In the next few weeks, I intend to travel to Raphoe to see such an operation.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of it.<\/p><p>I also speak about this issue in the context of the national agrifood sector and the strategy in that regard, including the horticulture strategy, as well as rural development, rural communities and the rural economy.  I refer to all those issues together because I do not think they can be separated.  The Minister and I know the potato industry is facing a potential crisis.  If we do not resolve the issues concerning seed potatoes, then we are going to have problems.  To give some background information, and the Minister will know this, approximately 9,000 ha of seed potatoes are planted in Ireland every year, requiring approximately 20,000 tonnes of seed potatoes.  These are sourced from certified home-grown, imported and farm-saved seeds.  The main varieties of potatoes produced here are Roosters, followed by Kerrs Pinks, Maris Pipers, Queens, Records and Golden Wonders, to name just a few.  <\/p><p>It is a significant industry, and one that we should be ambitious about and endeavouring to grow.  My focus in asking the Minister about this matter today is on the fallout from Brexit.  As a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU and to end the Brexit transition period from 1 January 2021, the import of seed potatoes from Great Britain into the EU is now prohibited.  That is a fact.  The UK applied to the EU for third-party equivalence for the export of certified seed potatoes, but the EU refused the application because the UK's plant health regulations are \"not dynamically aligned with the EU&rsquo;s legislation\".  This means that the main concern for potato growers now centres on the supply of seed potatoes.<\/p><p>Having gleaned information from correspondence that I have seen from the Secretary General of the Minister's Department, I understand that the Department will actively and significantly support the production of the mini-tubers through the Tops potato propagation centre in Raphoe in County Donegal and others.  I also understand that all necessary resources will be supplied by the Minister's Department to ensure that an adequate supply of mini-tubers is made available to the industry.  I would like to hear a little bit about that aspect. <\/p><p>Returning to the key issue, there is a question about the supply of seed potatoes.  What do farmers want?  They want certainty, and they want it now.  This is the time when they are planning their sowing schedules.  This concerns the agrifood sector, and involves supporting the horticultural sector, the Irish brand potato and rural communities.  Ultimately, in the broader perspective, we need a bigger strategy for the coming years to enable us to develop our own seed potential and our own seed production industry and to grow it.  I am not happy enough, and neither I think is the Minister, for us to just sustain our current level of growth and investment in this area.  We want to grow this industry as a part of the food sector on this green island of Ireland.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#F00500","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  He is a strong proponent of the seed potato sector.  It is one with great potential, and I am committed to seeing it growing again and being restored to its heyday.  This endeavour must be led by the industry, with support from my Department.  As a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU and following the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January 2021, the import of seed potatoes from Britain into the EU has been prohibited under EU plant health regulations.  These regulations apply to all EU member states, where it is now illegal to import seed potatoes from Great Britain for seed propagation purposes.<\/p> <p>The UK applied to the EU for recognition of equivalence under Article 44 of the EU plant health regulations to allow for the export of certified seed potatoes from Great Britain to the EU to continue post-transition.  The EU, however, refused this application because the UK's plant health regulations are \"not dynamically aligned to EU's [phytosanitary] legislation\".  Traditionally, there has been a strong demand and requirement in Ireland for high-grade seed potatoes from Great Britain.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In recognition of this, my Department has actively engaged with the European Commission and other member states at various EU meetings on exports of seed potatoes from Britain, including at the EU chief officer of plant health meetings and the EU standing committee meetings on plant health, among others.  At these meetings my Department has continually outlined to the Commission our view that there should be continued free movement of seed potatoes between Great Britain and Ireland.  We have urged the European Commission to engage to find a solution to the resumption of this trade and have suggested that this could be achieved either by discussing equivalence under Article 44 of the plant health regulation or by way of a derogation.  Exports of seed potatoes from Britain to Northern Ireland and the EU have also been discussed at the first meeting of the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and at the European Parliament environment committee.  In all forums the Commission has maintained its position that the UK's plant health regulations must be dynamically aligned to that of the EU for any resumption of trade to take place.<\/p><p>I am keen to highlight to the Senator that the ending of high-grade seed imports from Britain provides a real opportunity for the revival of domestic seed production, a point he dwelled on in his contribution.  An all-island plant health status, seed growing tradition and the potential to form producer organisations by potato growers are all positives.  There is an increased interest from major seed potato contractors in placing contracts for seed with Irish growers in the wake of Brexit.  My Department will offer as much support as possible in developing the seed potato sector.  However, further expansion of the seed area must be industry led.  This expansion should be assisted in the coming years by the availability of seed of our main variety, Rooster, whose plant breeder's rights expired at the end of 2021.<\/p><p>My Department actively supports the production of mini-tubers through the Tops Potato Centre, in Raphoe, in my county, whose good work Senator Boyhan referred to in strong terms.

It is important that this is industry led, and that those who need to purchase seed for growing ware potato engage with growers that are willing to grow more seed potato and provide certainty to them that if they produce a quality seed potato product that they will be purchased.  That is within our grasp and that of the industry, and I will work closely with industry.  I will meet the IFA potato committee in the next number of days, following the meetings I had with it last year to try to further advocate that we grasp this potential.  Alongside that, I will continue to advocate at European level for free movement.

As he knows, there is an ongoing housing emergency throughout the State.  I want to focus in particular on Limerick city and county.  I will set the scene with a few factual statistics.  We currently have 2,342 approved applications for housing.  In addition, we have 335 transfer applications, 2,479 people on housing assistance payments and 735 on the rental assistance scheme.  That gives us a total of 5,891 people on the housing list as of last September, a truly shocking total that does not fully demonstrate the extent of the housing crisis in Limerick because, as I hope the Minister of State will acknowledge, thousands more are excluded from qualifying for public housing because of the ridiculously low income threshold still in place under this Government.<\/p> <p>As of November last, there were 246 homeless people in Limerick and 46 families homeless in the mid-west, comprising 56 adults and 77 children.  The Minister of State will know that hubs in Limerick have been full for the majority of the past 12 months.  There were no temporary emergency provision beds available in Limerick in November and, as far as I am aware, none have come online since.  There has been no major turnaround in the number of people using temporary emergency provision services, which is contrary to the meaning of the word \"temporary\".  The majority of those who are homeless are aged between 25 and 44 years.  There are two issues.  In most cases, they are not seen as a priority because they do not have children.  Second, they are being priced out of the market by excessive rents.  The average price for a one-bedroom apartment in Limerick city is now &euro;999 per month.  The average price for a three-bedroom house is now &euro;1,277, an increase of 8% over the past year.  The average cost of renting a single room in Limerick city centre is now &euro;464, up a shocking 21% on a year ago.<\/p> <p>It is against the backdrop of this crisis, insecurity and desperation that I have to ask the Minister of State how, according to the figures available which were highlighted by a Sunday newspaper at the weekend, there are 207 vacant council properties in Limerick?  Is that the correct figure?  I would appreciate clarification, because the last official figures I have state that there were 297 vacant properties in April this year.  According to Limerick City and County Council, of those 73 required minor fixes, 102 required major fixes and 72 were considered derelict.  How can the Government's priorities be so skewed as to have this many empty council properties at a time when we have an emergency crisis of the most unprecedented kind?  <\/p> <p>I understand that Limerick City and County Council is currently leasing 164 properties from vulture funds that, thanks to this Government, will collect rent tax free for the next 25 years.  At the end of that period, not one single property will transfer into local authority ownership.  Again, I have to ask the Minister of State about the Government's priorities.  Why is it choosing to fund the leasing of homes from vulture funds rather than repairing and restoring council-owned houses?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This means that right now more money is being pumped into an overheated private sector housing market rather than pumping it into council-owned properties that could provide rental income for Limerick City and County Council.  The people of Limerick are genuinely wondering why we have so many vacant council properties in the midst of the worst housing crisis in the record of the State.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to provide some answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#J00300","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach agus leis an Seanad&oacute;ir, agus athbhliain faoi mhaise daoibh go l&eacute;ir.  I might not be able to answer all of the questions the Senator has put to me.  I have taken a note of them and I will try to get to him with some of the responses.  I will address the overall issue of vacancy in Limerick, which is the core issue.  Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary objective of the Government, as demonstrated by one of the four pathways dedicated solely to this priority area in the new Housing for All strategy.<\/p> <p>Housing for All outlines a suite of measures aimed at addressing vacancy in a co-ordinated and robust manner.  These include a new local authority-led programme to help local authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns initiative will attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties in small towns and villages.  A new town centre first policy, which will be launched in a number of weeks, will include approaches to utilising existing stock.  These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax consideration being pursued by the Department of Finance as a replacement for the vacant site levy.<\/p> <p>With regard to voids, the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, the implementation of a planned maintenance programme and carrying out responsive repairs, are matters for each individual local authority under section 28 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provision) Act 2009.  Since 2014, Exchequer funding has been provided through the Department's voids programme to support local authorities in preparing vacant units for re-letting.  This funding was introduced to tackle long-term vacant units and is now targeting local authorities to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock.  Limerick City and County Council received &euro;7.6 million in funding from 2014 to 2021, supporting the return of 505 properties to use.  This might explain the disparity in figures the Senator provided.  Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock.  This will fluctuate over time, as tenancy surrender and re-letting of stock is an ongoing process.<\/p> <p>The Department has been providing support for an ambitious regeneration project in Limerick city since 2007, with a cumulative investment of more than &euro;417 million to date.  The Limerick regeneration framework implementation plan adopted by the council in 2014 provided a roadmap for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the target areas.  It proposed the refurbishment of more than 1,400 existing social and private houses.  More than 1,100 refurbishments have been completed to date under the thermal upgrade programme.  These actions, along with investment in social, economic and physical regeneration being implemented under the Limerick regeneration framework implementation plan are making a real difference to the communities in the regeneration area.  The buy and renew scheme along with the repair and leasing scheme are also valuable tools available to local authorities to tackle vacancy and provide social housing.<\/p> <p>With regard to leasing, as the Senator will be aware, Housing for All sets out the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade.  The annual targets include the delivery of 88,400 new social homes and 53,800 new affordable homes between 2022 and 2030.  Thankfully, we have seen construction activity ramping up over the course of 2021 and this will continue this year.  The strategy will focus strongly on new builds, and in particular local authority-led new build activity.  It will see a managed phasing out of long-term leasing by 2025.  The Senator addressed this issue.  Limerick has no long-term leasing target under Housing for All but it was recently allocated a 2022 target of 21 short-term rental availability agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#K00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The facts of regeneration are that more than 1,100 houses have been demolished and only 279 new houses have been built.  That is a huge deficit and, again, shows a failure to deliver housing in Limerick.<\/p><p>Finally, the Minister of State did not give me any answers about leasing, yet he will acknowledge that 2,600 of the planned social houses next year are actually leasing houses.

There are solutions, and we can look at Limerick city centre as we are looking throughout the country, around above shop premises and bringing some shop premises back to full occupancy.  These premises offer great opportunities to young people in that category.  We can advance that through the town centres first initiative and the Limerick regeneration project.<\/p> <p>In terms of 60 properties per year, it does take a considerable amount of time to bring voids back into productive use if you specifically consider the requirements under building regulations and trying to bring houses up to a B2 rating, which is soon to be a much higher energy efficiency standard.

We certainly are not putting the blame on Limerick City and County Council.  We are giving increased responsibility and financial supports.  What the Minister has done consistently since taking up office is providing the financial resources but also the responsibility to local authorities to deliver on housing and a targeted delivery of housing.

We have seen that future risks of flooding have increased because of a whole variety of things, with climate change being just one of them.  Dundalk and Blackrock are areas of natural low lying topography.  Such areas are an issue because they call for a much more sensitive approach to be adopted in flood relief schemes and the type of construction necessary.  For example, the proposed flood relief scheme for both Dundalk and Blackrock south consists of the construction of a series of hard defences, including flood embankments, walls, rock armour, coastal protection, barriers, road raising and the tanking of two properties.

A greenway along this area would be very important for tourism, but it will not happen until this project is brought to a certain level.

I am aware of the impact of flooding on homeowners, businesses and communities in the area.<\/p> <p>Through the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, flood programme, a detailed engineering analysis assessment and extensive public consultation were undertaken for over 300 communities throughout the country, including 90 coastal areas which include the eastern part of County Louth.

The evidence provided by the CFRAM programme was launched in 2018 and supports the Government's &euro;1.3 billion investment programme.  It is delivered through the national development plan.  A total of 118 flood relief projects were identified to protect the main flood risk areas throughout the country.  These include the proposed schemes for County Louth, which are Dundalk, Blackrock south, Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee.  Louth County Council, working with the Office of Public Works, has agreed to be the lead authority in the delivery of these schemes.  The council chairs each project steering group, which includes the Office of Public Works and local authority representatives.<\/p> <p>The Dundalk, Blackrock south and Ardee projects that are being progressed simultaneously were chosen by the council as the first projects to be advanced in County Louth.  The CFRAM proposed flood relief scheme for Dundalk-Blackrock south would consist of the construction of a series of hard defences, including embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, raising the road, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties.  The proposed measure for Ardee consists of flood embankments and walls at an average height of 0.8 m and a total length of approximately 600 m.  Both schemes will provide the protection required by the insurance industry and will be adaptable for future climate change scenarios.<\/p> <p>The development of the flood relief schemes involve five distinct sequential and related stages.  The stages involve assessing the flood risk and identifying options, planning, detailed design, construction and maintenance.  Where it is possible, the project management of scheme delivery involves running some of the stages in parallel to expedite delivery, such as detailed design when planning permission is being sought.  The cost for the Dundalk and Ardee schemes is approximately &euro;80.9 million.  The tender for the engineering consultancy services for the project was awarded to Binnies, formerly Black and Veatch, and Nicholas O'Dwyer as a joint venture in 2020.  The proposed flood relief schemes for these areas will protect 1,880 properties when completed, 1,705 residential and 175 commercial.  These are enormous schemes.<\/p> <p>Currently, the Dundalk-Blackrock south and Ardee schemes project is at stage 1.  This includes the collation of hydrology and hydraulics, the development of an options report for the preferred and viable scheme, and the preparation of associated environmental considerations as set out in the environmental impact assessment report.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The steering group for the project meets monthly and the scheme development is ongoing, with work progressing on surveys on hydrology and hydraulics report schemes options and environmental assessments.

It will enable walkers and cyclists to travel off-road between Belfast and Dublin.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I have been keen to progress the usage of embankments for purposes other than flood relief.

I say that in the context of good news today from Cork city, where we have finally jumped a huge hurdle in the context of Morrison's Island.  I wish Louth County Council, which is the lead agency, the very best of luck in the delivery of this project without interruption.  Let us hope there will not be unnecessary interruption, particularly at planning stag.  The people of Dundalk, Blackrock south, Ardee, Drogheda, Greenore, Baltray and many other places in County Louth are waiting for flood relief that is very important in that part of the country because sea levels are rising.  This is a big threat.  As I have stated previously in the House, the greatest threat to this country in the short and medium term is not from any kind of invading force; it is actually from the sea.  We need to take that seriously.  Unfortunately, there are people in the political sphere who do not wish to take it seriously and think we can just row our boat along and everything will be fine, and we will all go up to the High Court for judicial reviews and challenges and everything like that.  In the meantime, the flood waters continue to rise and people's houses, businesses and lives continue to be destroyed.  They cannot get insurance.

These students have been severely impacted by the Covid pandemic.  There is no doubt that the continuous negative strain Covid has had on so many students is too significant to ignore.  In the past week and a half, since we came back after Christmas, my office has been inundated with students who tell me about their lives as a result of Covid and how their mental health has been severely impacted by the strain of the past 22 months and, in particular, the unpredictability of the current climate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have described to me how hard the past 22 months have been and how new restrictions, new cases and being identified as a close contact have increased the burden they all feel.  They have missed so much work in class and so many social experiences.  Even the peer support they receive from each other has not been available to them because we have been asking them to stay away from each other.  They have very much adhered to that and to the request to stay at home.  Their social lives have been entirely disrupted, whether they involve school breaks and lunches or activities outside school.  They have undoubtedly suffered.  While we say that schooldays are the best days of our lives - as an older lady, I can now probably look back with nostalgia - the doom and gloom of the past couple of years have certainly overshadowed our young students' lives.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and appreciate that allowances were made last August to reflect the changes and the challenges faced by the students.  I am absolutely sure students acknowledge them also, but we really do not believe they are anywhere near enough.  A decision was made to grant last year's students the hybrid model to give them the option of sitting the exams. I absolutely believe they should sit them and hope it will be safe for them to do so.  The option of receiving accredited grades came as such a relief to most students last year.  It is absolutely the safety valve that we need to provide students with this year.  To me, the hybrid model is a really compassionate one.  Compassion is what our students absolutely need now.<\/p><p>We will continue to talk about the reform of an outdated education system, involving the sitting a series of rigid and seemingly future-defining exams, because I really do believe there are more lenient models we can put in place, but the immediate focus has to be on the well-being of the young people outside Leinster House today.  I say this not just because I have spoken to them, their parents and teachers for the past couple of weeks but because I have a student living in my house.  This is the second person in my house who will have done the leaving certificate under Covid.  I can genuinely tell the Minister that the man I have at home has gone through a far more stressful experience than his older sister.  It is incumbent on us to recognise the unprecedented crisis and the consequences for students every single day, in addition to the stress they are currently experiencing.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the Minister is having a stakeholders' meeting tomorrow.  I welcome that because the decisions arising from it will give the students certainty.  I ask her to consider the stress experienced by students and their well-being and allow them to have the stress-release valve of sitting the exams this year while also having accredited grades.  Thus, they can commit and focus for the next couple of months knowing that a safety valve exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#N00400","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and allowing me the opportunity to address it.

By moving these examinations to the Easter holidays, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning, especially for those candidates preparing for their examinations, as this change will limit teacher absence from schools.<\/p><p>The SEC also recently provided some further information to schools regarding aspects of the 2022 State examinations.  This included postponing commencement of assessment of what are known as the leaving certificate applied February tasks, from 31 January to 14 February.  Schools were also reminded of the flexibility that is available regarding the dates for completion and authentication of course work for leaving certificate candidates.<\/p><p>I also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  This will be for students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness.<\/p><p>Finally, the Department has also provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils in a Covid-19 context.

I do not say this to be critical, because obviously every decision we make as a State, and indeed the decisions all our teachers make in this regard, are to try to provide the safest and best environment where children can continue to learn and so as not to learn remotely as we had to do the previous year.<\/p> <p>Only before Christmas the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI,  called for a delay in the return to school of our students and teachers until a short week-and-a-half ago.

This jars with the fact the TUI is now saying we should carry on as normal and do the exams, as if the past 22 months had not happened for the students.  Of students surveyed by the Irish Second-level Students' Union, ISSU, last week, 68% said they wanted the hybrid model.  They spoke about their stress levels, their well-being and their fears.

Insurance is a very big part of that cost.  I was contacted yesterday by a young couple who finally bought their house and are due to get married.  They did everything properly and evaluated their house before purchase so there could be no issue with it.  Unfortunately, there was storm damage to the roof and they put in a claim to Aviva insurance, which is a very reputable company.  They have now been told it is not the insurance company's problem and this couple will have to rectify it by themselves.  They will have to pay another &euro;6,000 on top of already excessive insurance and mortgage payments.

There have been some important conversations in this country over the past few days, some of which have been helpful, insightful and constructive, although others were less so.

We must do all we can to make this country a safe place for women and children.<\/p> <p>As we talked about this over the past few days, I have thought about how we would not know anything about this tragedy if it had not been reported.

I have spoken many times in this House about the problem of abuse and violence, whether it is domestic, gender-based, against children or in any other form.

National services in the form of Women's Aid, Safe Ireland and many others are there to help because nobody should have to live in fear.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, we can say that 2021 was a year of fear.  It was characterised by headline after headline from the media and announcement after announcement from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the Government of worst-case scenarios.  There was modelling and subsequent delivery of massively inflated death tolls and hospitalisation numbers.  There were incessant doomsday predictions being given non-stop airtime by major broadcasters.  Even as early data came from South Africa and preliminary medical papers were made publicly available by the University of Hong Kong on the key differences of the Omicron variant, NPHET insisted on the reintroduction of restrictions over the Christmas period, which were to be lifted, in the words of one Minister, \"if our worst fears do not come to pass\".

Consent is something that we speak about an awful lot and the proper kind of educational reforms that are required around consent.

It was chaired by Senator Flynn.  It really brought home to me the lives that children are leading in their homes.  There is an awful lot we need to do on accommodation.  When it comes to the kind of experiences they have in their school life, however, there is almost no place to go that is comfortable and where people are shown respect.  The councils are not showing respect when it comes to proper accommodation.  In our schools, 27% of Traveller parents say that their children experience identity-based bullying.<\/p> <p>I note the Yellow Flag programme.  It has real difficulty in getting funding.  It relies on funding from local authorities, provided on a case-by-case basis depending on whether the local authority has funds in the pot and whether it is willing to support it.  Most of the education is in schools where there are a lot of people coming from diverse backgrounds.  We need to see it being rolled out across the board in all schools if we are really to tackle the issues of identity-based violence and bullying.  Some 150 schools are turned away each year from this programme because the funding is not there.

Violence against women is endemic and for many years has been systemic in our society and in Irish life.  It is something that we need to work on hard to bring to an end.<\/p> <p>Like Senator O'Loughlin, I note the announcement from Government of the payment for healthcare workers.  We probably need a more comprehensive input from Government and it would be useful if we could have statements detailing which healthcare workers will qualify for this payment.  It is also a timely reminder that we need to invest further in our health services.  We need to meet the needs of workers across that sector, Covid or no Covid.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ultimately, what we need is an Irish national health service.

The report examined 19 murders, including those of elected representatives in this jurisdiction, who were targeted and assassinated by the Ulster Defence Association, UDA,  with the active assistance of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC.  The ombudsman said that she was numbed by the level and the extent of collusion involved.  We know that the report, as serious and comprehensive as it is, is but a snapshot of a wider malign policy that was at play.  Given the particular ramifications for political leaders in this State, I think it warrants statements.  I appreciate we recently had statements on legacy issues which were challenging and ultimately worthwhile.  This report gives us a particular snapshot of the issue and warrants discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#V00200","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Like others, I wish to express my sympathies on the murder of Ashling Murphy.  For many women, it is difficult to open a newspaper or watch television any day and not see an act of violence against them.  We rationalise those things to psychologically protect ourselves.  Every once in a while, a murder happens and it strikes a chord with everybody.  We ask how we can possibly protect ourselves.  Ashling Murphy was going for a run in the daylight at 4 p.m. in her home town, in what seemed like a safe space.  When something like that happens, we all feel the foundations of what we consider to be safety and build up around ourselves, and the strategies that we have.  Every time a woman leaves the house, she will risk assess.  I have really enjoyed being able to come to work on the bike for the past few weeks, but as soon as we move to late sittings, I will switch back to using the car.  That is a conscious decision that I make every day when I come in.  I decide how I am going to get myself to places safely.  We all do that.<\/p> <p>I wish mention the Mongolian national, Urantsetseg Tserendorj.  In January 2021, she was walking home from her cleaning job in Google, was attacked and died in the Mater Hospital two weeks later.  I remember being very shaken at the time by that murder.  I am from the inner city and I walk around the area a lot.  It was around the same time that the murder of Sarah Everard happened in the UK.  It was a senseless act.  A woman was walking home from a job, then lost her life two weeks later. <\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area that the National Transport Authority, NTA, has been consulting on.  I have raised the issue previously in the House.  While it is very much welcome, one glaring omission from the DART+ proposals is a station at Kylemore.  There is also an issue with the extension of BusConnects.  It comes back to safety.  There are a number of children who are coming from Chapelizod and getting the bus to Lucan.  They now do not have steps to be able to get to the bus safely.  There is no proposed station at Kylemore.  It beggars belief for me that we can have massive projects like BusConnects and DART Dublin south-west, yet the dots are not connected when it comes to putting in place that transport infrastructure for communities.  Currently, the NTA is negotiating with residents in lower Ballyfermot on getting access to the back of their properties to facilitate the DART extension.  That is absolutely fine.  However, there is no joined-up thinking about having a station in that big area in south-west Dublin, which is one of the most economically disadvantaged in the country.  The next station is in Maynooth.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will continue to raise this issue on the Order of Business until the NTA and Minister begin to listen regarding the need to provide services for the huge population in west Dublin.

I thank all Senators, and especially Senator Clifford-Lee, for their support.  I also thank the members of my Civil Engagement Group for all their support as well during the past four months.<\/p> <p>Last week, I was struck by comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, when she was talking to Miriam O'Callaghan on \"Prime Time\".  She said primary and secondary schools have education programmes dealing with consent around sexual violence and the root causes of rape.  I met with representatives of the Donegal Rape Crisis Centre last week.  I stress that it has little to no funds available now.  The centre has no funds to deliver an education programme to 200 students.  Last year, it was possible for the centre to deliver the programme to more than 100 students.  This year, though, the organisation does not have, as my father would say, a shilling in its account to enable it to deliver this great training programme to the young students.  Schools are crying out for the programme, so I suggest that we write a letter to the Minister for Education to ask if it would be possible to support the Donegal Rape Crisis Centre in delivering this vital training to the young people of the county.  <\/p> <p>I would also like to echo Senator Pauline O'Reilly's call for funding for the Yellow Flag programme.  It is a critical programme to have operating in our education system.  Prevention is better than intervention.  We must educate our young people to understand that racism, discrimination and the bullying of other children because they are different and not the same as others in the class is inappropriate.  The only way we can do that is through initiatives such as the Yellow Flag programme.  I have worked with the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, and the Yellow Flag programme for years.  It works, and I call for every school in the country to have access to the programme, just as they do to the Green Flag programme.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the critical issue of Traveller mental health.  Again, the figures in this regard are not just figures; they represent the experience of people's lives.  One in every 11 deaths in the Traveller community is caused by suicide.  Men in the Traveller community are seven times more likely to die by suicide than men in the general population, while women in the Traveller community are six times more likely to die by suicide than women in the general population.  We have a mental health crisis in our community.  It is tough for people to hear about this issue, but it is even tougher for me to talk about it.  When I open my front door in the Labre Park halting site, where I am living at the moment, I see young men and women in real need of support.  Over the Christmas break, on social media posts and elsewhere, we saw reports of young girls aged 12 dying by suicide in the Traveller community.  This needs to end.  <\/p> <p>It is not up to me, as an individual Oireachtas Member, to always come in here and take responsibility for raising this issue.  It is not fair to pigeonhole one person in that way.  Therefore, I ask everyone here to support a request for the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health issues, Deputy Butler, to come in and speak to us all about this issue.  We must all share responsibility for dealing with this issue.  The more collective we are in our efforts, the more action that can be undertaken to help the Traveller community.  We must explore what can be put in place to help young Travellers and to stop deaths by suicide happening within the Traveller community as much as we can.  Again, the national Traveller mental health network has worked non-stop on this issue.  It has all the answers, and all we need now is implementation.  Therefore, I reiterate my call for the Minister of State to come into the House, and it should not just be for an exchange between the two of us for four minutes.  There should be collective engagement by all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#X00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#X00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Well put.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#X00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Many sheep farmers across the country have had the horrendous experience of finding their animals, be they cattle or sheep, savaged by stray dogs.  Figures recorded from 2020 show that there were 241 such instances, but farmers are of the firm belief that the true figures are much greater and that there is an awful lot of non-reporting because farmers are not convinced that the authorities are taking this seriously.  Farmers provide full traceability for 7 million cattle and 3 million breeding sheep, whereby every single animal is individually tagged and traceable to the person responsible or the owner.  Contrast that with an estimated 800,000 dogs in this country, of which only 208,000 are licensed.  That leaves 600,000 without identification.  In 2020 there were only 82 prosecutions and 198 dogs were seized under the Control of Dogs Act 1986.  These figures indicate how serious a problem we have.  Farmers are very frustrated that the authorities are taking a very lax attitude to this problem.  Owning a dog, as we all know, is a responsibility that needs to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately, many dog owners do not do that.  The dogs need to be properly microchipped and ID'd.  We need proper and appropriate sanctions for those owners found to be non-compliant and to allow their dogs to stray.  We also need the proper resources to help those who are enforcing the law in this regard.<\/p> <p>We are now entering what is traditionally the lambing season.

I read the first ten pages of the report; I hope to read the rest of it this evening.  It shows how Ireland's abundant wind energy resources could produce vast quantities of green hydrogen.  This can be used to reduce significantly our dependence on imported fossil fuels, which caused a lot of significant energy spikes throughout 2021, which we discussed in this House.<\/p> <p>The report also sets out how green hydrogen has emerged as a leading option for reducing emissions to decarbonise sectors of the economy.  The report calls on the Government to do two things, and I ask for a debate on them.  They are, first, to make sure we release a robust hydrogen strategy in quarter 2 of 2022 and, second, to establish a high-level, cross-government group to develop recommendations to cut the price of renewable electricity so we can produce green hydrogen as cheaply and as quickly as possible.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is doing a lot of work in this regard.

Some journalists spend more time speculating and trying to influence what might happen rather than reporting what does happen.  Finally, the Cabinet will look to meet.

Even if it is incorporeal, it is important there is an immediate Cabinet meeting upon the production of the NPHET letter.  We have a reasonable idea of what is going to happen.

Twitter offers users the ability to report abusive messages or messages that contravene what the company describes as the Twitter rules.

Apparently this means it is okay to call people corrupt, describe them as cockroaches and put them into classes of people who do all kinds of awful things.  On the one hand Twitter tells us it is serious about this and on the other hand it pays scant regard to politicians, in particular, because I doubt there is a Member of this House, the D&aacute;il or local authorities throughout the country who has not received such a message.  Essentially, Twitter states it does not care and it does not matter, and that people can say what they like on social media because politicians do not matter.  I suspect this is true of many other groups of people, from schoolchildren to elderly people.  The Chamber has an opportunity to send a message to Twitter and other social media platforms, and I hope legislation will come forward this year in this regard, that it will not be acceptable to have so-called rules that mean absolutely nothing because they are never enforced.

It only perpetuates stigma and harm on drug users.<\/p><p>The Government has declared it is taking a health-led approach to drugs, but what I heard today at the committee did not instil much confidence that this is true.  For the record, I am a harm reductionist, if that is the terminology we can use.  I believe it is the only practical, realistic, person-centred approach we can take to drugs.  The international evidence also supports this.  In addition, in the committee there was a great deal of conflation of decriminalising and legalising drugs.  If we are to have a mature, well-informed discussion on this topic, which I believe the public wants, and there are calls for a citizens' assembly on this issue, the least we can do is understand what we are talking about.  I urge Members to get informed on the terminology, to put preconceived notions about drug users to the back of their minds and to engage with the evidence on how we can truly reduce drug-related harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#BB00300","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I send my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of, and everybody who loved, Ashling Murphy, and indeed to all the women who we have lost and whose lives have been stolen in this country and across the world.  We know lives have been taken, lives have been destroyed and lives have been threatened continuously in this country.  We speak about it in this Chamber quite often.  I and other colleagues have been raising gender abuse, abuse, sexual harassment and sexual assault continuously for months and years in this Chamber.  I was told on the radio the other morning that women should start speaking up about it.  I told the presenter that men and people should start listening and that changes have to start happening.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about people changing their routes when running.  A woman was assaulted on a route at home where I used to run.  I have not run there since then because I am afraid.  I look behind me constantly when I run.  I look behind more now when I am running or out and about.  It is not right.  We are exhausted with it.  It is just relentless.  Every day of the week one can look at the headlines about girls being assaulted, and the sentencing in some cases is absolutely incomparable to the damage done to women.<\/p> <p>This is a day of celebration for mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.  I am very glad it is a Louth woman, St. Brigid, who was born in Faughart.  Remember that this woman gouged out her eyes to make herself ugly because she did not want unwanted attention from men.  On the day that we remember St. Brigid and revel in her strength and mightiness and how proud we are to have her as our patron saint, remember what she did to get rid of unwanted attention from men.  I applaud her, although I do not agree with it.  However, that is what she did in the fifth century.  Go on, Brigid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#CC00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I echo what Senator Hoey said about the health committee meeting.  I had to turn off the camera at one stage as I thought I was going to have a panic attack.  I thought I had been hurled through time, given everything I have stood for in this Chamber over the last six years and hoped that people were listening to me.  I felt very disheartened and sad.  I thought: \"What is the point in me constantly speaking about this issue?\" when I listened to the Minister of State, who is now two years into the role.  I believe my 14-year-old could have engaged better on the issue in the health committee meeting today.  I am absolutely appalled that this is where we are, two years into his term of office.<\/p> <p>However, that is not the reason I stand to speak today.  We have had many conversations over the years about the impacts of Covid-19 on people, schools, education and the health sector, but we have had very little discussion about its impact on those in the prison system.  I do a lot of work on education in schools in the prison system.  When we think about education we do not think about education within the institutions where we detain people.  People there do not have access to their families, as they usually would.  At home, we can have telephone calls, we can have FaceTime meetings and we can talk to our loved ones when we have to go into isolation.  However, when one is in a prison, one is in a prison within a prison within a prison because one will be locked down for up to 12 or 14 days for being a close contact.  We also have not set up the health system properly in the prison system to be able to offer vaccinations adequately on intake in terms of the COVAX system.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A prisoner in Mountjoy wrote to me.  He lost one of his jobs within the prison because he would have to shave his beard to be able to use the masks that are now required to be worn.  For some people, it is a big deal to be asked to shave their beard.  That could be for religious or cultural reasons, but it could also be that the person feels vulnerable.  Facial hair for men can sometimes be far more than something they think looks well; it can be a way to hide themselves and hold themselves.  There is a significant amount happening within the prison system.  In fairness to the Irish Prison Service, it is trying to deal with this issue in the context of what is already quite a difficult situation in terms of outbreaks.  I ask the Leader to consider facilitating a debate on the impact of Covid-19 on those in prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022011900002#CC00300","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642602600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Like other Members, I join with colleagues in expressing my sympathies to the family of the late Ashling Murphy, but also to her peers and former lecturers at Mary Immaculate College.

It was lovely that everybody paid tribute and gave their thoughts in a very positive way.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of a hybrid leaving certificate.  I know the Leader tabled a Commencement matter with the Minister, Deputy Foley, on this issue earlier today.  I have received many calls and other communications from students who are under severe stress.  We all talk about well-being and mindfulness.  Many students feel very under pressure and do not know what is happening.  They want a hybrid leaving certificate because they believe that although they may have had a lot more time in class than leaving certificate students in the previous two years had, they still have not had the same degree of in-class schooling that other students had before the pandemic.  I know the committee will meet tomorrow but I ask the Leader to consider giving her support to contacting the Minister, Deputy Foley, on this issue.<\/p> <p>Family Carers Ireland has today called on the Government to recognise carers in terms of the Covid bonus.

The manner in which she died was brutal and horrific.  There are societal challenges and issues that need to be dealt with.  This Chamber needs to lead in terms of the conversations that need to happen, but also the actions that need to be taken.  That is important.  It is all very well talking about it and expressing shock and so on, but we actually need to deal with it and take action on it.  I look forward to the debate next week and a timeline for actions.  Those of us who have the privilege of being Members of Parliament have an absolute responsibility to actually lead on this and ensure we can make Ireland a safe place.  I truly believe we can do so, but it will require all of us, particularly men, to stand up, do the right thing, call out and take action.  I look forward to that debate.<\/p> <p>A neighbour of mine who lived five minutes down the road from me was killed in a plane crash.  He worked with the UN food programme.
