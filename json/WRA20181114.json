The active management of these lands and the wider publicly owned land bank is one of a range of complementary actions being progressed under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and the recently established Land Development Agency will play an important role in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  To date, State-led residential construction has focused primarily on helping to meet the needs of households in the lowest income brackets, through the social housing programme. With increased investment to deliver over 50,000 new social homes over the period 2016 to 2021, some 33,500 of which will be delivered through build programmes, the social housing construction programme has increased significantly in recent years.

This was considered to be in the best strategic interests of the water services and gas networks businesses and would enhance the heightened level of transparency and accountability required for Irish Water, given the level of Exchequer funding being provided to it.  This decision was based on Departmental analysis, supported by input from NewERA.  It is important to note that in establishing Irish Water within the Bord G&aacute;is (now Ervia) Group initially, this was on the basis that flexibility be maintained from the outset to allow for the potential separation of Irish Water at a future date.    <\/p>  <p>  On 19 September 2018, I received a report from the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in respect of a process of engagement that was undertaken at my request with the parties involved in the transformation programme for Irish Water, those being the utility itself, ICTU and relevant affiliated unions, Local Government management and my Department.  In this context, Irish Water has proposed fully integrating its operations and ending the current operational arrangements for the delivery of water services through service level agreements (SLAs) with local authorities.  The discussions with the parties have advanced on the basis that the current SLAs remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed.   <\/p>  <p>  In considering the report in consultation with my Government colleagues, I am particularly mindful of the WRC&rsquo;s comments that uncertainty about the next phase of transformation appears to be causing staffing difficulties at Local Government level and that further delay in providing the necessary clarity could exacerbate this situation and increase risks to the safe and effective delivery of water and wastewater services.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in the interests of clarity, I am asking the parties to now engage in a process to work towards the development of a stable structural and operational framework for the future. I am grateful for the commitment of the WRC to facilitate this process.  My Department is currently communicating with the parties in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the question of a constitutional amendment on the public ownership of water services, the position is that I undertook to endeavour to bring forward wording capable of being tabled as an amendment to the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.

The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.  To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require that owners or occupiers take appropriate measures on derelict sites, to acquire derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and to apply a derelict sites levy on the registered owners of derelict sites. <\/p>  <p>  It is open to any person to contact a local authority in relation to a particular site which may be considered a derelict site for the purposes of the Act. Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a register of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site. Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the register for any local authority area can be inspected at the offices of the relevant authority. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas. <\/p>  <p>  Under the recently introduced provisions of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy will increase from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020, in respect of sites included on the respective local authority derelict and vacant site registers in 2019.  This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development while also combatting land hoarding. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400072#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400072#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[47169\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400072#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of the recent announcement of the mica redress scheme; the date in 2019 from which homes will begin to be repaired under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[47009\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400072#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the establishment of a mica redress scheme; the proposed commencement date of same; if homeowners previously unaware of mica contamination in their homes will be included in the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 122 together.<\/p><p>The Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016, to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.<\/p><p>On 13 June 2017, the report of the was published and included eight recommendations, which my Department is actively progressing with the relevant stakeholders, prioritising the implementation of Recommendations 1 and 2. <\/p><p>With regard to Recommendation 1, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) Technical Committee, established to scope and fast track the development of a standardised protocol, has met on several occasions.

An annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out, on a short-term basis, i.e. for 14 days or less at a time, of a person&rsquo;s entire home where it is their primary residence.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it as a Short Term Letting (STL), they will require planning permission to do so unless the property is already permitted to be used for tourism \/ short-term letting purposes.

Where this level of future population and housing growth is to be located and how it will be prioritised within counties, will be a matter for the local authorities to determine through their County Development Plans.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  <\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.  Included in the exemptions under Schedule 4 are properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis, and properties that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme.  In general, the Acts maintain the long-standing position that all properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable, including all private childcare facilities.  There are no proposals under consideration for a discount of commercial rates for childcare service providers in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner of Valuation, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4. As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  If the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. Also, there is a right of appeal to the Courts on a point of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400073#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":137,"content":"<p>Question No. 114 answered with Question No. 99.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Social Behaviour","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400073#WRC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[47048\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400073#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the powers that local authorities have in terms of tenancy agreements in dealing with families that have continually broken the law and disturbed the peace.","asker":"1235","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>Actions to deal with law-breaking and disturbances of the peace, as well as anti-social behaviour in respect of all types of tenancies, is primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are responsible, under the Housing Acts 1966-2014, for the management and maintenance of their housing stock and the management of their estates, including taking appropriate measures to counter anti-social behaviour by their tenants.

It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, rented accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the recent purchase of the apartments in question by an investment company, it is important to remember that the priority is to ensure an increase in the overall supply of new homes  whether available to purchase or rent.  Given the highlighted lack of properties available to rent in the Dublin area, increased rental supply is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, provides more stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility. Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of additional tenancy protection measures were introduced in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to enhance tenants&rsquo; security, including:<\/p>  <p>  - The abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground;<\/p>  <p>  - The extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years; and<\/p>  <p>  - Protection for existing tenants to remain in situ where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, other than in exceptional circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  These provisions apply to all apartments which are the subject of a tenancy within the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400073#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400073#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[46903\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400073#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he met with officials from Fingal County Council regarding the roll-out of affordable housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The development of publicly owned residential lands for social and affordable housing is a top priority for this Government, particularly, in Dublin and other large urban areas, where housing access and affordability pressures are greatest.

This process began on 25 April 2018 and involved a number of Government Departments and public bodies, including the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authority representatives. The misuse of scramblers in public parks was a particular point of focus. <\/p>  <p>  Following these consultations, a number of relevant pieces of legislation were brought to the attention of the Office of the Attorney General by my Department, to determine whether any legislative amendments were necessary to assist in curbing activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned, without giving rise to any unintended negative legislative consequences. <\/p>  <p>  My Department received formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General last week. The advice is comprehensive in nature and is now being carefully considered by my officials, together with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the context of road traffic legislation.

The numbers of the cases on hands will always include a cohort of cases where a decision has been made and the applicant has been notified of same, but where the applicant has yet to swear their oath of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State and be granted their certificate of naturalisation at a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose.  In this context in excess of 3,000 of the cases on hand have already received their decision and my Department is currently issuing invitations to these individuals to attend a citizenship ceremony on 26 November next to make their declaration before a judge and to be granted their certificate of naturalisation.<\/p><p>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While INIS endeavours that most straightforward cases are processed to a decision within six months, this target has to be seen in the context of the work involved in dealing with volumes of applications, some of which can be very complex in nature, and the need to ensure that each applicant fulfils the statutory conditions for naturalisation. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  As outlined, even where a decision may be made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  In the circumstances it is not possible to give any meaningful average processing time per application.<\/p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken.  <\/p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.<\/p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application.

Noting that the Deputy has requested, in effect, that the unanalysed data be provided, the interpretation of such data would not be clear. The requirement for analysis reflects the complexities involved. For example, some women may have had multiple smears, not necessarily read in the same lab; slides may have changed by one grade or multiple grades which is a complexity that would not be shown by a simple breakdown across labs; labs dealt with different regional populations; in the early years of the programme, it was dealing with an unscreened population which is a further complexity. <\/p>  <p>  Once again we wish to emphasise there is in no way any intention to withhold this information.  Following significant efforts, appropriate expertise has been sought to ensure that the necessary analysis can be done such that it is anticipated the information sought by the Deputy will be available by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  In the broader context in which this data is sought, it is important to reiterate that Dr Scally is clear in his report that the Inquiry is satisfied with the quality management processes in the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck. As previously outlined to the Deputy, it would be expected that false negatives would have occurred in all laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck since its inception.  It is important to emphasise that false negatives are not automatically negligence, and indeed that they are unavoidable in any cervical screening programme. As stated by Judge Meenan in his recently published report, smear tests are a screening test, not a diagnostic process. A significant number of smears will be reported as showing no abnormalities despite there being possible abnormalities present. This does not, of itself, amount to negligence on the part of the person(s) reading the smear. However, &ldquo;missed&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;missed&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the 18 month query, the HSE have advised that there was never a criteria in place whereby smears taken less than 18 months from diagnosis were excluded from review. The slides identified for further review were reviewed from a minimum of 1 month prior to diagnosis to up to 78 months prior to diagnosis. The HSE further advise that the Director General has written to Dr Gabriel Scally to provide clarity on this matter and that Dr Scally has welcomed the clarification and published correspondence in this regard on the website of the Scoping Inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400076#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400077#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[47261\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400077#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the medicines that patients with multiple sclerosis have access to through the healthcare system; the difference between medicines that patients here with multiple sclerosis have access to through the healthcare system compared with other European countries; and the average length of time for which persons here with the condition must wait for the delivery and administration of medicines.","asker":"1280","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the pricing and reimbursement of medicines; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400077#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Accommodation Provision","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400077#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[47262\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400077#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is actively engaged in a process to guarantee the future of Lifford Community Hospital; if proposals are being considered for a replacement facility for the Lifford area in the context of post 2021; if so, the timeframe for such proposals; the details of the extent of proposals being considered for the hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>The need for additional beds and the potential to develop a replacement facility to the existing community nursing unit in Lifford will be reviewed further post 2021, when new Census data is available and the Health Service Capacity Review and the National Development Plan have been advanced.

Shortly thereafter all the recently planted ash trees on that site were destroyed under Departmental supervision. The ash trees on another 10 sites where trees from the same batch of imported plants were planted out (approximately 33,000 plants in total) were also destroyed.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2013 the Department, continuing its efforts to attempt to prevent the spread of the disease, introduced a Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) to remove infected ash and restore forest areas planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by disease. These findings of infected plantations continued to increase, as ash dieback disease was found over much of the country.  In April 2018 Minister of State Doyle announced a Review of the National Response to ash dieback disease as it became increasingly evident from continued findings supported by the latest scientific advice that eradication of ash dieback disease is no longer feasible. Given this position, the Department has taken the view that its policy response must also change to one of living with the disease. While the Reconstitution Scheme is no longer available as it is under review, forest owners affected by ash dieback disease can avail of support under the Woodland Improvement Scheme. The review of the Reconstitution Scheme is nearing completion and the results of that review and the consequent approach in terms of management of the disease going forward will be available in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has organised various information events since ash dieback disease was first identified in October 2012 including an All Ireland Chalara Conference and nationwide public meetings. Advice continues to be provided by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectors to foresters in the public and private sectors on the biology of the disease and recognition of symptoms as well as on the procedures around the clearance of affected forest plantations and infected nursery stock. Inspectors also regularly provide briefings for or attend information meetings for landowners and other relevant stakeholders and representative groups such as the IFA, the GAA, and the Ash Society.<\/p>  <p>  The origins of ash dieback disease are not certain but scientists have suggested the disease may have been introduced to Europe from eastern Asia.  The fungus which causes the disease has a complex life cycle. Infection first makes its way into a tree when the spores of the fungus are carried in the air and land on healthy leaves over the summer months. The fungus then grows into the leaves and down into the leaf petiole or rachis, and progressively into twigs, branches, and the stem.<\/p>  <p>  Where the disease is already present in a locality further local spread is likely to be caused by spores borne on the wind, each year travelling many kilometres from the original source. There is also a risk of introducing the disease into a locality where it is not yet present (and where that locality is at a considerable distance from an existing source of infection) by bringing already diseased ash seeds or plants into that area for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of simple and practical steps which can help avoid the further spread of the disease. For example before leaving a forest where ash trees are present, landowners and other visitors are advised to remove all plant debris such as leaves etc. from clothing and footwear. Plant material should not be removed from such sites and where the presence of the disease is suspected, and the following hygiene measures should be observed:<\/p>  <p>  - Footwear: Wash off all plant and soil debris from boots. Spray your boots with disinfectant and dispose of any used water onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse.<\/p>  <p>  - Clothing: Check all clothing for any plant material.<\/p>  <p>  - Tools &amp;amp; equipment: Wash off all plant and soil debris and apply disinfectant afterwards.

Harmful organisms may be associated with a variety of internationally traded plants, plant products including wood and wood packaging material such as crates and pallets which can be associated with goods of any kind. In order to address this potential threat of introduction of a harmful organism in this manner and to protect the health of Ireland&rsquo;s forest resource there is comprehensive legislation in place, specified in the EU Plant Health Directive, (Council Directive 2000\/29\/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community) which describes inter alia particular import requirements for a range of commodities from origins where the presence of harmful forest pests and disease is known to occur.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the legislation is to protect the national forest estate against the introduction and spread of exotic forest pest and disease threats, through the implementation of import controls. Import controls relate to a variety of forest plants, wood and wood products and wood packaging material (which may be associated with goods of any kind). Wood products subject to import control by my Department include sawn wood, roundwood logs, fire wood and wood chip for biomass. Wood packaging material controls are largely targeted at products considered to pose a high plant health risk such as cut stone.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to import controls, my Department carries out forest health surveys for a variety of harmful organisms including a range of Protected Zone pests and other organisms regulated on an EU wide basis in forests and forest nurseries throughout the country. Within the context of the requirements of the EU Plant Health Directive, disease management policy is determined following the outcome of further surveys to confirm the extent of a disease and consultation around best practice in dealing with this disease.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work carried out by the Department, forest owners, forest nursery staff, and members of the public are asked to be vigilant for disease and report (with photographs, if possible) any sites where there are concerns about unusual ill health.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in terms of ash dieback my Department has  organised various information events since the  disease was first identified in October 2012 including an All Ireland Chalara Conference and nationwide public meetings.

The nature of the problem related to the crumbling of the concrete blockwork in the external walls of affected dwellings, thereby compromising their structural integrity and giving rise to considerable personal distress to the many homeowners involved. At that time, several hundred homes were suspected to be affected in north Donegal. The presence of muscovite mica in abundant quantities in the aggregate constituent of the concrete blocks was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of 2013, similar problems had also come to light in both public and private dwellings located in west Mayo and Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department on problems that had been identified with the concrete blockwork in their social housing stock. In this instance, it was the presence of pyrite in the aggregate constituent of the concrete block that was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks. The emergence of similar problems among private households located in County Mayo was also reported in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014 and 2015, there were significant representations, media reports and letters from affected homeowners illustrating the increasing scale of the problems emerging in the two counties, the progressive nature of the external wall cracking and the resultant structural distress in the affected properties.<\/p>  <p>  An Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016 and its terms of reference were limited to the investigation of the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.<\/p>  <p>  Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.

The Regulations to support the operation of Part 5 will be finalised shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I also introduced a new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan to enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties within a suitable price range.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, first-time buyers can also avail of the Help-To-Buy Scheme, which is intended to  alleviate some of the challenges faced by first-time buyers in providing  the required 10% deposit of the market value of the property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[47385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if local authorities have sought additional capital for the acquisition of building lands on which it might be proposed to build local authority houses as opposed to through the aegis of approved housing bodies; the degree to which previously owned local authority lands have been utilised for exclusively local authority house building purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>The development of publicly owned residential lands for social and affordable housing is a top priority for this Government. In this context, together with developing a significant build programme on their existing residential land bank, local authorities are also required to consider the availability of land for housing, particularly social and affordable housing, within their area of responsibility. <\/p><p>Given the priority of the strategic development of the local authority land bank, all local authority residential sites were mapped on the Rebuilding Ireland land map, which is available at the following link on the Rebuilding Ireland website, <i><\/i>.  The map includes details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites amounting to some 1,700 hectares, and local authorities have been requested to update the map on a quarterly basis.<\/p><p>&euro;2.4 billion is being provided for housing in 2019 and all local authorities are encouraged to bring forward viable and appropriate development proposals, which can be funded through the range of schemes and programmes that have been put in place.  For example, as part of Budget 2019, the Government announced &euro;310 million, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), for enabling infrastructure on Council lands to facilitate affordable housing. The first call issued to local authorities in June and further calls will be made in the weeks and months ahead. <\/p><p>In terms of providing housing support to the most vulnerable, a strong and growing social housing construction pipeline is now in place, as evidenced in the Quarter 2 2018 Social Housing Construction Status Report. Since the end of 2016, the number of schemes and homes in the programme has doubled. Activity on-site has also increased significantly, with 1,074 homes going on-site in Q2 this year alone. The Q2 2018 Report is available at the following link: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>In order to assist local authorities further my Department hosted a workshop last week to discuss strategic land development and the delivery of affordable housing. Further bilateral engagement between local authorities and my Department will now follow with a view to progressing further social and affordable projects on council lands.  <\/p><p>While the development of existing local authority sites is the priority, where a local authority identifies a need to acquire additional lands, it may seek to borrow the required finance from the Housing Finance Agency. Once the site is included within the social housing construction programme my Department would then normally consider recouping the land costs and any associated loan interest charges to the local authority, as part of the social housing project approval process. <\/p><p>In accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, the decision to borrow is a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority concerned, who have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions and are accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. <\/p><p>Section 106 of the Act also provides that local authorities must obtain the consent of the appropriate Minister to undertake borrowing. In this regard, sanction to borrow for housing land acquisition is submitted by the local authority to my Department, and sanction may be granted based on an assessment of the financial viability of potential loans insofar as individual local authorities are concerned, and an assessment as to whether the borrowing can be accommodated within the context of the fiscal rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Eligibility","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO03500"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[47386\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he expects to be in a position to revise upwards the income limits appertaining to eligibility for local authority houses and local authority loans in view of the extent to which such applicants are currently excluded and forced into the private rental market, which they cannot afford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway.

This has led to a multi-faceted building control reform agenda, which commenced implementation in 2014 with the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.<\/p><p>Under these Regulations, the owner of a building must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he\/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their work through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates. The roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers, etc. during building works are set out in the <i>Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, <\/i>which is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i><\/i>. This has brought clarity and accountability to the roles of those involved in construction projects and a focus on compliance with Building Regulations from design through to construction. <\/p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. <\/p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) was set up to provide centralised oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. Under this project, the Building Control Management System (BCMS) was developed. A Framework for Building Control Authorities was prepared to standardise work practices, a compliance support facility has been established and a training programme is being developed and rolled out. <\/p><p>Also, and most fundamentally, steps are in place for the continued strengthening of the inspection regime in Building Control Authorities to carry out meaningful risk-based targeted inspections of building works. Dublin City Council has been confirmed as the lead building control authority, creating a central and stable executive structure to oversee the local building control function, with regular communication and feedback between the lead authority and other local authorities.<\/p><p>The Government has also approved the General Scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register) Bill to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist sub-contractors. The main objective of the Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations within the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist sub-contractors provides consumers with assurance that they are dealing with competent and compliant operators.  The drafting of the Bill is being progressed and while I am not in a position at this stage to give a precise indication of the timeline for the Bill's publication, my Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication in Q1 2019.  <\/p><p>These reforms have already brought, and, through their full implementation, will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations.<\/p><p>It is important, however, to note that under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and\/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018111400084#WRO04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"}]
