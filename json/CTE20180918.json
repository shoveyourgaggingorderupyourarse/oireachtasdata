I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  I am just thinking that the attacks normally do not come from this side of the table; from my experience, it is the other side of the table that might choose to have a go sometimes.<\/p> <p>  I am the director general of the Construction Industry Federation.  Mr. Dominic Doheny, its president, is here with me.<\/p><p>I want to give a little background information on the Construction Industry Federation.  We represent the entire construction industry.  That includes contractors that build infrastructure, commercial and industrial development, housebuilders building everything from one-off housing to developments with 1,000 units and, very important recently, specialist contractors, particularly mechanical and electrical contractors, who build the industrial buildings that attract the likes of Google, Facebook, BMS, the big farmers and so on.  <br\/><br\/>There are approximately 40,000 enterprises working in the construction industry.  The bulk of these are considered to be SMEs with fewer than ten employees.  Overall, there are about 140,000 people working in the industry, and every month for the past four years nearly an extra 1,000 have been added.  This is a big record and indicative of very clear growth.  It is a Central Statistics Office figure.  Simply put, the economy and society are dependent on the industry for construction but also for employment and opportunity in every community in Ireland.  Mr. Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland, stated recently that every sector in the economy depends on construction for its ability to do business and its competitiveness.  When construction works, Ireland works.  The more competitively this industry can deliver construction, the more competitive the economy is generally.<br\/><br\/>On a positive note, data show that on an annual basis the volume of output in building and construction increased by 20.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.  Output volumes increased by 30%, 10.1%, and 8.1%, respectively, in residential building, civil engineering and non-residential building work.  There was an increase of 18.1% in the value of production in the same period.  The value of construction reached approximately &euro;20 billion in 2017, which is just 7% of GDP.  On the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today, in line with the fact that the National Ploughing Championships are being held in Offaly, the Central Bank states agricultural output has surged to &euro;8 billion.  The figure for construction is two and a half times that.  It is widely agreed that Ireland requires the industry to account for about 12% of GDP for sustainable economic and social development.<br\/><br\/>Members will note from our budget submission that we did not have a major shopping list and that we are focusing on the alignment of State bodies and regulatory agencies behind construction rather than on taxation policy measures.  Essentially, we believe the majority of key policies have been put in place at national level by successive Governments.  What is needed now is better alignment of the State's agents and resources with industry to deliver housing, infrastructure and, important, the workers the industry now requires.  The focus is correctly on resolving the housing crisis in the near term.  We outline a number of suggested actions derived from the experience of our members on the front line of housing delivery.  Our budget submission, however, focuses on two other areas that we are warning must be addressed if the housing crisis is to be solved.  Without adequate delivery of infrastructure, residential development will stall, and nationally the thousands of homes we produce will not form the vibrant, dynamic communities that we need.<br\/><br\/>Second, our budget submission sounds a clear warning that the industry is now facing a wider skills shortage that we must address.  For example, a 2018 survey carried out with DIT found that 81% of federation members hired tradespeople but that only 14% of these companies believed there was a sufficient number of skilled tradespeople in the market.  <br\/><br\/>A report we produced in 2016 stated we would require an additional 110,000 workers to deliver on the Government's Rebuilding Ireland strategy and the national development plan.  Since that time, the ambition of these strategies has increased while there has been no co-ordinated policy intervention to increase the number of qualified workers - including graduates and apprentices and those in the trade, craft and professional or technological areas - being produced by the education and training system.<br\/><br\/>To overcome the skills gap in the immediate term, the industry will source foreign labour to meet demand.  In the medium term, it is imperative that our own education and training system produce more suitable graduates to ensure we retain the talent, experience and the intellectual property produced in the construction industry over the next decade.<\/p><p>Construction has always had a major impact on employment.  As output in the industry increases so does the number employed.  Direct construction employment now stands at 137,300 people, just in the first quarter of 2018, and that was an extra 3,900 people since the last quarter of 2017.  This translates into almost 6.2% of the total Irish workforce.  From 2007 to 2013, the construction industry lost approximately 160,000 jobs, which represented almost 65% of all construction jobs according to the CSO.  That loss was the more severe in construction than in any other sector.  It is, therefore, in the interest of the wider economy for the Government to work with the industry to attract more skilled workers into construction, particularly from within the education system and the Diaspora.  In our budget submission, we call for a number of initiatives that are required to increase the number of apprentices coming into the industry and also to increase investment in traineeships.  Delaying action now may mean skills shortages in the near future at a time when demand for construction will be at its highest &ndash; this will see increasing wages, rising business costs and a loss of value for money for the Exchequer.  <\/p><p> The three issues in our budget submission, housing, infrastructure and skills, all impact on our industry&rsquo;s ability to build the housing and infrastructure our economy and society require to sustain our recovery.  If we work together, we can deliver 35,000 houses per year and the &euro;116 billion infrastructure plan while rebuilding the construction industry and, for the first time in decades, putting it on a stable and sustainable footing for the future.  The timely implementation of the national planning framework, NPF, and the National Development Plan 2018-2027, NDP, is paramount, especially in areas such as transport, housing, health and education.  Failure to deliver will damage competitiveness of the wider Irish economy with resultant negative impacts on employment, gross domestic product, GDP, growth and exports.  We have engaged with State agencies and Government bodies over the past few months to improve the efficiency of delivery of construction activity.  Local authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Office of Government Procurement and SOLAS have all given us a clear message that these bodies are not adequately resourced or motivated to facilitate the delivery of housing, infrastructure and skilled workers.<\/p><p> Important processes controlled by the State that impact on the delivery of construction, such as planning, waste, utilities connections and procurement, are delaying delivery of essential construction.  In this budget submission, we are also calling on the Government to increase ambitiously investment in research into construction products and services.  Increased innovation is a key step towards improved productivity in the industry.  Every euro invested in research into efficiency and productivity in construction will provide good returns to every other sector in the economy.  This will improve the competitiveness of the economy and benefit all other sectors.  I will quickly go through some areas.  In regard to people, the apprenticeship model requires fixing in a number of key subsectors, particularly the wet trades - mainly plasterers, block layers and tilers.  A recent survey carried out with the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, found that 71% of CIF members do not hire apprentices anymore as they are unable to afford the cost.  To repurpose the model, we are suggesting that employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions be zero rated for those engaging apprentices in trades in need of stimulus.  In addition, SOLAS should introduce apprenticeship trainee grants for a limited time until the shortage of construction apprenticeships has been addressed and payments of apprenticeship fees in phases 4 and 6 should be reintroduced, as part of the apprentice&rsquo;s training, from the significant national training fund budget that the industry contributes to annually.  This measure was removed in 2014.  I understand from a recent meeting in the Department of Education and Skills that the national training fund has an excess of close to &euro;400 million at the moment that cannot be accessed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537282800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Parlon to heed the time if he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#V00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537282800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Our Diaspora is a pool of expertise stored in other jurisdictions at the moment unfortunately.  We are trying to target that group.  Relocation to Ireland, however, is a major challenge with the cost of car insurance, high rents and lower salaries all cited as issues.  We are not making it easy for our Irish people to relocate here.  In one area, a skilled worker with seven years experience in construction in Australia, the United States, Dubai or Canada will find that the qualifications he or she gained there are not  recognised by Irish authorities.<\/p><p>We have raised this issue for quite a while with SOLAS but it has still not been addressed.  We also recommend that the Government introduce a tax allowance for relocation costs to assist the skilled Diaspora return to Ireland and co-fund with industry a marketing campaign to attract people home.  Mr. Talbot will probably say there is a skill shortage in his area and right across the board, so we are all competing with each other.  We have to promote each particular area, the benefits of each and we will be seeking co-funding for that.  Due to the volume of construction activity in the pipeline, we must make it easier for companies to source foreign talent.  Similar to other sectors such as information technology, IT, we must now put construction trades on the eligible list for work permits for skilled workers from outside the EU.  Due to the introduction in the industry of a minimum wage, recommended by the Labour Court and approved by the Government through last year&rsquo;s sectoral employment order, these workers will receive good wages and have good conditions.  The delays of a minimum of 12 weeks in the work permit section before any permit application is even being considered is ridiculous and does not make any sense in these times of scarce labour supply. <\/p><p> Finally, we need to increase the level of research and development and innovation in the area of construction products and services.  Ireland could be an international exemplar in several construction related areas such as data centre construction, building information modelling, BIM, lean construction and other construction practices.  To facilitate this, we are asking the Government to establish a national construction research and education forum to increase funding to construction related areas at third level and within the research community. <\/p><p> Delivery of infrastructure is key-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537282800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I ask Mr. Parlon to be brief.

Infrastructure is key to delivering for Irish society.  Public procurement and how contracts are awarded to the lowest price tender is having a detrimental impact on the industry, on members of the industry and on the quality of products.  It is not just in construction but across the board.  We need a sustainable procurement system that will deliver quality construction and, of course, realistic and robust pricing.  We have proposed using the globally recognised \"most economic advantageous\" tender criteria which takes on board quality standards as well as price etc.  It is also important that there is early contractor involvement so that the contractor can be involved at the project management and design stages.  Housing is a major issue that everybody is concerned about.  We are asking the Government to extend the help to buy scheme beyond 31 December because it provides surety to first-time buyers and to the banks lending to the builders providing the first time houses as well as much stability.  We feel that is critical to give confidence to the banking system and the house building community.<\/p> <p>  The last budget announced Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, which was a positive initiative to fund smaller builders that do not have access to international funds.

I am going to share a brief period of time with my colleague, Mr. Paddy Malone as well.  We will try to rattle through it as quickly as possible.  To set the scene, our budget recommendations over the last three years have focused mainly on the need for investment to make up for the lost decade during our economic recession.<\/p><p>The year 2019 will be important for Ireland as we confront an uncertain world not just limited to Brexit.  Our economic competitiveness is increasingly under threat from the high cost of doing business and the general high cost of living across Ireland.  Government must focus on addressing the issues contributing to these high costs, from making child care more affordable to increasing the delivery of housing.  It must also ensure the secure and affordable provision of energy for all businesses and communities across the country as we face into our obligations for the future in terms of climate change and control.  While the economy is performing strongly, the threat to Irish businesses posed by Brexit is severe.  Further, Ireland is uniquely exposed to increasing volatility in global trade as other states become increasingly protectionist.<\/p><p> In drafting our submission, we consulted with our chambers, who make up a network of 41 affiliated chambers located in every major town and city and region in the country and represent businesses of all sizes and across all sectors.  The message we heard from the network in these consultations was clear: we must focus on the delivery of Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan if we are to ensure continued growth and we must take steps to boost our competitiveness and resilience, particularly ahead of Brexit.<\/p><p> Turning to infrastructure and a sustainable future through investment in infrastructure, budget 2019 will be the first budget following finalisation of Project Ireland 2040 and it is critical that investments announced in the national development plan begin and that the strategic plans set out in the national planning framework are followed.  Investment in infrastructure has been a major concern of business for the last number of years following a decade of under-investment.  Given the limited budget package available, the priority must be on capital spending that will address growth-constraining infrastructural deficits and will enable all of our cities to compete for investment and jobs as they drive growth and unlock the potential of their wider regions.  Government must ensure that the plans laid out in the national development plan and set in the national planning framework are committed to, met and monitored closely with appropriate key performance indicators, KPIs.  We must ensure that Ireland moves closer to the highest levels of public investment in infrastructure in the OECD, the current average at OECD level being 3% to 4% of GDP. <\/p><p> Chambers Ireland has in the past called for the establishment of what has become known as \"a rainy day fund\".  We would like to see the establishment of an equalisation fund to ensure that future shocks to our economy do not lead to a decline in capital investment.  We could use this equalisation fund to bridge any gaps in capital investment.  Given that we are about to enter a period of economic volatility, we support the commitment of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to the establishment of a rainy day fund.  In addition, given the national development plan is underpinned by projections of the economy's potential growth - assumed at a minimum of 2% over the period 2022 to 2027 - we believe that using the fund to support the delivery of the national development plan, should growth fall below the required 2%, would ensure that we do not find ourselves unable to maintain investment in capital infrastructure in times of recession.  We also recommend that the Government monitors corporation tax receipts and transfers any revenue generated above profile to the rainy day fund.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Paddy Malone, from Dundalk Chamber, who will speak in particular about Brexit and tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#W00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537282800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will focus in my comments on the Chambers Ireland position on Brexit.  Dundalk has its own view on Brexit, on which I am happy to take questions later if members so wish.  There is unanimous acknowledgement that once the UK departs the EU the Irish economy will suffer badly, with many Irish businesses likely to suffer adverse consequences.  It is likely that current uncertainty is damaging confidence and delaying decision making and investments, which will have an adverse economic impact into the future.<\/p> <p>  Chambers Ireland carried out a survey of its members, which found that while Brexit presents some opportunities, its presents far more challenges; it will result in a reduction in trade, the return of a hard border with Northern Ireland and it will also have a negative impact on tourism, particularly tourism from across the Border.  The number of people crossing the Border to visit areas such as Carlingford Lough, Bundoran and Ballyshannon has decreased and these communities are feeling the difference.  In addition, the value of sterling is dropping.  The almost certain reduction in trade between Ireland and the UK will have a disproportionate impact on indigenous firms in that they will be less able to react and find a European market.<\/p><p>We have that problem.  Most of the members we represent are SMEs.  Their first toe in the water in exporting was to the UK and some of them have never gone beyond it.  The Government must ensure businesses are supported to diversify markets, upscale their staff, as required, and ensure the tourism industry remains competitive and continues to attract visitors from the UK.  The Government should continue to make funding available through the Brexit loan scheme and to expand the funds to support more businesses that may wish to innovate in response to Brexit.  <\/p><p> The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, ran a seminar in Dundalk last week and we had 200 people without even having to try to attract an attendance.  Last March, 500 people attended when we had a similar joint event with Newry and there is huge concern in the region.<\/p><p> SBCI does not see itself supporting retail or other sectors which have been specifically damaged and it is a point Chambers Ireland has made to SBCI.<\/p><p> The tourism industry is a significant source of employment across every region of Ireland.  The UK is the single largest source market for the tourism industry and provides a high percentage of the regional tourism business in Ireland, with 41% of UK visitors staying outside of Dublin in 2016.  The problem is that with sterling dropping in value, whether it is cross-Border tourism or east-west tourism, that figure is going to fall.<\/p><p> In a recent survey, Chamber Network found that the impact of Brexit on the tourism industry was one of the top three concerns of members.  For that reason, we believe the reduced 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector should be retained.<\/p><p> In addition, it is now more crucial than ever that we promote Irish tourism abroad and seek to attract new visitors from outside of the UK and traditional sources.  We must increase the capacity of State agencies to promote Ireland as a destination for new markets to reduce our reliance on the UK, the US and traditional markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Malone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537282800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>To conclude, the committee will note that our submission is very comprehensive but we have only touched on some of the core points in this discussion.

I am an accountant by profession although my wife believes it is the other way around.  What we find is that the entrepreneurial relief has some appeal but it is not enough.  There are a number of businesses in the Dundalk area that have gone into Newry, because the relief is there and they know it.  When one is sitting down talking to a business and trying to convince it to stay here it is not possible.  Deputy Breathnach will probably be aware of the business I am thinking of, which got a lot of publicity recently.<\/p> <p>  Many entrepreneurs in Ireland make their money and walk away at an early stage, earlier than they should.  The tax relief does not encourage them to build the pot up any bigger, to scale up.  When they walk away, they do not go again.  They are not quick enough to go back in again.

It all depends on where the question is directed but with regard to housing, development finance is extremely difficult to get.  The pillar banks are tapering off on this activity at the moment and our members are very much turning towards the mezzanine funders again.  These funders are at somewhere between 8% and 14%, depending on the location as it is very demographic-sensitive.  One then obviously has to factor that percentage into the end product, which makes some end products unviable.  That is a major challenge.<\/p> <p>  Those who are buying the houses, meanwhile, need mortgages.  At a national meeting recently we put the following question to our members.  If we had 10,000 extra houses in the system at the moment, would they sell them?  The answer was \"No\" because even if buyers qualify for the potential rules, the availability of mortgages is not there.  Most banks are capping out mid-year or towards August, with the applications for the balance of the year then pushed into the following year.  This is a major issue at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The second question concerned the vacant site levy.  We as an industry absolutely support the Government's initiative on this.  We do not support land-hoarding.  One must analyse the matter in great depth, however.  There are parts of the country where people might qualify for the levy but where viability is a major issue.  If they cannot prove to their banks that their lands are viable then they will never develop them, but the lands will grow more expensive as the levy is applied every year.  Some county councils are more active than others in this regard, but we would put a major question mark over viability.  The farmers got an exit from this recently, but we have members who have land which is not viable, where they cannot build, for which they cannot get finance, but upon which the levy is being applied.

This is to be welcomed.  The encouragement to look for alternative suppliers and customers is also moving along well and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, particularly the office in Louth, are doing an excellent job in that regard.<br\/><br\/>As for problems, however, the volatility of sterling is causing particular problems for the retail sector and we are looking for some kind of support for that area.  The SBCI will not support retail <i>per se<\/i>.  It will help develop an Internet presence or other such techniques but there are no supports for a straight-forward shop in a town, for example.  What we are looking for here is a rates step-down.  Louth, in particular, is having its rates revalued at present.  Without moving the Border from north Louth to south Louth, we would say that one could reduce the rates by a certain percentage in the most northerly area, Carlingford.  Dundalk is next, where one could reduce the rates by a slightly smaller percentage, followed by a slightly lower reduction in mid-Louth, which is where Deputy Breathnach is from.  Drogheda might then get some reduction, but not as much.  These kind of relieving provisions would help greatly.  <br\/><br\/>What is critical, however, is clarity over the movement of goods.  The movement of people is also indirectly related to this issue as 3,000 people cross the Border in Louth each day out of 26,000 crossings on the entire island.  I have two employees who travel from Monaghan, travelling in and out of Northern Ireland and through Cullaville in south Armagh to get to work.  They then have to reverse that process.  One of them said to me that she did not care about being late in the morning but was very anxious to get home in the evening to pick the children up.  I cannot argue with her.  The implications then of Brexit for a whole host of projects, and for the cost of doing business in the Border area, is significant.  Any measures that can target the region would be a help.  <br\/><br\/>A further suggestion in the Chambers Ireland submission is that the living city initiative be extended to every city designated in the national development plan.  As Deputy Breathnach will be aware, I have been banging on about this since 2000 and this should have been done for Dundalk years ago.  Dundalk has a population of 40,000 and is three times the size of Kilkenny.  Kilkenny has the living city initiative allowance, however, and we do not.  Dundalk is an industrial town that in the 20th century saw a huge shift away from its traditional heavy engineering base.

There were issues about the cost but house building is a major contributor to the Exchequer.  If we can double house building, it will be a bonanza for the Exchequer and, while there are issues about VAT, the scheme provides compensation to first-time buyers.

How can we fast-track that? <\/p> <p>  I have a serious concern about the issue of procurement in a pre-Brexit or post-Brexit situation.  Mr. Parlon referred to the issue of road construction.  The main players from the north east and the Border counties tend to operate in the south of the country.  However, the massive players are Northern Ireland rural construction companies.  What has been done to ensure that those gaps are filled?  If standards are not the same, or if there is any deviation, we could be left with a dearth of opportunities to open and expand road construction.<\/p><p>I know Mr. Malone will not like to hear me saying this.  WuXi Biologics and the various developments that Dundalk was able to attract were referred to.  It was probably able to attract them because of the chamber of commerce and the excellent communication between the colleges and the local authority to bring about improvements.  Is there a danger that places will become unattractive because of the unavailability of housing?  That is a serious concern I have.  We are dealing with students and an influx of people who are coming in from outside to help provide employment in these factories.  Unless we do something strategically to ensure that the landbanks are there, I worry that places are in danger of becoming no-go areas because people will not be able to get accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#EE00300","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537282800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I ask speakers to keep their replies quite brief.

As Deputy Breathnach said, it is for housing schemes in excess of 100 units.  The feedback we are getting is that it is working very well once it gets to the board.  However, that is not when the process commences.  The process commences with the informal meetings that one has to schedule with the local authority, etc.  That is where the delay is.  We were recently before the board, and we voiced our concern about delays that our members are experiencing in scheduling those meetings and the prolonged engagement, or lack of engagement, we have with the local authority before the issue reaches the board.  The board members took account of our concerns and said that they would look into them.  That is an area of great concern for us.<\/p> <p>  I will refer to procurement, which Mr. Parlon will also address.  That dovetails into the Deputy's last question on the unavailability of manpower, etc., in the regions.  I also chair the regional committee of the Construction Industry Federation.  Procurement is extremely hot.  The lack of any sort of common procurement policy across all agencies is causing major concerns.  Let us take for example the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills, the local authority or Irish Water.  While we have a national procurement organisation, its policy is not adopted by all.  That is a major concern.  There are different rules in every county.  There is no commonality between them, and therefore our members are losing out hugely.  I am sure that Deputies experience that on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  Local contractors are the backbone of a lot of local communities.  If we start losing the small and medium-sized local contractors a cohort within the community will be lost.  If people can be employed locally it is a reason for them to stay at home.  If procurement is not addressed, there is a risk of losing that cohort within our industry, which is a major concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#FF00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Doheny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537282800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>There is no question that the point Deputy Breathnach made about WuXi Biologics, foreign direct investment and the cost of housing is a concern.

That is why we need to invest in both resources and encouragement.  There are massive delays with the likes of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There was a period when it did not have enough people and issues were going on forever.  In the section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that deals with work permits, there is a ridiculous 12-week delay before an application is even considered.

The Department says it does not have the resources, people are on leave and so on.<\/p> <p>  I refer also to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The very strict regulations with regard to building waste are now a factor.  The waste may be soil and stone, and if construction takes place on a brownfield site, God knows what is there.  All that waste has to be examined and a determination made on whether it needs to go to a special landfill.  In some cases it has to be exported.  One cannot get a section 27 licence from the EPA because it does not have the resources to examine it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#FF00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1537282800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>We are a budgetary oversight committee, not an environment committee so I will bring us back to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091800002#GG00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537282800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There are concerns for the industry in this regard in the context of spending.

That group was set up at a time when the economy was going backwards and it did a great job to save money at the time.  Now as we need to expand significantly, we need to look at how the expertise it has built up is rolled out and, as Mr. Parlon said earlier, consider the economic value rather than just the cheapest price.  Second, on the point of whether housing will hinder job creation, there are many issues at play.  We have covered some in our submission such as maximising the workforce available and making sure that people in houses in an area can go to work because child care facilities, for example, are provided.  Do we also need to improve the use of the housing stock that we have so that people move through a life cycle of housing stock?  In that case the right mix of apartments, family homes and retirement homes is also needed.  There are many things we can do beyond asking whether we can just get bricks and mortar out there.

As the Chairman has already said, I am joined by Mr. Gary Healy who is our director of regulatory and public policy and is a member of the senior management team at Eir.  Members have been provided with additional material by way of a written submission and we are happy to take questions from members on any of that material.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that Eir is the principal provider of fixed line and mobile telecommunications services in Ireland.  The company has approximately 2 million customers and operates the most extensive network in the country providing a range of advanced voice, data, broadband and ICT services to the residential, small business, enterprise and public sector markets.  Open Eir is the largest wholesale operator in Ireland, providing products and services to more than 40 wholesale customers and 400,000 end users across a range of regulated and unregulated markets.  Eir is also a major contributor to the Irish economy, spending over &euro;1 billion annually.<\/p> <p>  In April 2018, a consortium led by the NJJ group, which is owned by the French telecoms entrepreneur Xavier Niel, completed the purchase of Eir, which has led the company into a period of exciting development and innovation.  The NJJ team has a wealth of international telecommunications experience, which is already proving to be of huge benefit to both Eir and its customers.  The group has a proven track record of investment in telecoms infrastructure and enhanced customer propositions.  My appointment as CEO was accompanied by the appointment of Mr. David McRedmond as Chairman and soon after that by the appointment of my management team and a new majority Irish board of directors.  The new management team exemplifies our dynamic transformation, our focus on our network and customers and on our continued success in the Irish market.  I am also delighted to say that all members of the management team, with one exception, have been promoted from within the company and we now have an equal female to male split on the team.  <\/p> <p>  We invest substantially in our network and no other telecoms company in Ireland is anywhere close to matching Eir&rsquo;s historical level of investment in networks right across the country.  In the past five years, Eir has invested &euro;1.5 billion of its own capital in its infrastructure across Ireland, more than any other national telecom operator in Europe relative to their revenue.  To give some idea of the scale, the Irish Government has allocated &euro;1.6 billion of capital spend to maintain and develop the national road network over a similar duration.  As a result of Eir&rsquo;s investment, two out of every three fixed broadband connections in the country use the Eir network and our overall fibre broadband roll-out has now passed 75% of all Irish homes and businesses.  The Eir mobile network currently delivers 4G mobile coverage to 96% of the population in Ireland and is nationwide, serving all counties in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In April 2017 Eir entered into an agreement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to pass over 300,000 specific premises with high-speed fibre broadband, mostly fibre to the home technology, supporting broadband speeds up to 1 Gbps or 1,000 Mbps.  During the national broadband plan, NBP, procurement process, the Department had written to all operators asking for any plans to roll out high-speed broadband in rural Ireland in order that it could adjust the NBP intervention area accordingly.  This is in line with the rules covering state aid.  The Department received roll-out plans from a number of companies but Eir was the only one which committed, by agreement with the Department, to deliver additional investment and Eir has actually delivered on that.  I am pleased to inform the committee that Eir will deliver even more than that to which it committed in 2017 and will pass an additional 30,000 homes and businesses in rural Ireland, bringing the total premises to 330,000 and the total private capital investment up to &euro;250 million.  At the end of August, 180,000 or 60% of the 300,000 premises from the original agreement were passed.<\/p><p>An additional 21,000 premises have also now been passed.  This takes the number of properties that can be connected to high-speed broadband specifically in rural areas to over 200,000.  When the programme is fully complete in the middle of next year we will see 300 business parks, over 1,000 schools, over 28,000 farms and over 47,000 small businesses passed with high-speed future-proofed fibre technology.<\/p><p> The properties and areas included in the original investment were notified to the Department before the programme commenced and properties that were not deemed to be in an area that could be served on a commercial basis were subsequently included in the State intervention area to be served by the national broadband plan.<\/p><p> Eir's fibre investment, which is unmatched in scale and scope in the market, is opening up new opportunities for citizens and rural communities across the country.  It is clear Eir's investment is making a difference for Ireland.  Recent data from the European Court of Auditors showed that the availability of high-speed broadband in Ireland has increased from just over 30% of the population in 2011 to more than 90% in 2017, an improvement bested only by Italy in Europe and delivered almost entirely due to Eir's fibre investment.  The European Commission's Digital Economy and Society Index 2018 ranks Ireland sixth in Europe, up three places from 2017.  In fact, Ireland belongs to the higher performing cluster of countries.  I am extremely proud of the dedication of all our staff, whose efforts have transformed the lives of the 635,000 families and businesses that now have high-speed fibre broadband.<\/p><p> All that being said, I understand the public's concern, and members' concerns, that the delivery of broadband in Ireland will not be solved until every person who needs a high-speed connection can get one.  I have travelled around the country and heard directly from those who are waiting for broadband.  Eir also processes on average 50 representations a week from Deputies, Senators, councillors and broadband officers in local authorities and three quarters of those queries we receive relate to those looking for high-speed broadband.  I am acutely aware of the demands that are out there.<\/p><p> I will talk about the importance of the national broadband plan in a moment.  However, members should recognise that as an open economy, and with the threat of Brexit looming over us, we need private sector investment to continue to keep Ireland competitive.  That is why Eir's shareholders have a strong appetite to invest in our network.  Our ambition is to be the best broadband and mobile provider in Ireland and our &euro;1 billion capital investment plan over the next five years, we believe, will be the largest privately funded investment programme in Ireland over the period.  This will bring fibre-to-the-home technology to 1.4 million homes outside of the national broadband plan State intervention area and the programme will employ 1,000 people during deployment.<\/p><p> I am sure that members have heard stories from their constituents and friends and examples where Eir's customer service has not been up to scratch.  I have heard those stories too and I take them very seriously.  I read every complaint that is sent in to me and I am determined to change fundamentally the way we interact with our customers.<\/p><p> Members will have seen the decision we took last week to change our customer care model from outsourced services provided by HCL to insourcing this work to Eir employees.  By investing in new IT systems and by bringing customer care back in-house - with good customer contact jobs - to a new centre in Sligo as well as in Limerick and Cork, we hope to dramatically improve our customer service.<\/p><p> These investment programmes, in infrastructure, IT and staff, will improve significantly the lives and connectivity of the people of Ireland.  It will mean more opportunities for remote working, for ehealth, for online education and for home entertainment, as well as offering increased opportunities for small businesses.<\/p><p> Ireland has among the most dispersed of populations and has the highest proportions of rural dwellers in Europe.  Some 42% of Irish people live in rural areas compared with an EU average of 27%.  This reality, coupled with the geography of our environment, poses an enormous challenge to Eir in making the business case for further fibre network investment in more remote areas where costs would be prohibitive.  Eir recognises the need, therefore, for the national broadband plan, NBP.<\/p><p> In January this year, Eir took the difficult decision to withdraw from the bidding process for the national broadband plan.  Eir had invested over &euro;7 million in the bid and on a personal level, I can assure the committee arriving at that position was very disappointing.  However, as a commercial organisation, we could no longer proceed.<\/p><p> Despite leaving the bidding process, Eir continues to be highly engaged in the process as a provider of pole-and-duct infrastructure access to the remaining bidder and has spent significant time and resources to help the Enet consortium.  At every juncture, Eir has been an active participant and supporter of successive Governments' plans to promote broadband availability across Ireland.  Eir will continue to support Government initiatives where it can and Eir is working closely with Enet to support its NBP bid.<\/p><p> We have made substantial progress in recent years, delivering high-speed broadband to 75% of the homes and businesses in Ireland from a standing start in 2012 and investing &euro;1.5 billion in our network over the past five years, but the transformation of Eir is not complete.  We need to continually improve the experience we deliver to our customers and continue to transform Ireland into a global leader in high-speed communications technology.  Our objective is to provide the best mobile and broadband network in the country and we are embarking on a &euro;1 billion nationwide investment programme over the next five years to make that a reality.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  We look forward to taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537286400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lennon.

I myself might start with a few questions.<\/p><p>What are Eir's future plans regarding the significant issues that were self-disclosed under the regulatory governance model procedures and what will the company do to tackle them in the future?  The committee is aware of the Styles report.  While voluntary disclosure is good, would Ms Lennon agree there needs to be mandatory disclosure to give more confidence to the market?  There are five compliance cases before the courts.  We cannot talk about individual cases but all of this litigation does not instill confidence for the market or for future investment.  I refer to the timeframes around that and ask Ms Lennon if she could comment in general on the impact that is having on the market.<\/p><p>When one compares wholesale broadband connection prices, Eir's price is several hundred per cent higher than the EU average broadband connection price.  Can Ms Lennon explain why it is so high?  With SIRO, for example, a connection costs &euro;70.  It costs &euro;272 for Eir.  I read in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>of a bespoke cost of &euro;500 given for a service connection charge and Ms Lennon might explain that also.<\/p><p>In respect of ComReg, does Ms Lennon believe that it has adequate powers to regulate the market?<\/p><p>As for the roll-out of broadband, I hear from my constituency office in respect of a number of new estates that there seems to be a slowdown in the roll-out of broadband.

There are many more such examples of newer estates that are being impacted due to the essential roll-out of broadband in rural areas.

As she will be aware, some of her customers, those who use Eir's wholesale services, were previously before the committee and they outlined for us their, as it were, gripes.  Our role, as I see it anyway, is not to get involved in that level of detail - that is always understandable - but where it cascades out to our role is in terms of the value for money the citizen gets in terms of the service that is provided to him or her.  Any impediment that is introduced that reduces competition forces the end price up for the user.<\/p> <p>  My concern follows on from that the Chair has identified.  The representative body, the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators, ALTO, was before us and set out clearly its concerns about the costs.  There are some questions for Eir but there are also some questions for the regulatory regime.  It is highly unlikely that Ms Lennon will be look for more regulation, which is an issue for us, but there is concern about the way Eir interfaces with the regulator.  The Chairman has already asked those questions.  I will not go back over those but I would be interested to hear Ms Lennon's response.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has already talked about the size and scale of the connection charges, particularly in that area where Eir agreed with the Government that arrangement about the roll-out to 300,000, which is now 330,000.  The Chairman identified the connection prices that Open Eir will charge its competitors to get on there and it seems to be out of kilter considerably with the way other markets deal with it.  The knock-on effect of anything that limits the capacity of those companies to invest is that the least good service gets to the consumer at the end of the day at too high a price.  Obviously, we want to try and get to the bottom of that.  It is very much about price and encouraging competition.  It is accepted now that it is highly unlikely that the arrangement Eir had with the Government, while presented as a commercially viable entity, would be commercially viable were it not for the fact that there will be a national broadband plan.<\/p><p>Eir spotted an opportunity and it invested the money, which is fantastic, but it will reap significant returns.  Eir is working with Enet now.  This might be news to them but a few hours ago, the Minster confirmed in the D&aacute;il that Enet is no longer the bidder.  Its partner, Granahan McCourt Capital, is one of the bidders while John Laing PLC has pulled out.  There have been more developments in that sordid affair and we will see how that progresses.  Regardless, it is fair to say that the arrangement that Eir reached with the Government to roll broadband out to 300,000 premises has taken out much of the competition.  Eir decided to pull out of the national broadband plan and SIRO pulled out because it looked like Eir would have such coverage that no one else could see a financial return for themselves.  That puts more pressure on the Open Eir part of the business to be open and transparent about how it does business so that we, on behalf of the people who put us here, can be assured that there is good, open competition.  However, there cannot be because Eir has the infrastructure and, therefore, competition must be generated through the regulatory regime.  We will listen to Eir's views on this.  We may not take these views at face value, understanding the commercial realities that exist, but it is a concern.  The less investment that other companies make, ultimately, the less the consumer will benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#F00300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537286400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Lennon and Mr. Healy.

I realise it is no longer in the tender but it is trying to service properties.<\/p> <p> Regarding the roll-out, Naas is one of many places in the light blue area on the tender maps where Eir proposed to tackle commercially rather than being part of the tender.  I am familiar with some properties that come up as being light blue but when one follows up on them, they are not connected.  While this does not happen overnight but what percentage of properties have been connected?  Is there a completion date?  Is Eir confident that 99% of properties will be complete by February 2019 or whatever the date is?  I am keen to get those dates and that status.<\/p> <p>  Eir is no longer involved in the tender.  However, it seems that the amber areas of the map, which were in the intervention area, are standing still.  I have constituents in those areas.  I do not hold Eir responsible for the tender which is a different ball game now.  However, not only is the tender happening any time soon, but these people do not have access to much maintenance.  They are not getting the bog standard service enhancements and offers or basic maintenance that might bring them from 2GB to 4GB or 5GB.  They are not at 30GB or 100GB yet, but they might have 1GB or 2GB, or have different solutions in place.  What level of maintenance is Eir engaged in for the rural network in intervention areas where it has existing customers?  They might be wholesale customers with a different product.  Has Eir walked away from the amber areas altogether or is it servicing those customers and trying to do some upgrades along the way?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the points made by Deputy Dooley and the Chairman.  I have observed the relationship between Eir and the other telecom companies and ComReg in recent times.  It appears that Eir has a somewhat more litigious attitude or approach than the others.  This is typified by article 19 of the access directive.  ComReg made a decision to impose administrative sanctions and Eir's corporate approach was to counter sue and bring it through the courts.  My understanding is that the legal argument was that the State did not properly transpose the directive.  That may be so and it is costing the State money.  I understand that a commercial company must make its own decisions but while that may be the letter of the law, it is not the spirit of the law.  I am questioning the thinking there and those kinds of challenges.  Eir must also take a bet that the costs will be less than the &euro;10 million by the time it comes out or it will have lost money through the challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#G00500","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537286400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I will begin with the questions asked by Deputy Dooley and the Chairman on ALTO and the connection charges.  ALTO has a number of members.  If one looks at what is said by the various groups, the companies that invest in infrastructure such as SIRO and Virgin have a similar view to Eir's, which is that to invest in infrastructure and to commit to spending &euro;1.5 billion as we have over the past five years and a further &euro;1 billion over the next five years requires a certain degree of regulatory predictability and certainty.  For private investors to put that kind of money into any country, they need to generate a certain level of return.  ComReg has two main roles.  One is to promote investment in infrastructure, because everyone wants to be able to connect to these networks, and the other is to drive competition.  The companies which spend money on infrastructure want an environment for infrastructure investment to be created, and those who do not spend on infrastructure talk about competition.  It is not a case of one size fits all for ALTO, however.  I know that when its representatives appeared before the committee, many of the messages that emerged related to competition.<\/p> <p>  On the connection charge, ALTO did not compare apples with apples.  They compared urban connection charges with rural connection charges.  In the UK, the cost to connect a rural house to BT is between &pound;500 and &pound;550.  There are competitors, one of which charges &pound;250.  In urban areas, the vast majority of connections are standard.  When technicians go to a house, they experience the same level of drop, they will be going into a duct and the process is predictable and standard.  Unfortunately, in rural areas, connections are not standard.  What we now find is that the first time a technician visits a house is almost like a recce of what has to be done.  Do we need to put a pole in?  Do trees need to be trimmed?  What will we have to do about cable?  The cost of connecting a rural house, on average, is &euro;450, because almost every connection is unique.  The cost of a pole is &euro;600.  Many rural connections require the erection of a pole.  That is the reality.  Comparing the SIRO connection charge in urban and semi-urban areas with a connection in rural Ireland is not fair.  Our connection cost is &euro;450 whereas we charge &euro;270.  The connection charge reply did not compare apples with apples and it certainly did not compare like for like.  Building networks in rural Ireland is expensive.  The technology is not difficult.  Splicing fibre and putting two pieces of fibre together is not difficult but being in 100 different parts of the country every day, making sure that the route is prepped, the traffic is managed, the trees are trimmed and that it is not bird nesting season, and everything works is what makes it difficult and slow.  When it comes to connecting a property, that is what makes it expensive.  I defend our position on our connection charges because they are considerably less than it costs us to connect customers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1537286400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>What is Eir's amortization period for connection costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#G00800","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537286400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>We charge &euro;270 upfront and probably amortize the remaining cost over ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537286400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>It is over 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gary Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1537286400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Over 20 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#G01100","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537286400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Yes, it is over 20 years.<\/p><p>All these costs have been discussed with ComReg.

The cost we charge for a pole or for access to a duct is built up from a model that sets out the cost to maintain a duct and pole network in rural Ireland.  Our pricing model applies across the entire country, so one is averaging the cost.  It is more expensive in rural Ireland but we have a bigger overhead network in rural areas compared to in urban areas.<\/p> <p>  In terms of ComReg's powers of governance, Eir voluntarily signed up to a voluntary regulatory governance model and as part of that we agreed to a review of every product we had no matter how old or how few customers were on it and we would check it for equivalence, that is where we treat wholesale customers exactly the same as retail customers and for non-discrimination and we would review all the customers and we would share with ComReg the output of that review and then we would generate a report and share it with industry.  We signed up to do that and we hired some consultants to help us and we spent a great deal of money and time and effort to get this done and as we finished a product, we sent all our reports into ComReg.  ComReg was well aware of the progress we were making and what we were finding.  Once we had it all done, we did find discrepancies but these did not arise because people deliberately decided to discriminate one against another.  Let me give a good example, we found a discrepancy that some retail faults were being repaired quicker than wholesale faults.  We were looking to see what was driving that and what we discovered was the retail business had decided to extend the opening hours of their contact centre, which meant that a retail customer would report it for a longer period.  All the communications go into the same hopper in the morning but because they were being taken in later they were first into the hopper.  It was not a case of somebody waking up and deciding to discriminate against wholesale customers, but doing something that he or she thought was for the benefit of customers and not thinking through the process and possible knock-on effects.  <\/p> <p>  We found there were changes in processes in this period.  Many issues related to older products.  We reported them in the Stiles report, as mentioned, and the reaction of industry was astonishing.  Industry did not acknowledge that we were being transparent and that we fixed all the issues raised and there were additional issues to be fixed.  Instead industry said that it was disgraceful and this set off the review of our regulatory governance model.  We have been working with ComReg in the past 12 months, in particular in the past three to four months to understand those requirements, to document what we do and make changes where we need to.  For example the Open Eir team is incentivised only on Open Eir deliverables and not on anything to do with the retail or group side of the business.  We are moving buildings in the next month or so and the Open Eir team will be in different buildings.  Before reaching the final agreement with ComReg we are starting to implement those changes.  Eir made a voluntary decision to engage in the process and to be transparent.  I remember talking to the industry at the time and saying that we were always going to find something, some of these products have been there for years and some have a small number of customers on them.  Things have changed over time.  Nobody is deliberately trying to discriminate but there are definitely going to be idiosyncrasies or changes and what we vow is that we will find them, that we will be transparent, we will report them and we will fix them.  That is pretty much what we did.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley in particular asked about the 300,000.  I hate to be reminding people of the background, the Department approached every operator at the time, stating that it wished to finalise a map and wanted to know if they had any plans to do more building in rural Ireland.  A number of operators, including ourselves, came forward and outlined their plans, but the reality is that the only operator that spent its own money, some &euro;250 million to reach 330,000 homes, businesses and farms in rural Ireland was Eir.  To say that is the cause of other people dropping out is something that I challenge.  SSE became a partner in the Enet consortium well after the 300,000 was already gone and left the consortium.  It is easy to say that people left because of the 300,000 but the reality is that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1537286400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>The question is whether Eir would be doing the 300,000 if there was no national broadband plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#H00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537286400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>We actually would.

We were faster and at the end it was cheaper than we had thought because when we got to do it, our ducts were in better shape than we thought and we went further with the money we had.   We were coming to the end of that and had to decide where to go next.  Because we had been involved in mechanical, electrical and process design, MEP, we were looking at solutions for rural Ireland; we had it broken down into commercial opportunities, and there was a commercial opportunity in the next 100,000 and so on.  We had all that work done.  When the Department asked us, we had a machine that was able to build networks, so we were not going to disband that machine, we were going to keep going and when that request came in, we strongly believed there was a commercial return to do another 300,000 homes and businesses at a cost of &euro;250 million.

We are a company that is the most regulated of all the companies in the sector.  Much of our focus is on trying to avoid situations where we are having to go to court.  I do not think that either ComReg or our company wants to go to court.  In our situation we are happy that ComReg has powers and needs to enforce those powers and use them but we would like to have a situation where we are not actually in court.  In a lot of cases, we find that we can resolve the issues among ourselves without going to court.  Having said that, what ComReg is looking at is around civil powers and having the power to set a fine itself without having to go to the courts and looking for a judge to do that.  We have some concerns around that because in terms of the cases that have been brought to us and which we have been brought to the High Court for, we believe that we have resolved those issues.  We brought them to the attention of ComReg in a number of cases and we resolved them very quickly.  The harm to the industry was very limited yet the level of fines that ComReg wanted to impose - and it would have gone through studies in trying to assess that - was very high.  We felt that was not the intention of the powers that ComReg had, and that is why the Article 19 case was brought.  I do not want to go into any more detail on that, because it has been discussed.  It was not the intention of Eir to find ourselves in court.  We want to have a well resourced regulator who is able to bring sanctions against operators who are not abiding by the rules.

The areas could be serviced commercially, it made sense from a commercial point of view because there was profit to be made.  Can Ms Lennon see the situation that leaves?  There are another 440,000 premises or households that need to be serviced and it is becoming increasingly precarious as to who will service them.  Does Ms Lennon believe that will require an even larger subsidy because 300,000 households have been removed and serviced?  There are 300,000 households that are commercially viable to service, as Eir is proving and that is the business it is in.  Will servicing the other 540,000 households and premises significantly increase the subsidy from the State or from the Exchequer?<\/p> <p>  Logistically, the ESB has a pole at every house but Eir has not.  On more and more houses I see going up, there is an ESB pole and an electricity cable but no phone cable going in.  Some of the pole network is in bad shape.  Is it Eir's intention to charge so much per pole to whoever the supplier is to rent that pole annually?  Would the fee be charged annually or on a ten-year basis?

I have had many complaints about that, some of which I have fed in to Eir, where there is a group of houses not far from the blue mark.  There might be another group within 600 m, 700 m or 800 m that can be commercially serviced.  I understand that wherever one stops, there always will be people who are outside that net.

If a service provider has a pole to itself, it costs &euro;20.  If there are two service providers on a pole, the cost is &euro;10 each.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right in making the point that there is not a pole connecting every house.  Many people have gone to mobile and never had a telecoms connection into their house which is not the case for the ESB because every house has electricity.<\/p><p>We raised the point numerous times during the minimum viable product, MVP, process that we should be using all infrastructure to get the best.  Why would we put up a pole when there is already a pole in the driveway that brings electricity in?  That is a question worth answering.  There is other infrastructure and it is not just Eir's infrastructure.  We should use whatever infrastructure is available to get the best service to customers and the best price for the State, so I agree.<\/p><p> On whether we need more regulation, it goes back to what I said earlier.  We feel that the regulator is focused on the competition side of regulation and not as focused on creating an environment for investment.  For example, most of our products, as I said, are regulated based on cost orientation, that is, the cost to maintain or build that product.  In most countries when rolling out fibre to the cabinet, cost orientation was introduced seven years afterwards because that is the kind of time that would be needed to roll out these networks and get a return on them.  In Ireland we went to cost orientation in four years.  When we had started our roll-out we never thought for a second we might be at cost orientation.  Again, when rolling out networks, it takes a while to understand what the actual costs are as one sees different set-ups, different connections and so on.  We feel we need to look more actively at regulation on the infrastructure side, create that environment for our infrastructure and be less focused on the competition.  One need only look at what has happened to market share over the past number of years.  This is the point that Gary made earlier about the damage to competitors.  It is ALTO's members who have grown their market share over the past number of years, not Eir retail.  That is the reality.  Sky was relatively new to the market three years ago and it has taken a decent amount of market share.  That says to me that on the competitive side it is working.  To be in cost orientation, however, four years after spending significant millions on a network feels too soon, and it is potentially a barrier to people investing in the country.<\/p><p> On the separation of wholesale, the committee probably knows the answer to this before I say it.  There is one country where there has been forced separation of wholesale and retail, and that is the UK.  That does not seem to have worked in terms of fibre penetration, or certainly rural fibre penetration.  We say we are sub-scale in Ireland to have a completely separate business.  If that is done, the cost of separate IT systems and so on will lead to higher prices because all of those costs will feed into our cost-orientated prices, which will impact on the consumer.  The things we are doing, such as separate incentives for the open-air team, separate buildings, green regulatory governance processes, reporting and so forth, are adequate.  Right across Europe there is no other example that I know of where wholesale has been successfully separated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#J02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537286400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I asked three questions about fibre in the home and how realistic it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018091800002#K00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537286400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Fibre to the home is absolutely the best longer-term solution.

In the first place, the way we have been doing it is by bringing core fibre out into the country in advance of this in order that we can connect back to it.  We planned from where we had core fibre out.  We could have made a decision to do much more of Munster or all of Connacht but we said we would do it from core fibre out.  Back in the office we did a high level design and when we got out on the ground we did our low level design.  While doing that, when it made sense we scooped more people in, or we looked at requests and said it really is close so we will do it, but people often say that is just 50 m or a mile and a half.
