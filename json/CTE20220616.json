Apologies have been received from the Chair, Deputy Stanley, and from Deputies Alan Kelly, Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, James O'Connor and Colm Burke.  Please note that in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public hearings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, with representatives from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, HSE, to examine the board's 2020 financial statements.  As per the committee's request, the board has provided some information on contractual provisions and claims in respect of the national paediatric hospital, which the committee may wish to examine during the engagement.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, financial manager.<\/p><p>We are also joined by Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary in the health infrastructure division at the Department of Health, and by Mr. Martin McKeith, assistant lead director of the children's hospital project and programme at the HSE.<\/p><p> As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p><p> Before we start, I want to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way that will make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> Before we move to opening statements, I want to address a worrying trend that has been developing in terms of a lack of engagement and an apparent disregard by certain bodies of accountability to the Oireachtas.  The vast majority of bodies engage in an open and professional way with the committee, and that is right and proper.  This is not out of respect for any members of the committee but out of respect for the Oireachtas.  Members of the Houses represent the taxpayer who foot the bill for public bodies' expenditure and the accountability of public bodies to the Oireachtas is a fundamental cornerstone of the democracy in which we live.<\/p><p> Mr. Gunning, you are accountable to the Oireachtas for the board's expenditure and this committee is charged by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with examining that expenditure and reporting to the D&aacute;il.  In order to do so in an informed manner, we request information in advance of meetings.  I understand the invitation to the board to attend this meeting issued on 11 May.  We requested updates on previous recommendations of this committee to the board to be provided by last Friday, 10 June.  To any reasonable person, I think this was a reasonable timeframe.  Not only was the information not provided within the timeframe, despite the secretariat following up on a number of occasions, the board waited until 10 June to respond and to say that two of the requests were more appropriate to the Department rather than flagging this in May or liaising with the Department to provide the committee with the information.  We are still awaiting the updates to the recommendations made by the committee relating to the board, which were requested on 11 May for this meeting.<\/p><p> The committee also requested other information on contractual provisions and claims on 30 May with a request for a response by 10 June.  That information was not provided until late on 14 June and even then, it was presented very poorly, with parts of the information missing and no explanation provided to the committee for the missing information.  We also did not receive Mr. Gunning's opening statement, which was requested at least 24 hours before this meeting, until 9 p.m last night.  This level of engagement on your part is clearly unsatisfactory.  Speaking on behalf of the committee, I trust that in the future, there will be a significant improvement.<\/p><p> I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#A00400","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655368200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  As members are aware, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is responsible for the planning, design, construction and fit-out of the new children's hospital at the St. James's Campus, together with the construction of two associate paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres, located at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  A number of parallel projects, outside the remit of the board, will be required to transfer staff and services into the new facilities and to get them into operation.  These are being progressed by Children's Health Ireland which will operate the services in the new facilities in the future.  The overall budget approved by Government in December 2018 to get the hospital and both satellite centres up and running was &euro;1.7 billion.  The budget available to the board for the physical development and equipping of the hospital and the satellite centres amounts to &euro;1.4 billion.  The budget for the parallel Children's Health Ireland projects is &euro;300 million.  The board is funded by Oireachtas grants provided via the Health Service Executive.  In 2020, the grant funding provided amounted to &euro;161.2 million, matched to an equivalent expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Up to the end of 2020, the board had spent a total of &euro;621 million on design, construction and administration costs.  The costs associated with the development and equipping of the Blanchardstown unit, which became operational in 2019, amounted to just under &euro;37 million.  The Blanchardstown assets were transferred to the Health Service Executive and to Children's Health Ireland.  The remaining cumulative expenditure - a net &euro;584 million - is recognised as the value of the fixed assets in development in the board's statement of financial position.<\/p> <p>  The final outturn on the project will depend on a number of factors.  As members are aware, one of the main issues is the finalisation of contractor claims for additional payment over the original contract value.  Note 11 to the financial statements discloses that the board has been notified of many such claims by the main contractor, and additional information in that regard has been supplied in correspondence.  Note 11 also outlines the structures in place for the resolution of claims, including determination by the employer's representative or a project board, through conciliation, or ultimately if required, in the courts.  As such claims are settled between the board and the main contractor, their impact is reflected in payments and-or in the capital commitments outstanding at the year end, recorded in Note 8.  This note indicates that, excluding lease commitments on the board's office accommodation, the value of the capital commitments outstanding at the end of 2020 stood at &euro;764 million, and that was down &euro;110 million on the level outstanding at the end of 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I will have to take it away and take note of it to consider how we can do better to fulfil these particular requirements.  I have given a commitment that we will do that.<\/p> <p>  I will continue with the opening statement.  I thank the committee for inviting the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to assist it in its examination of our 2020 financial statements.  I am the chief officer of the NPHDB and I am joined by Mr. Phelim Devine, Dr. Emma Curtis, our medical director, and Mr. Jim Farragher, our financial manager.  The NPHDB was appointed by the Minister for Health in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children's hospital on a campus shared with St. James's Hospital, a paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly and a paediatric outpatient and emergency care centre at Tallaght.  Both outpatient centres have been handed over to Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and are fully operational.<\/p> <p>  The new children's hospital project represents a unique and unprecedented investment in children's and young people's health and well-being and will deliver on the vision of creating one of the finest children's hospital in the world.  This much-needed investment will enable the delivery of expert care and treatment for all children and young people - who represent 25% of our population - from a bespoke, modern space.  It will have world-class, state-of-the-art facilities where paediatricians, doctors, nurses, clinicians and all medical and support staff will deliver care leading to better health outcomes for all.<\/p><p> Progress on the construction of the new children's hospital has advanced significantly since we were last here with the committee almost 12 months ago.  The facility is now 70% complete and is well established on the city's skyline.  I thank the members of the committee who visited the site over the past year.  The advanced progress means the layout the hospital is clear and visible to all those who walk through the various departments that are starting to reach completion.  On behalf of the development board, I extend an invitation to each of the members to visit the hospital to see the progress first-hand.<\/p><p> The committee can see from the images that accompany this statement that the hospital is progressing, with the most advanced areas having intact floors, walls, ceilings and joinery such as nurse stations already installed.  The intensive care unit, ICU, pendants that hold all medical equipment, along with bathroom fittings, are being installed, as are the sliding doors with the interstitial privacy lines.  The fitting out of ceilings, walls and glazed screens within the concourse at all levels of the north and south entrances is well under way, including the cone structures that host the third-level seminar and library spaces, the 350-seat lecture theatre, caf&eacute;s and an all-faith centre, as well as the performance steps.<\/p><p> As the committee can see from the images, the 22 operating theatres' ceilings, walls and floor fit-out is under way, with medical equipment already being installed.  Other areas, such as the emergency department, imaging, critical care and therapy areas are progressing at pace.  The clinical rooms and bedrooms with windows to the gardens with views to the Dublin mountains and Phoenix Park are all there to be viewed.  It is not hard to imagine the voices of children and families as we navigate the corridors.  As we move to complete the final 30%, we are moving quickly to the completion of finishes.  It is expected that the first rooms will be completed in August this year and will be ready for system commissioning.  The other 4,600 clinical rooms will follow in a planned sequence.<\/p><p> It is worth reminding the committee that at the heart of this infrastructure project is the policy commitment to co-locate the children&rsquo;s hospital with an acute adult hospital and, in time, tri-location with a maternity hospital.  Critical pieces of infrastructure linking these facilities are the shared logistics and service yard, the facilities management tunnel linking to the St. James&rsquo;s adult hospital and the future maternity hospital and the shared helipad and ambulance canopy, which will optimise access for patients, staff and services.<\/p><p> The medical and clinical equipping of the hospital that also falls within our remit is advancing.  Medical equipment, such as theatre and ICU pendants, autoclaves and storage and catering equipment are already being installed.  The clinical decontamination unit, which cleans and sterilises the surgical equipment, has been procured, as have the automated guided vehicles that will traverse the segregated facility management lifts and corridors 24 hours a day to deliver and collect various medical materials and products vital to deliver hospital operations.  Three MRI machines have been procured to accompany two that will transfer from the existing hospitals.  The process to buy computed tomography, CT, scanners, biplane imaging for theatres, X-rays, fluoroscopy, dental chairs, etc., will be completed next month.  Over the next 12 months, the board will execute multiple contracts with several specialist vendors for this equipment.<\/p><p> I will speak to the expenditure for 2020 and 2021.  The 2020 accounts have been audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I will not go through the expenditure because it has been covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the interests of time, I will move to the final comments.<\/p><p> On the question of wider construction challenges, it is widely acknowledged that the global construction sector is facing challenges related to supply of market essentials due to widespread turbulence in the industry caused by Brexit, Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine.  All of these have led to production disruption, Covid-related factory shutdowns, import delays and constraints and inventory depletion, resulting in increased global demand and shortages in the market.  According to the SCSI\/PwC 2022 Construction Market Monitor, the top three factors indicated by surveyors as affecting firms' activity levels were shortage of labour, shortage of materials and project viability.  This is a global challenge not unique to the construction sector but one that is having - and will continue to have - potential impacts on this project while also bringing additional uncertainty.  The contractor continues to work through these challenges.<\/p><p> With respect to the construction timeline, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and BAM remain fully aligned around reaching substantial completion of the hospital by the end of January 2024, with the hospital then being handed over to Children's Hospital Ireland for a period of commissioning.  There are, however, a number of factors that put pressure on this forecasted timeframe so we continue to work with the contractor to understand what implications these external factors may have on the programme, and as a result the contractor's programme is under constant review and evaluation.<\/p><p> On the question of construction costs, in December 2018, the Government approved an investment of &euro;1.433 billion for the design, build and equipping of the children's hospital project.  This investment excludes items where no price certainty is possible due to factors such as construction inflation, statutory changes and other changes in project scope that may arise over the course of construction.  In addition to these factors, programme delay, Covid-19 and Brexit will all bring additional cost to the project.  It is not possible to provide a final estimated cost at this time for the completion of the project but the combination of all these factors means that the final amount will be above that already approved by the Government.  In particular, the current period of high inflation is inevitably having a major impact on costs for a project of this scale, which remains the largest current infrastructure development in the State.<\/p><p> On a project of this scale and complexity, any delay has a cost implication.  There is ongoing engagement taking place to determine the implication of all contributing factors to the costs.  Any speculation or discussion on what these additional costs might be could potentially compromise the existing contractual arrangements with the contractor and jeopardise the development board's ability to negotiate on behalf of the State.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and stakeholders will continue to work together to ensure any additional funding that is required and requested is appropriate and justified.  The development board will also continue to vigorously review any claims for additional moneys and only those that are deemed appropriate will be paid.<\/p><p> Claims and disputes are an inevitable part of construction projects of this scale.  They arise for myriad reasons and given the large amounts of money involved, it is imperative that the development board evaluates each claim and robustly defends those that are not justified.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has a comprehensive process in place for the assessment of claims and has extensive project controls to help manage costs.  While management of this is consuming by way of cost and time, the processes ultimately help to manage and defend costs so that the project can reach the best possible outcomes.<\/p><p> In 2021, a moratorium agreed between the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the main contractor was applied on disputes, including on conciliations and adjudications and High Court proceedings.  This moratorium was designed to allow both parties to concentrate on delivering the project in the shortest possible timeframe and is ongoing.  Information on claims and adjustment management and dispute management has been provided to the committee separately, as per the template requested by the committee.<\/p><p> Progress on the construction of the new children&rsquo;s hospital has progressed significantly in the past 12 months.  This progress is evident in the new structure and building that is emerging in Dublin 8 and the visible impact on the Dublin skyline.  There is 70% of the construction work now complete.  The progress that has been made on the new hospital is in addition to the successful completions of both CHI at Connolly and CHI at Tallaght, both of which are an important part of the overall national children's hospital project.<\/p><p> We continue to ensure our stakeholders are informed on progress and challenges.  We remain engaged with the contractor, constantly assessing the potential implications of the wider construction sector challenges so that they can be mitigated where possible.  The project has encountered delays, some of which are inevitable for major infrastructure developments of this scale and others unprecedented, as I outlined.  However, all parties remain committed to delivering substantial completion of the new children's hospital within the shortest possible timeframe.  I will end by repeating my invitation and that of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to all committee members to visit or revisit the hospital site and view first-hand the state-of-the-art facility that is emerging and will serve children and their families for generations to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I understand Mr. Tierney wishes to make an opening statement on behalf of the Department.

I also thank the committee for extending the invitation to the HSE and I welcome my colleague from the HSE, Mr. McKeith, assistant lead director for the children's hospital programme.  The HSE plays a vital role in the national children's hospital, NCH, project and this is reaffirmed by the new roles of lead director and assistant lead director emanating from the recommendations of the 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report, including new governance and oversight arrangements, as approved by the Government.<\/p> <p>  Under the ministerial order that established the development board in 2007, the board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require, and to additionally submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2020 were submitted to the Department on 6 December 2021, following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s audit.  They were then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 December 2021, pursuant to section 11 of the 1993 Act.<\/p> <p>  The board receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE, as the sanctioning body for the new children&rsquo;s hospital programme.  As set out in the 2020 financial statements, costs of &euro;161.2 million were incurred by the board in 2020.  Costs incurred by the board in the preceding year were &euro;199.6 million.  The board&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2021 will be submitted to the Minister following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas following an internal review by the Department.  The development board has advised the Department that future financial statements will include a note that details the additional costs paid to date that are not included in the approved budget of &euro;1.4 billion as well as a note that indicates the overall claims received by the employer's representative and the current stage that they are at in the dispute management processes.  This is on foot of recommendations from this committee's report, published on 8 March 2022, following the examination of the 2019 financial statements.  The development board has also committed to attaching a monetary value to resolved claims to show any impact they may have on the overall cost and providing a quarterly report to the committee on both open and settled claims.  This approach is also welcomed by the Department.<\/p> <p>  Regarding progress on the project, the new children&rsquo;s hospital project remains the most significant capital investment programme undertaken in the healthcare system in Ireland.  It will play a key role in strategic reform for paediatric services and is fully aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is already delivering in terms of the two satellite centres that are open and delivering the new model of ambulatory care for children in the greater Dublin area.  The project and programme will deliver world-class facilities that will improve and prioritise medical outcomes for the nation's sickest children while bringing about transformational change to the delivery of healthcare for the children of Ireland for generations to come.<\/p> <p>  The construction project is only one part of three interrelated elements of the NCH programme for the delivery of a new paediatric model of care in Ireland, the others being the ICT and electronic health record infrastructure and the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals.  Despite unprecedented challenges and uncertainty that have not only delayed this project but also affected the wider construction industry, broader sectors and the general economy, it is important to acknowledge the great progress that has been made on the project.  My colleagues from the board have provided information and images in this regard.  As I noted earlier, the satellite centres, the paediatric outpatient and emergency care centre in Tallaght Hospital and the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital, are now successfully delivering the new model of ambulatory and urgent care for children and adolescents in the greater Dublin area.  In the opening statement I provided to the committee last night I have given some operational and service details which I will not go into now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of project risks, in its latest programme the construction contractor is now forecasting a substantial completion date of end of January 2024.  The development board is therefore focused on ensuring that everything possible is being done to ensure the construction project is completed as soon as possible.  However, there remain risks beyond the control of the development board and the contractor to the timeline arising from the disruption to just-in-time supply chains arising from Brexit and the global Covid-19 pandemic over the last two years.  More recently, the war in Ukraine has given and will continue to give rise to global economic uncertainty and supply chain disruption along with the effect on shortages of construction raw materials.  It is right that the development board might have concerns about the risks to the construction works, especially in respect of the risks I have just mentioned.  Furthermore, the wider construction industry is challenged by these same supply chain issues and price increases and the NCH project cannot alone be immune to these external risks.  I also set out in my statement some of the mitigating actions taken to date by the development board and the contractor, as well as the impact of current high inflationary pressures on the contract and the impact that has on the budget.<\/p> <p>  The hardly predictable course of the pandemic, recent geopolitical events and the consequent uncertainty make speculation and precise definitive forecasting of time and costs, hypothetical or otherwise, at this time very challenging, may also prejudice enforcement of the existing live contract and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the board in its ongoing confidential commercial engagement with the main contractor, including its responsibilities for ensuring timely completion of the construction works.  The development board continues to monitor and respond to the risks to cost and timelines and to administer the contract as mandated by the Government.  Nevertheless, reflecting on the positives, we now have paediatric outpatient and urgent care being delivered at Connolly Hospital, outpatient and emergency care being delivered at Tallaght Hospital and a site at St. James's Hospital that is visibly progressing towards construction completion.  As mentioned by Mr. Gunning, if members of the committee have not yet had an opportunity to visit the site, I would be happy to facilitate a site visit through the development board and Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  It is only when one sees the facility in person that one gets a full appreciation of the scale, vision and difference that this new hospital will make for the lives of children, their families and our healthcare professionals in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tierney"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Our lead speaker today is Deputy McAuliffe, who will have 15 minutes.

They looked at leveraging lessons learnt in the context of the UK.  At that time there were lessons learnt from guidance issued by the UK Cabinet Office through its Government construction strategy in May 2011.  That identified collaborative working as the optimal arrangement for megaproject delivery.  The construction of terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport was one of the key case studies as a prime example of collaborative working between the partners.  It was determined at that time the standard capital works management framework and the procurement model would not be appropriate, so that included the Government's own construction committee within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The procurement model adopted was based on a two-stage contracting arrangement that embraced the principle of collaboration through early contractor involvement and aligned with EU procurement requirements and also closely followed established construction contract forms.<\/p><p>Following deliberation and the presentation of the proposed option to the Government's construction contracts committee, the conclusion was a two-stage project on a collaborative form or model using the public works contract in a modified form which included an embedded risk-sharing mechanism.  As the Deputy rightly points out, the Government has realised that the residual risk of inflation in this environment is not tenable, viable or sustainable for the construction industry.  It has issued at least two policy responses for entities such as mine that are in tender and trying to entice a market to engage and for contracts that have already been set using a public works contract model where the contractor is taking all the risk on inflation and has introduced an embedded risk-sharing mechanism on a collaborative basis.<\/p><p> To answer the question directly, we will continue to engage through the Government construction contracts committee to ensure that in any future projects the right procurement strategy and the right model or form of contract is put in place.  There is a broader discussion at the moment around a revision of the public works contract by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  I cannot comment on that at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#E06100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tierney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I think I am out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#F00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I think I am next on the list.

The reason I ask is that we are in a new situation, one that was not envisaged last year when this committee and the general public were exercised by the potential cost overrun of this.  We now have building inflation that by all accounts will exceed 4%, possibly by a substantial amount.  I listened to the earlier exchange and I want to get an understanding of the premise on which that inflation figure will be calculated.  As I understand it, three metrics are used.

There are a number of indices published.  One can pick up consultant reports that give all sorts of forecasts but the contract specifies three specific ones.  The first is the Linesight construction inflation report, the second is the AECOM construction industry report and the third is the Society for Chartered Surveyors of Ireland inflation report.  Those reports are retrospective and look back at the previous year.  An average of those three is used to determine the number that is applied to the contract.  Let us say the number was 10%.  In that case, we would take away the 4%, which is at the contractor's risk, and that number goes into that compounding formula that goes from year to year to calculate the interest.  That is the practical way it was worked out.  We have to assess that by the end of June of any particular year and make the relevant payment to the contractor for the previous year in the July payment.

The Department of Health, the HSE and hospital board are accountable to the Oireachtas, but nothing in the engagements we get suggests any recognition of the importance of that.  They have refused to provide documents to this committee.  The people who are overseeing a substantial infrastructure project, in this case a children's hospital, are unable to say well over halfway through the project what they think the final cost will be, and have refused even to provide an estimate.

It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  Deputy Matt Carthy flagged this item for discussion but he is not here right now.  He may wish to raise it a future meeting so we will hold it over until then.<\/p> <p>  The next flagged correspondence is No. 1272 B from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General, Department of Justice, dated 24 May 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department of Justice on 28 April 2022.  There was a back and forth discussion about where responsibility lay.  Regarding question No. 3 and non-compliant contracts that have been running for longer than five years, I suggest that we request clarity as to whether the four non-compliant contracts referenced continue to be rolled over or are now in compliance.  Essentially, responsibility moved from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Apparently responsibility transfers with the files so we cannot ask for further input from the Department of Justice but the Secretary General of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth could be asked to clarify the rationale for finding the contracts were non-compliant.  It would be useful to do that.  Apart from anything else, this is probably likely to happen again if there is a change in remit and it would be useful to build a bit of institutional memory in relation to how that works and how that conclusion was reached.  <\/p> <p>  Question No. 7 included a request for sight of the valuations relating to the Thornton Hall site but this request is not addressed in the reply.  It is proposed to reiterate the request for sight of the valuations themselves.  Similarly, question No. 13 is not answered.  We requested the recommended number of domestic violence refuge beds in the State, as per the Istanbul Convention, and how it compares to the current number of such beds in the State but no such information is given.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence and to request further information as outlined.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I flagged this item along with Deputy Carthy.  On question No. 5, I got a reply from the Department recently that relates to this.  I received a reply on 1 June having sought the information more than a year ago.  The information is quite useful.  For example, the estimated outstanding liability related to the Irish Prison Service prisoner personal injury claims at 28 February 2021 was &euro;63 million.  Some of that is related to in-cell sanitation.  I am happy to provide this document to the committee.  There is no point in repeating all of it but we might just seek an update on it.  We can hold it over to next week and seek an update on it.  <\/p> <p>  On CCTV and local authorities, I think legislation is required.  I am referring to item six on page six of the reply, which relates to community-based CCTV grants.

It was welcome that all five of the committee recommendations were accepted.  The recommendations relate to the failure of the State to meet the greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy targets, sustainable energy programmes' expenditure; and the total cost of landfill remediation.  On the national broadband plan, this related to the failure of National Broadband Ireland to meet its targets for the roll-out of the national broadband plan and the need for the Department to develop an in-house expertise to reduce reliance on external consultants for advice relating to the national broadband plan contract.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Looking through some of this material, we may hold it as Deputy Carthy wished to come in on this item.  There is just one thing that it would be useful to go back to the Department on, namely, No. 6, on page 12 of the reply, which refers to progress to date on the separation of Irish Water from Ervia, where it states that Irish Water&rsquo;s borrowings are likely to be impacted by that separation.

I hate to add to our workload for next week but if it is a question that the Deputies are not here next week, we can move on from it.<\/p> <p>  The next category of correspondence is in category C, which is correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.<\/p> <p>  No. 1268C is from an individual on behalf of Louth Environmental Group dated 25 May 2022 and enclosing correspondence regarding funding for coastal greenways in Dundalk, County Louth.

Deputy Munster flagged that item and we will take the same approach as with other correspondence already referred to, if the committee is agreeable to that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, a number of further items of correspondence have been received in respect to the closure of Owenacurra Centre, County Cork, namely, Nos. 1277, 1280, 1287 and 1291.  Following receipt of correspondence on this matter last year, we wrote to the HSE and the matter was raised with this body when it appeared before the committee earlier this year. <\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Health has also previously advised that it was examining this issue and had visited the centre.  To avoid duplicating the work of that committee and because the decision to close the centre is a policy decision more appropriate to the remit of that committee, we did not consider the matter further.  While I understand that this is a terrible situation for some of the residents and their families, I am not sure that we can assist in any meaningful way in preventing the closure of the centre.  I will open the floor to any members who might wish to address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022061600002#CC01900","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I want to address this issue as I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Health and I will bring our committee here up to speed now on it.  The health committee looked at this issue in respect of the health impacts for those people, it met the HSE and, to be honest, got very little good out of that body on this.  This issue has now been referred to the HSE board for independent overview in respect of the impacts as they relate to health.<\/p> <p>  In the process of doing the work on Owenacurra, the committee has gathered into the discussion a significant amount of additional material around building and capital spending in the Cork area, when it comes to mental health facilities.  We are talking in the region of seven buildings now.  A piece of work has been done since this time last year around this issue, because it was announced in June or July.  There have been many freedom of information, FOI, requests and almost no information has been received through those FOI requests.<\/p><p>This has gone beyond Owenacurra.  I understand the frustration of the individual families.  I have met some of them.  Their frustration and fear are very real.  To keep it on money issues relevant to the committee, there seems to be a nest of questions on the decision-making process on capital spending in this area.  It has proved to be almost impossible to get answers to questions on why certain spending decisions were made.  It looks as though it will end up spending a much larger amount going about it the way it has and it will do a huge amount of damage to patients.  I have yet to see a good explanation of why it has happened.  For argument's sake we could probably pick a few other CHOs around the country on which we could do this type of review of decision-making on spending and capital costs.  The CHO in Cork is the one on which I have the most information and where I have the most questions.  We are not speaking anymore about one building in Owenacurra and the distress of one set of families.  We are now speaking about a web of very strange decision-making when it comes to capital spending.
