I welcome Professor Alex Evans, Ms Triona McCormack, Professor Dolores O'Riordan and Professor Mark Keane from UCD and I thank them for attending.  The meeting arises from a discussion we had in Brussels on our trip approximately a month ago and we saw an opportunity for the committee to assist the witnesses in articulating their views on opportunities.  These opportunities relate to science and technology and ensuring sustainability in and support for agriculture; precision agriculture; how these may assist young farmers to attract more people, especially young people, into farming and agriculture as a career path; and initiatives and areas with regard to research and innovation that UCD believes to be important or would like to raise in respect of agriculture and the agrifood sector in general.

Members have a copy of my statement and they are probably familiar with UCD,  but it is worth noting that we are a leading international university, as well as being the largest university in Ireland, with a strong base in agriculture and food science.  That is the perspective from which we come to address the committee<\/p> <p>  I will briefly outline the key challenges facing the agrifood sector and will highlight how UCD and its partners are seeking to address those challenges through research and education.  There is an opportunity for Ireland and for Irish farming, in particular, because this sector is important for the economy.  There is a great opportunity for us to lead in, and beyond, Europe, given key legislation is going through the European Parliament, the report entitled, The Future of Food and Farming: Challenges and Choices for Global Sustainability report, has recently been published and the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.<\/p><p>It is a key point in time and there is an opportunity for Irish agriculture to take a leadership role.  We feel we should be there at that table.<\/p><p> Let me summarise the challenges.  We see a set of independent challenges.  They are all well rehearsed and probably very familiar to this committee.  One is the challenge of the production system and how we increase production.  At the same time, there is a challenge of nutrition.  It is worth mentioning to the committee that one in three globally is malnourished.  In other words, the nutrition content of their diet is not where it should be.  There is also a sustainability challenge.  We are all very familiar with that as we look at the effects of climate change.  Last, and with a particular impact for Ireland in terms of the size and scale of the agrifood sector, there is an economic challenge.  We need to balance all those challenges, their interdependencies and their relatedness.  The production, nutrition, sustainability and economic challenges are critical to address and we need to balance them together.  That is why we believe adopting a whole-systems response is the only way we can respond to the challenges.  This is where policy can help.  There are complementary policies that can drive innovation and investment in the changes needed for the sector.  If we take advantage of this opportunity, the sector will have the opportunity to make the step change and Ireland will really be able to play a leadership role in agriculture internationally.<\/p><p> At UCD we are in the business of creating new knowledge and educating future business people and lawyers, but also farmers and those who work in the agrifood sector.  We really feel this is a very exciting time for the sector.  Never was there a time when the amount of new exciting knowledge being created has been so pervasive.  It is up to us now to take advantage of this and ascertain how we can embed it in our systems and structures nationally.<\/p><p> It is an exciting time to move into the sector.  We are, however, alive to the fact that it does not always feel that way for those involved, particularly those in the farming community.  There are challenges beyond those we could resolve in that context.  I refer to the challenges of access to infrastructure and to the community systems required to make living in an agri-based economy and society viable.  All those are challenges and we recognise that.  What we can do is bring practical examples to the table of innovative and exciting ways of approaching the challenges we face in respect of production, nutrition, and sustainability systems.  In this regard, I will focus on and highlight opportunities in three areas.  The first is an emerging area, the bio-economy.  The second concerns the merging of two sectors in which Ireland has a leading position, the ICT and agrifood sectors, in the context of precision agriculture.  The third is the future of food and nutrition.<\/p><p> I will deal with the bio-economy first.  There is a very exciting opportunity for Ireland in the bio-economy.  We have a rich resource base.  The bio-economy is really about how we make better use of our raw materials and resources and how we optimise and maximise the value of those resources.  We see opportunities in this regard and have developed new technologies for converting those resources into various products, such as bio-based plastics.  This is not all about the production of food as it is also about the production of higher-value food additives and food ingredients.  New technologies are coming on stream that enable that.<\/p><p> Let me give a very practical example of how this is happening on the ground.  We have been very closely involved in and have championed the development of the bio-economy campus, located in Lisheen, County Tipperary.  Many members of this committee are familiar with what is happening in Tipperary in that regard.  The initiative brings together a number of industry partners.  Glanbia is a primary partner but there are others also.  They have been brought together with local government in Tipperary County Council and ourselves in the university with a view to bringing new technologies on-stream.  The institutes of technology are playing a role in examining what future training capacity might be needed on the ground in the bio-economy campus.  The aim is to set up a new bio-refining plant and a new pilot facility for the new technologies.  Essentially, the objective is to consider how what were always considered to be waste products from the dairy sector can be repurposed and how we can create higher-value products from those - bio-based plastics in this instance.  This is a great example of how all the actors can come together to create a very different future.  The community in Lisheen was facing &euro;50 million coming out of the local economy and the loss of jobs in the region.  Now it faces a very different future, with quite a vibrant bio-economy campus that is probably leading in Ireland and which is in one of the European model demonstrator regions.  Lisheen is now expecting &euro;75 million to go into its economy and growth in jobs.  Some 1,800 jobs are predicted by the industry partners involved, either directly or indirectly.  That is a very real, tangible example of how new knowledge, training and education can be brought to bear to mobilise people around opportunities.  What we can look to do now is extend the opportunity back into the production systems while asking what we should be doing with the raw material coming out.  We must determine whether there are further opportunities that we can pursue and how we can get the conversation going within the community.<\/p><p> Another area I highlighted was that of ICT and precision agriculture.  As I stated, these are two sectors in which Ireland excels.  The use of big data is pervasive in every single sector, agriculture being no different.  New satellite technologies and new data analytics tools can be brought to bear on the sector.  An example of where UCD is working very actively on the ground in this regard is its work with Origin Enterprises in the cereal production systems.  In this regard, we are considering increasing the yield from cereal growth - winter barley in this case.  When increasing yield, one of the challenges is achieving a balance with sustainability.  How does one do so without increasing the environmental impact?  In this instance, we are bringing together the data technologies and new soil strategies and putting them into the hands of the growers in a format whereby information is very easy to access.  The objective is to allow the growers to use them to increase their yield at the same time as decreasing the environmental impact of the production system.  It demonstrates that nice balance between the economics, sustainability and production.<\/p><p> With regard to food and nutrition, this is an area in which we really excel.  We have considerable capacity through the Institute of Food and Health.  One of the programmes, Food for Health Ireland, involves many of the institutions coming together with the major actors in the dairy sector seeking to mine the dairy product to determine how we can extract higher-value ingredients from that raw material or resource.  It is a matter of changing and diversifying the product portfolio of the Irish dairy producers from one represented by a high-volume, low-margin commodity to one represented by a higher-value product.  It is also worth noting that having a resource base like UCD, with our international reputation, can do other things for the sector.  I must highlight in particular the recent announcement on beef imports into China from Ireland.  The conversations in this regard started long ago.  The key food safety actors within the Institute for Food and Health have been engaged with the Chinese institutions, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the relevant government departments for many years working their way up to the making of a decision that was an acceptable one for the Chinese to make.  Our role in opening new markets and in using our international relationships to try to further advance the cause of, and case for, Irish agrifood is one that we can focus on.<\/p><p> Let me refer to the future for young farmers, as mentioned at the outset.  There is concern that farming is not an attractive enough career for young people.  We need to work together to really understand how we can make it a compelling career.  If, however, one bears in mind what we have just talked about and the new technologies at play, one concludes that a future farmer will have to be a data analyst and production-systems expert in addition to being a sustainability expert, business owner and entrepreneur.  In this regard, there is a package that is very attractive, notwithstanding the comments made earlier about the infrastructural challenges.  Along with our partners in the institutes of technology and Teagasc, we can start to really tell that story and ascertain whether we can change the perspective on farming as a career.<\/p><p> We are very optimistic about the future.  We believe we are at a point of opportunity.  Considerable change has taken place in the agrifood sector during the past few years.  We believe there is a huge opportunity for us to take a leadership role.  It is where we should be in Europe and we believe that can deliver back into Ireland.  The example of the bio-economy I gave was mobilised by &euro;22 million in funding coming back to us from Europe.  We can see the way in which that engagement can deliver dividends.  We are hopeful but we need to figure out how we can all work together within the system to achieve the kinds of opportunities I outlined and to deliver on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Triona McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCormack for her presentation.  Before I bring in the members, I have a question for her on foot of her reference in her presentation to young farmers.  We had representatives of the European Court of Auditors before our committee two months ago.  We all know the age profile of the farmer in Ireland is quite high, although it has improved a little in recent years.  I understand that 1,000 farmers per day are leaving agriculture within Europe, which is a startling statistic.  If that trend continues over a number of years, the agricultural industry will be in serious difficulty.  We are no exception to that.  As our economy improves, there will probably be more attractive propositions for a young man aged 21, 22 or 23 on leaving college.  How do we address that?  Ms McCormack has teed around that issue.  Is it a perception issue, namely, that farming is not attractive or does it need to be sold in a different way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#J00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527602400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I might ask my colleague, Professor Alex Evans, to respond to that question.  He is the head of our school of agriculture and food science and is dealing with a large population of students on a daily basis who may have an aspiration to have a career in the sector.  He may be able to address exactly what their feelings are about this issue.  It comes back to the point about creating a different story.  This is exciting stuff.  If one is at the cutting edge of data analytics, which is where a great number of our young students would see themselves and want to be with regard to tech start-ups etc.  There is no reason some of that cannot be translated into this environment and so doing could create a different environment.  There are other elements that are limiting factors that we as a university cannot resolve in terms access to infrastructure and schools etc.  However, we can share where we see other disciplines coming into farming and where people may have an aspiration to have an entrepreneurial career.  There is no reason that cannot be achieved in an agrifood context.  We see many opportunities there.  I will hand over to Professor Alex Evans who might also like to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Triona McCormack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527602400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As we all know, the past eight or ten years have been very tough in Ireland but members also will be well aware that the agriculture and food industries have done very well during that time.  I was talking to my colleagues last night and we were celebrating the last short while during which many very good people have entered the agricultural and food industries.  We said this presents a challenge for us to try to keep up the momentum.  While the Chairman pointed out that people are leaving agriculture, possibly by their thousands across Europe, many smart and ambitious young people have entered the agricultural industry in the last while.  Perhaps that is a reflection of other parts of the economy rather than the agrifood sector.  As a result, views on the agriculture and food sector have greatly changed in Ireland.  Twenty years ago people were talking about it as being the sunset industry, where we would buy our food from elsewhere around the world, but now we cannot talk enough about fresh food and low food miles.  If we can continue to build the good story that Ireland has with respect to its agriculture and production systems, that is part of it.  The other part is that it will become a very knowledge-intensive industry.  Education is an absolute requirement.  UCD is only a part of the education system and we have many good people entering agriculture.<\/p> <p>  We often think about people just being farmers, the men and women at the front-end of food production, but a great number of people are involved in post-farm gate agricultural activities.  We should not take our eyes off that.  Employment for Irish people around the world in that area is growing.  There is no simple fix.  One could not say we need a new policy, new opportunity, new food product or a bio-based industry which would do it.  It is the collection of all those parts.  <\/p> <p>  Ensuring we have a viable rural community is a major challenge.  It is not simply about merely having a good price for beef or, for example, ensuring farmers do not have flooding.  It requires all the elements on which the members are focusing, which can be simply summarised as infrastructure.  If it about roads, broadband, schools or the other services with which people are provided, if those are attractive and if there is a living to be made on the land, then I believe agriculture will do well in Ireland.  It will not be easy but I believe we will always be engaged in agriculture.  The past 50 years have showed us that increasingly fewer people are producing food for increasingly more people.  I do not know how that will work if that trend continues or if Ireland can adopt a slightly different approach to trying to feed the world and producing massive volumes of commodity products by starting to produce high-quality products that people want for all sorts of different reasons.  That is a long answer to a complicated question.  It is complex.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alex Evans"},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Evans for his very detailed answer.

I want to make one or two points about young farmers and attracting young people into the industry.  The percentage of the consumers' take home pay that is spent on food has been consistently decreasing.  As a modern society, that is an issue we must address.  The percentage primary producers are getting of what is being charged by the major retailers is also rapidly decreasing.  Our major retailers seem to have only one focus and that is to sell food as cheaply as possible.  Our farmers are producing a top class product under stringent standards.  At some stage those retailers will break the camel's back.  They cannot continue in that direction.  I am not criticising the work the witnesses are doing and it is not their remit to sort out the major retailers but there is a slide in that direction.  We need only compare milk prices in the 1980s with those of today, as well as the percentage primary producers are getting and their margins.  Dairy farmers have probably trebled or quadrupled the size of their operations but that has not done much for the bottom line.  If we are to attract people into the industry, those factors must be addressed.<\/p><p>The research being done in UCD has a huge part to play in the future.  I have been lucky enough to have had contact with Professor Kevin O'Connor on the Lisheen project and have seen his knowledge and depth of research there.  Great credit is due to him and others for getting it going.  They picked a grand site for it within five or six miles of my home base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#J00700","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very happy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#K00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>They could not have picked a better site for it.  We will not complain about that.  It has massive potential.  I hope the bio-refinery gets going as quickly as possible.  However, there is a small mistrust of the companies involved.  We have a product now that was waste, which was a cost for the industry.  Now, instead of being a cost, it is going to be a benefit for the industry.<\/p> <p>  I was on the Irish Dairy Board, or Ornua as it is called now, for eight years and we knew the exact value of each product produced from the litre of milk.  We knew what a pound of butter, a tonne of skim milk powder and a tonne of whole milk powder were worth all down the line.  However, we do not know what this will add to the chain.  I am not criticising the research.  The witnesses give a global figure for the added value but how much is permutated whey worth to a company such as Glanbia and what worth will it put back into the bottom line for the primary producer?  The potential is immense.  I recall that 25 years ago one either fed whey to pigs or just got rid of it, but now it can add immensely to the bottom line.<\/p> <p>  The witness said that one in three of the world's population are malnourished.  One of the major challenges for research is climate change.  We all have to face the fact that climate change is happening and ensure that the restrictions it will impose on us will not hinder our production in the future.  Consider the current situation with derogation and the impact on water quality of run-off and so forth.  Half of our dairy farmers are farming under derogation.  If we lost that derogation for any reason, be it water quality or whatever, our production would be greatly restricted.  The research the witnesses are doing on ensuring that the nutrients we spread can be used by the soil, that we do not have run-off and that we can produce in a sustainable and green manner is hugely important.  They are doing immense research on that.  The low emission slurry spreading period has been extended by a month.  I have practised that on my farm.  If farmers get into the habit of practising it they will never go back to the other way because the value from the nutrients will more than repay the cost of spreading it.  One can see with one's own eyes, without having the research, the value one gets out of the nutrients and the lack of hindering of grass growth.<\/p> <p>  We are the most sustainable dairy producers in the world and we are fifth with regard to beef.  However, we cannot stand still and this research must continue.  It is going to become a smart game so the research the witnesses do is invaluable to us.  On the nutrients side, I have seen the research plant at Moorepark where new products are being designed to provide more nutrients and more added value to product.  Given the scope and the wider range that has given our industry, there cannot be enough investment put into that side.  That is what will keep our industry to the forefront.  However, we need to get back to plain economics and the price and return for the primary producer.  Unfortunately, with all the standards being imposed with regard to quality assurance and so forth, the primary producer is getting squeezed further.  It is worst for the beef and tillage sectors.  They are being squeezed out of existence.  There was a headline about what dairy incomes were in 2017 - it will be a different story in 2018 given the spring we had - but the other sectors are under even more pressure.  We cannot expect a constant stream of top quality product if there is not going to be a return for it.<\/p> <p>  I commend the research the witnesses are doing.  It is invaluable and has put us at the forefront of world production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#K00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  In her opening statement Ms McCormack said it is an exciting time to be in the food and farming sector, although she was fully aware that it does not feel that way, and that we all need to work together to make farming a compelling choice.  Will she expand further on that disconnect, where she sees the potential and considers it exciting yet she is very much aware that it does not feel that way for many practitioners?<\/p> <p>  This touches on the overall issue of how the production and agrifood sector, as opposed to the primary producer, has gone from strength to strength in recent years.  It has been one of the big success stories of our economy.  Exports have increased from approximately &euro;7 billion six years ago to &euro;12 billion today.  It is a massive increase and it is continuing to go in that direction.  However, the primary producers who are doing the farming have not felt that.  They continue to feel more pressure and to become more squeezed.  How do we get the benefits of innovation and technology to them and make that work at farm level?  It is certainly working and making an impact at the enterprise, business and production levels, but the issue is how to make that work at farm level across the various sectors.<\/p> <p>  Dairying has been powering ahead in recent years and much has been happening.  Although it is a difficult sector in terms of inputs, time and so forth for those involved, there is a profit margin in it even if it can be volatile.  How can we make units in the beef, sheep and tillage sectors viable?  By and large there tend to be smaller units in those sectors.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' perspective on farm size and how that feeds into the use of technology and more innovative practices.<\/p> <p>  With regard to climate change and our climate change goals, I realise the witnesses' speciality is research but we are now part of an international agreement where our production methods are not necessarily recognised as being as efficient as those in other member states.  What are the witnesses' views, as researchers and innovators, on the practicality of the climate change targets in respect of leading to more effective and efficient agriculture in terms of carbon leakage and not being able to ensure we can make the most from new practices?  Also, what are their views on anaerobic digestion and the potential for using it?  It is far more developed in Northern Ireland.  Do they see a bigger role for that?

We have to work that way.  We have to create examples on the ground of how this works, how the new technology has impact and how simple it is to engage with.<\/p><p>That is a challenge.  It is a challenge for researchers and industry that brings this to market.  It must be accessible to people and usable on the ground in a farm situation.  If that is the case, we will start to see adoption because nothing drives adoption as well as an economic imperative from a business person.  Farmers have their own balance sheet every year and they will be looking at how to improve their situation.  If they feel there are mechanisms that can improve their situation, I feel we will get a response.  It is up to those partners, about whom I spoke earlier, working together to get those responses out on the ground in that translational mode.  I will ask Professor Keane to comment, particularly in respect of the dairy questions about which a few questions were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Triona McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527602400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I am a professor of computer science in UCD.

Ms McCormack mentioned the notion of a systemic view.  I will not criticise people because they have their own businesses and are looking at the bottom line and what they get for what they sell, but we must think of the farmer as sitting within a much wider environment and system.  Part of that system is the sustainability aspect so we are going to start paying money as fines for polluting the environment.  Can we not have a governmental scheme that will feed back some of that as an income to farmers to get them to change behaviour, which would then reduce the amount of pollution going into the environment?  That is one example of another system that we must take into account as well as the core production of food system.<\/p> <p>  The information technology system will become very important.  Precision agriculture is based completely on the notion of data.  At present, we have one model for data, namely, that Google and Facebook own it all, but we are seeing that this model is disappearing and that people will own their own data.  If a company like a processor depends upon a whole community of farmers to produce a given product and depends on the data those farmers have, this will also become another source of income for those farmers.  We must realise that we are on the point of a step change in how we do agriculture.  If we get this right and think about it in a systematic way, we will see that there are other sources of income that are available and that this should improve the lot of farmers in the environment, but we need to think that way and it must be done in a regulatory way as well.  Government must think about it because nobody else is going to do it.  The processors are not going to do it because they will have their own agenda.  We need someone in a God-like situation overseeing the system and organising that properly so that we move on to this new stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Would Professor Evans like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#L00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527602400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I might add a word on the training.

The very first exercise that is done is to estimate the return on investment.  This is a big sea change in the research environment that I have seen over the past 15 years.

We are looking nationally at new models of energy management and, in that context, looking at CO2.  One of the interesting debates and a real field of research for us in the next period will be the difference between methane emissions and CO2 emissions in terms of making an impact on climate change.  I preface my remarks by saying that it is not my technical area but methane has a shorter half-life than CO2.  It disappears in the environment more quickly, yet we do not have an adjustment for that.<\/p><p> In the context of national emission levels, we must consider what can be done in other sectors to balance our system so that we can continue with the kind of agrifood production that is valuable to our society and economy but that will involve bringing in other disciplines.

We need to look at our whole system, including energy, manufacturing and production to see if we can balance one against the other.

In the statement submitted to the committee, reference is made to climate change as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Climate change impacts are real and are felt.  In Ireland, we risk exceeding our emissions targets and being fined for doing so.  Whatever we do from this moment on must address climate impacts.<\/blockquote> <p>Climate change is up there in terms of its importance but there are no solutions in the statement.  I have asked questions of many witnesses who have come before this committee and do not expect anyone to provide a silver bullet, including the witnesses here today.  However, there has been a 22% increase in dairy production in recent years for obvious reasons.  The figures on average farm incomes recently released by Teagasc show that almost all of the income increases can be attributed to increases in profitability in the dairy sector but that is transient, as the witnesses know.  Nonetheless, more and more people in the farming community are understandably, for profitability reasons, moving in that direction but dairy production has the greatest impact in the context of climate change because of methane emissions.  We face a &euro;455 million fine.  The EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, has warned that we are facing huge fines down the line but I do not see any solutions.<\/p><p>I applaud the witnesses for the positivity of their contribution and appreciate that they are working in an area that is critically important.  Innovation is critically important in all sectors of our society.  All of the headings under which the witnesses spoke today are both important and praiseworthy.  However, we face a number of issues that we must tackle.  The farming model we have in this country is having a severe impact on our climate change targets and we need to talk about that.  We need to figure out how to reduce the level of methane emissions.  Is there some scientific way of getting our methane emissions down?  This is essential in the context of the move towards increased dairy production, which, as Deputy Cahill pointed out, is a result of the cheap food policy of the EU.  That policy is all about reducing the cost of food to the consumer, which, in turn, reduces the amount of money in the pockets of primary producers.<\/p><p>We have spoken a lot about dairy and tillage today but in Donegal, for example, the vast majority of farmers are involved in sheep and beef production up on the hills and on bad land.  In that context, the statistics from the Council for the West were absolutely alarming but nobody wants to talk about them.  We have seen a 42% reduction in the number of family farms in the west of Ireland in the last 20 years.  Almost half of all family farms in the west of Ireland are gone because we are moving towards the intensification of farming.<\/p><p>I defer to Deputy Cahill's expertise as a practising farmer with decades of experience.  He has argued that farmers now have to quadruple their farming in order to have the same amount of money in their pockets, which is shocking.  We need experts like those here today to talk about that.  We need to talk about the fact that the farming model we have in Ireland is driving up our greenhouse gas emissions.  I could scream about this at times.  We have the European Commission telling us that it will fine us hundreds of millions of euro because of our farming model but at the same time, the economic model presided over by the same Commission forces people in that direction.  There is absolute hypocrisy at the heart of the EU's agriculture policy.  The EU lectures us, arguably correctly, on our climate change targets while forcing farmers down a particular road because of its cheap food policy.<\/p><p>Are there academic solutions?  The presentation from the witnesses was excellent.  Reference was made to a multisectoral and cross-departmental approach within UCD.  Are there solutions being developed at UCD to the challenges that are screaming at us in terms of agriculture and the model that we have on this island, going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#M00300","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The witnesses are all very welcome.  I thank them for their presentation.  In the context of young people and attracting more of them into the agriculture sector, conversations like this help a lot.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues stand out.  First, there is what we already do in the mainstream.  Most farming here is dairy, bovine or sheep production.  That is the mainstay of Irish agriculture; it is what farmers here are used to, good at and set up for.  They are set up in terms of the machinery they need and it works for them.  Diversification away from that would be difficult for most, particularly as farmers in general are risk averse.  They do not want to do something they do not know in case it does not work and that is understandable.  They are prepared to take a few bad years, a few good years, put the two together and accept that they are doing okay overall.  However, as others have said, the continued intensification in recent years is leading to a situation whereby farmers are expected to get more from less.  The acre of ground is expected to produce more.  This means that more inputs are going into the land in order to get more out of it.  In terms of the animals themselves, more inputs are also going into them to get them fatter faster and to move them along quicker in order to make more money.  That is putting a strain on the system.  Slurry, for example, is a huge problem in this context.  In the west of Ireland, marginal land tends to be wet anyway.  Grants were given to farmers to store slurry but now the land is not good enough to allow that slurry to be spread and the tanks are full.  We run into this problem every spring and it will only get worse if we are going to have longer winters in future, which seems to be the pattern.  More work needs to be done on this issue.<\/p> <p>  The cheap food policy was referred to previously.  One solution might be to build a wall around Europe and make everyone pay a little more for their food.  We could try to force it or control it but it is a market system which cannot be forced or controlled.  Indeed, there are many reasons not to do that.  However, if one looks at the plight of the primary producer, one finds many reasons to do it.  This is a difficult issue but I know it is not an area of research for the witnesses here today.<\/p> <p>  While we have traditional farming in sectors known well to Irish farmers, other areas are emerging which are new and different.  These are niche areas that could possibly be explored, developed and made more mainstream.  These are the areas in which I am interested, as are those farming in the west of Ireland and on land that is not good enough for dairy production or more intensive farming.  I am very interested in finding solutions for that part of the world.  One area of particular interest is that relating to biorefinery.  One sees so much on Facebook and on the Internet in general regarding the problem of plastics in our oceans and the overproduction of plastic packaging.  Plastic is a derivative of oil and packaging is a huge problem.  We can try to get people to use less packaging but we will not wipe it out all together.  An alternative will have to be found for all of this plastic packaging.  If there is to be an alternative, does that represent an opportunity for farmers?  Alternatives will not necessarily only come from by-products of the dairy industry.<\/p><p>We often hear about hemp and some of its derivatives being used to produce plastic or packaging products.  Are there opportunities in that area?  Has research been done in that regard?<\/p><p> Someone was before the committee previously and spoke about the horticultural sector.  I was looking at the bottom of the fridge the other day.  There were four small beetroots in a small package.  They come cooked and ready to eat.  They came all the way from Portugal.  I cannot understand why we cannot produce them in Ireland.  Maybe we cannot and there is some reason for it.  Some years ago the volcano went up in Iceland and we had a plume of smoke.  People said that if we could not import vegetables into Ireland then we would run out of them after one week.  It seems that our supply is in a precarious state.  Are there opportunities in the horticultural sector that we could consider?  Could we look at technology to move forward with?<\/p><p> Aside from food or food products, are there other things that farmers can produce, sell and make a profit on?  There may be technology that can improve things in this area.  Genetic modification is something with which food consumers have a problem.  That has been clearly stated so we need to be careful in respect of it.  However, that does not mean we should not be looking at technology.<\/p><p> Interesting points were made from both sides of the table.  Generally, our problem is that we are producing cheap food for the masses.  Professor Evans referred to the opportunity to produce a higher quality product for the top shelf and get a better price for it.  That brings me back to the point about how we market Irish food.  I have Kerrygold butter in mind.  The brand has sold exceptionally well throughout the world.  Can we do more of that with other Irish products?  We need to ensure that it is not only about the food we produce but also about the inputs we use.  We need to be able to stand over the process.  If we cannot stand over what we produce, we will run into problems later on.<\/p><p> I am interested in the whole idea of developing what are currently niche markets into something mainstream.  What research is going on in this area?  Where can that bring us?  Can it bring us there quickly?  In truth, while I absolutely agree there is great opportunity &ndash; the deputation discussed this earlier &ndash; that opportunity will only come with change.  We need to realise that change quickly because Irish farming is in a crisis.  While dairy is going well, large sectors of Irish farming are in crisis.  If the family farm is not making money, we will see more of the industrial farm.  There may be industrial farms owned by families but they still use the industrial farm model.  Consumers worldwide and especially consumers near to us do not want that and they have said as much.  Food miles are important in Europe.  We need to respond by working with what they want.<\/p><p> I am delighted that the witnesses are before the committee and I am glad the work they are doing is going in the direction that I believe we should be going.  More work should be done to meet the requirements of the consumer.  The main requirement is to ensure that the primary producer gets a proper return.  This has been said by everyone at the meeting.  That is the big thing missing in all of this.  To a large extent, that is not the responsibility of UCD but we have our part to play in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#M00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the UCD research team.  I thank its members for the interesting presentation.  It is clear that they are involved in cutting-edge work.  I commend them and their stakeholders on their work.<\/p> <p>  It is a great source of pride to most Irish people that we are world leaders when it comes to food and innovation.  As others have mentioned, instead of letting it become a twilight industry we have embraced it.  We have the necessary roots in it.  I am mindful of all the work being done with Irish companies by our guests.  It is indigenous work of which we can be proud on the world stage.  I know those involved in UCD have to keep working with science and technology and I know that is what they are about.<\/p> <p>  There has been talk of the dairy industry.  The deputation mentioned tillage and soil in the context of getting increasing productivity.  To what extent does UCD work with primary producers?  In particular, to what extent does UCD work with suckler cow farmers or sheep farmers?  It is implicit in talk about the future for young farmers that there seems to be a more upbeat approach in dairy, especially with regard to younger people and the possibilities.  Many farmers have small marginal holdings in the west of Ireland.  It is not that people are not doing their best.  It is not that there is no pride in what people are doing or in their communities.  However, it is more challenging.  The last winter was extended.  Thankfully, it has well evaporated now but it tested many people.  I imagine that it made younger people wonder why they would do it.<\/p> <p>  I will explain why I am asking about the extent to which UCD works with primary producers.  Our guests referred to systems and improving production.  In the case of diary, UCD is looking at the existing system.  The idea is to take what the primary producer produces and then develop by-products to displace plastics made from fossil fuels and so on.  To what extent is UCD dependent on the existing system and the fact that the primary producer does not get paid much in the food supply chain?<\/p> <p>  Is it not the case that the price supports we pursue and that operate under CAP are an integral part of the equation?  Is it not the case that UCD is really building on that?  If we did not have CAP or price supports and so on, then would the UCD model be completely different?  Other than in the abstract, how does UCD address the issues around the price the primary producer is receiving?  I know there have been high-level reports and investigations at EU level.  However, the reality is that unless we address this, problems will arise.  Younger people have more options and they are more educated.  They may go into the food industry but perhaps not as primary producers.<\/p> <p>  Did UCD make submissions on the new CAP to the Commission?  Is that part of the role of UCD?  Does UCD feed in at that level?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to dairy by-products or bio-based alternatives to adhesives and plastics.  How does that work with carbon credits?  Has that not been considered yet?  Of course, farmers and food production keep getting hammered for carbon emissions and carbon efficiency.  Is that something that can be credited to farming?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to how 30% of the world population is malnourished.  Is that the correct figure?  I realise that our guests did not go into detail on it.  In any event, I understand that more people are probably going to die from obesity than from starvation.  There is irony in the fact that in developed countries such as ours, where there is so much emphasis on food and nutrition as well as a great deal of investment in food, people are becoming more obese.  While people may be eating more calories and food is more calorific, it is not necessarily nutritious.  That is a serious problem for health and well-being.  I believe it spills over into mental health as well.  Do our guests have any observations on this contradiction?  When I go to the supermarket, I can buy processed food far cheaper than anything else.  I know we are talking about how to get money to the primary producer but food such as that to which I refer is generally cheaper.  More nutritious food seems to be more expensive.  We have heard in evidence at other sessions of the growing market for organic food and that people are prepared to pay more.  However, it seems only people of a particular socioeconomic background are taking that on.  There seems to be many people left behind.  What we eat and what we put into our bodies is part of living.  Notwithstanding the work of UCD, it seems that we are being pulled back.  A sugar tax was imposed in respect of pop drinks and so on in an attempt to combat the problem but it is clearly an issue.  I am aware that sugar is addictive.<\/p><p>We find ourselves in an interesting state of affairs where we cannot stop eating once we start or are eating the wrong food and so on.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#N00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I will be brief, as most of the statements have been made.  Given the labour issue, where do the witnesses see the agriculture industry progressing in future?  Will that be the new quota and the new barrier to development?  During the boom, young people left agricultural colleges and some colleges closed.  We have seen that happening again now to some degree, especially this year.  Do the witnesses fear that the agricultural sector's real limitation is going to be young trained farmers - or labour of another nature - coming into the system?  We have seen a ferocious growth in the dairy industry in the last two or three years since the quotas have gone.  Would the witnesses agree that has benefitted the industry enormously but it is questionable how much the farmer on the group has benefitted?<\/p> <p>  The scaling up of farms - by up to 100% - has had a major social impact on what was a way of life.  Would the witnesses agree that it is not just a way of life now, it is becoming a business and with that comes exceptional physical and mental pressures on farmers?  How sustainable will the next generation be with those pressures?  The real issue is generational change and getting young farmers into the industry.  We have had a policy that has increased production and in many ways has left the farmer a slave to that production level with very little income.  It was previously stated that the economic factors will ensure farmers will stay.  If those economic factors are not good enough, will the farmers stay or in a decade will we have a huge issue because a young trained farmer network will not be coming through?

I thank the Senators and the Deputy for the comments on what we are doing.  It is critical that Ireland continues to invest in research and innovation.  It is necessary.  We are hearing from the committee today how necessary it is that new knowledge comes to the fore and that solutions are found and translated into farms.  That is the way forward for a vibrant agrifood sector.  I thank the committee for its kind remarks on the quality of our work but also the shared recognition that this is a critical area for continued national investment in research and innovation.  It is more critical in this sector than in many others as we seek to find the solutions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn asked if there are solutions where we can find the perfect pitch point between sustainability and intensification.  The question was posed specifically on methane emissions but I think the example we gave earlier from the tillage sector applies, where we are bringing technologies and new disease and soil management strategies together - that is a new way of working.  Working with industry and the producers is also new.  We are finding solutions.  They are there but they are not obvious.  They require us to do things differently, bring different actors together and work with everybody.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Mulherin had the same question on whether we are engaging with producers.  We will be doing more of that as we seek to change the way we do research and innovation to produce these solutions to complex issues.  Working in this different way is a relatively new area for all of us.  There are examples and they are coming to the fore.

They are allowing us to see value in products where value was not seen before.  They also allow us to reach back and ask what kind of products could we start to grow that might have greater value.  Professor Kevin O'Connor - our leader in the national bio-economy research centre and who was mentioned earlier by Deputy Cahill - is considering things like sugar beet and forestry, and asking what opportunity is there for traditional land products like that.  We will start to find those opportunities but we need to continue to reach back into the product base, see what we are growing and ask how we can optimise that.

We do not have any easy solutions either.  There is a major challenge around how much carbon it takes to produce a kilogram of beef or a litre of milk.  That is a critical question.  If more milk is produced, is, proportionally, more carbon and water used?  We need to get to a situation where we have a description of the total envelope of megatonnes of carbon we are allowed each year.  The question then is how much milk or meat can we produce from that.  Increasing efficiency there allows greater production at the same level of pollution, to use that kind of emotive wording.  Our milk production going up 22% does not necessarily mean our impact on the environment has gone down 22%.  The benefits are coming from more milk per animal.  We do have more animals but we do not have the same increase in the number of animals as we have in milk production.<\/p> <p>  We are also getting better utilisation out of our pastures.  I am sure the members of the committee are aware of trying to get tonnes of dry matter per hectare out of the ground and Teagasc's target is to try to get farmers to utilise ten tonnes of grass per hectare.  That is very challenging in some parts of the world whereas other people do not find that difficult to achieve.  There is a huge education piece there.  Our farming structure gives us the potential to do more and the loss of the quotas was symptomatic of that.<\/p> <p>  We have not started to address the challenge of increasing the carbon fixing abilities of our soils.  Understanding the carbon fixing potential of our soil is the first thing that we need to do.  Increasing soil capture by 0.4% per year was talked about in the Paris climate discussions in 2015.  If we could do that, we would eliminate our climate change challenges.  In other words, if people got down to looking at how to increase the carbon capturing ability of the soils they own, they could make a huge difference.  That is a challenge facing all of us and I hope we can work on it.  <\/p> <p>  It probably means that it will not be business as usual.  Different approaches to how we do agriculture are needed, such as deeper rooting plants and differing tilling methods.  People will embrace those approaches more as the challenges become more acute.  We may need to grow different kinds of forages on our land to feed to our animals.  The tillage sector is definitely having a hard time now but it is acknowledged that we do not grow enough protein crops in Ireland.  Maybe we are just growing the wrong plants.  That is easy to say when we are sitting in a nice air conditioned room but agriculture is very different around the world.  The plants we grow now are very different from what we grew 100 years ago, so what will we be growing 20 years from now?  What incentives and market forces will encourage people to change?  I think there are outputs there.  <\/p> <p>  Horticulture was mentioned.  It is a fantastically successful story in Ireland.  It has undergone a transformation in the last decade.  I refer to protected crops.  There are hectares and hectares of glasshouses in parts of Ireland, in north County Dublin in particular, where fruits and vegetables are now grown on a scale that was heretofore unimaginable.<\/p><p>It is done in a controlled environment, from managing the nutrients going into the plants to managing the diseases of the plants.  It is a high-tech industry.  Maybe we do not grow all the green vegetables that the Irish people would eat but we certainly are growing an increasing quantity of them.<\/p><p> I would make a another point here.  We do make submissions on the CAP, to the Department and to Brussels as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alex Evans","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527602400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the questions Deputy Martin Kenny posed.  One example of what we have done with plant growers to give them added value would be the growers of Irish herbs.  Traditional Irish herbs, if they are leafy, have quite a short shelf life.  We extracted compounds from them and put them into drinks that, for example, were of benefit to joint health.  We have taken it from going to their site, growing them to make sure that they were grown in the proper conditions to maximise the benefits that we would get from the herb, and showing them how to extract it, how to make the drink and right through to a human trial to say the benefit this drink it will have to one's joint health.  In another example, we worked with a mushroom company developing the technology to enhance the vitamin D level.  It is an issue, in particular, for Irish people.  Across northern Europe, we find it difficult to get enough vitamin D.  There are many health benefits, if we could increase the amount of vitamin D.  With the technology, we increase the amount of vitamin D, and work right through to human trial to show that those who consumed the mushrooms produced under these certain conditions had higher vitamin D levels.  That allowed them to sell at a higher price into the retailers.  Retailers in that case were willing to pay a premium for these products.  We also have examples of work extracting glucans from seaweed that is found all along the west coast and using it as an animal feed to show that the animals had enhanced immunity and required fewer antibiotics.  Indeed, we are now transferring that into the human chain as well to enhance the immune system.  Those are merely some examples of what we do.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny's questions around branding are relevant.  It is fantastic what is being done with Kerrygold.  At present, we are four years into a project to see whether there are specific benefits in Irish cheese because the milk is coming from a grass-fed regime that is not available in many places around the world.  We are working with companies to see can we get a unique selling point for Irish cheese.  It would be taking it from working at producer level right through to looking at the nutrient content and the health benefits.  It feeds in to the public health element about which Senator Mulherin spoke.  We had quite a lot of publicity last year showing that while many people perceive full-fat cheese as having a negative effect on benefits, we were able to show the opposite.  In fact, it was decreasing cholesterol and not affecting weight gain even when people were consuming what would be considered quite high amounts of cheese.<\/p> <p>  There is another niche area that our work would tie into.  There has been much mention of sheep in the west of Ireland and a couple of our colleagues within agriculture and food look at differentiating, particularly Irish meat.  For example, they were able to take lamb that was reared in Connemara and compare it with lamb from other parts of Ireland, and, indeed, other parts of the world, and show that it is quite different and that one can differentiate it from other products, and then to see whether there are taste benefits coming from that lamb compared with any other.  Consequently, one would be able to brand it as, for example, a Connemara lamb with a special taste and perhaps a special nutrient profile.  That type of work, based on provenance, traceability and authenticity, is a big element of what we do.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on the malnutrition piece, I suppose over-nutrition is possibly a bigger problem than under-nutrition.  Our work programme takes on two sides of that.  One is looking at it very much at a molecular level because some people become obese and stay relatively healthy whereas other people quite quickly develop inflammatory conditions, such as  type 2 diabetes.  We have work trying to understand why one person is more predisposed towards obesity and the other risk factors associated with it.<\/p> <p>  We also work from a public health campaign perspective.  As a university, we play an important role within Healthy Ireland and are involved in the initiatives.  It is a big challenge in trying to change consumer behaviour.  We have moved to foods that we like for that very reason - because we like them.  We tend to like foods that are high in salt, high in sugar and high in fat.  Consumer behaviour, particularly from our school of public health, is an area of key concern to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018052900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Dolores O'Riordan"},{"type":"speech","time":1527602400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Whereas many people torment themselves with low-fat cheese, it is good to hear that full-fat cheese comes out on top.

We need to take advantage of the new knowledge that is out there and get it quickly out.  It was remarked on earlier that the conversation here today is welcome because it is an airing of that potential new future.  We quickly need to change that narrative or story around what is possible in agriculture and then in the agrifood sector in Ireland.  There is an opportunity.  It is back to the point that Professor Evans was making earlier about that continuum.  We all need to work together.  It needs to be a shared Irish story about how we can sustain the agricultural production sector and make that as attractive as possible, while flowing this new knowledge back, as well as how we can get that out into the agricultural colleges and more embedded in things such as the green certificate, which is recognised already as providing value and much engagement.  It is a matter of using our mechanisms well and feeding more of these technology solutions but making them accessible and showing the value and being able to show the differentiation.  Critically, there is an opportunity but unless we make change now the opportunity could pass and we could be looking at a sector on the producer side that is in decline.

If anything, Ireland has shown that it can adapt to these technologies and that it is adaptable, once it becomes clear what we have to do.

The current generation will not move on from it does at the moment, which is typical.  There will be consolidation in the sector as well, and many small farms will disappear.

The mindset in Brussels and at the European Commission is that we should maximise everything that can be extracted from what is produced in the first instance, before it is converted into energy products.

Although Ireland does well producing dairy and meat products from a sustainability point of view, they, nonetheless, have a much greater negative impact on the environment than, for example, protein from non-animal sources.  Animal proteins are important from a nutritional point of view; one is not going to get the same nutritional profile from plant proteins.

Conservation agriculture involves having fewer inputs and considering what the outputs might be as a result.  The profit might be greater.  There has been huge progress on this in the tillage sector, with practices such as not leaving soil bare, not ploughing it too deeply too many times, the use of cover crops, avoiding till sowing and so on.  That all makes perfect sense and people can get their heads around that.<br\/><br\/>How do we apply conservation agriculture in Ireland in a grass-based system where we do not plough up all our farms?  My colleagues in UCD have done some fascinating work on multi-species swards over the past number of years<b>.<\/b>This means not growing one variety of grass anymore, but rather growing up to 20 different varieties of plants for the animals to eat.  They have research that shows the benefits of that, but I like to think the amount of plant above the ground is the same as the amount of plant below the ground.  If there are multiple species, there are roots going to different depths and occupying different niches, which can thrive or survive drought or flood and can fix carbon at different levels.  It is most interesting that the animals seem to do better on this kind of pasture, particularly when we look at their parasite loads.  There are natural systems for controlling intestinal parasites.  This is part of what our crop production colleagues call &quot;integrated pest management&quot;, where one pest can be used against another, or one natural system against another system.  That means, for example, less use of chemicals in an apple orchard.  A little more fungus might be tolerated somewhere along the way, but there might also be a few more ladybirds, beetles and so on.  This creates a different type of product which might be more marketable in the end. <br\/><br\/>If all that is wrapped up together, we are talking about the ecology of agriculture and biodiverse systems.  People are getting back to thinking about agriculture as a system now, rather than just a process of feeding grass to cows and getting milk.  It is much more complicated than that, and more researchers are now looking at agriculture as a system.  In Ireland, we can do that very well.  We have a good grasp of many elements, and many people around the world look to how we manage our system.

I thank them for putting me on first as I have a domestic matter to attend, my daughter is receiving some awards from Rathmines College in the next couple of hours.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee to deal with queries it may have about my background and the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, itself.  I spent almost 40 years working mainly in education, in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe<b>.  <\/b>I have occupied public roles, in that I was president of IT Sligo, but I have also worked in, governed, reviewed or investigated secondary, further and higher education institutions within the State and voluntary sectors and I have worked within for-profit and not-for-profit educational institutions.  In my personal life, I have led and governed charitable and sports bodies.  I am a science graduate of Trinity College Dublin and a management graduate of the Institute of Public Administration.<br\/><br\/>The National College of Art and Design is one of the oldest education institutions in the State.  It traces its origin back as far as 1746.  Its present structure and designation date back to 1971 when it was established as the National College of Art and Design by an Act of the Oireachtas.  That Act very clearly lays the responsibility for management and oversight on An Bord, which is appointed by the Minister.  The NCAD is located in Thomas Street in the heart of the historic Liberties in Dublin, as most members will know.<br\/><br\/>The college is a systemically critical component of the creative arts provision in Dublin and nationally.  While much of the headline activity in higher education in recent years in Ireland has been around science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, it is increasingly realised that STEAM, the creative nexus between arts, on the one hand, and science and engineering, on the other, is even more important if global challenges - ageing, energy and climate change, to name but a few - are to be addressed.  The NCAD has a vital role to play in helping to address those challenges.  Creative arts education provides students with the ability to look at these problems afresh and to contribute unique insights to their solution.  The Creative Ireland initiative has refocused attention on the value of the arts in Irish life to personal and community development and to our global reputation, and the NCAD will play its part in realising the benefits of this focus on the creative arts.<br\/><br\/>The challenges faced generally in the higher education sector over the past ten years were specifically manifest in the NCAD.  In this college, difficulties in balancing budgets were compounded by technical problems in preparing financial statements.  I acknowledge the very important work done by the previous board under the leadership of Professor Niamh Brennan.  The board, with the support of the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority and the staff and students of the college, managed to get many of these problems under control.  I believe that this year will see the preparation and finalisation of accounts brought back in line with what is required of public sector bodies.<br\/><br\/>While the preparation of financial statements is under control, much work remains to underpin the important work done by the previous board.  As chairperson designate, I will be bringing to the next board meeting in June four objectives to be achieved within the board's three-year term of office.  Given that these should be approved by the board, I offer them to the committee at this stage as my own views on appropriate objectives.<br\/><br\/>First, the college is running a deficit, and it should be the intention of the board, in conjunction with the director, Professor Glennie, and her staff, to ensure that there is a balanced budget, working towards an annual surplus of 6%, by 2021.  Second, the weaknesses in the underpinning financial and HR management systems need to be addressed and an organisational development plan needs to be put in place and implemented.  Third, it must be ensured that the NCAD continues to be compliant with the code of practice for State bodies and operates to the highest levels of corporate and academic governance.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, the college should be operating a strategic plan that outlines a clear strategic direction for it.  This will take into account the future position of the NCAD within the higher education landscape and will have identified the strategic partnerships that best support the agreed direction.  It will have addressed the educational and philosophical tension that exists between holding on to all that is good about its current curriculum, with its emphasis on making and doing, and embracing what is new and valuable and losing that which could be lost without loss.<br\/><br\/>Once again, I thank members for the opportunity to appear before them as chairperson designate.  Our board has met twice to date, the most recent meeting being this afternoon.  I am excited about the prospect of working over the next three years with such a talented group of individuals, each of whom brings a unique perspective to the work of the board.  I would welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee in the future to brief it on progress at the NCAD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Thorn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thorn.

What will be his priorities in the short term to overcome these?  I acknowledge there are many challenges, as outlined in Dr. Thorn's statement.  The fourth objective in his opening statement seemed to refer to entering into interinstitutional relationships in the higher education sector.

I believe the opportunities I have been given in the past couple of years, in particular, including the UL investigation I undertook last year and the recently completed statutory investigation into Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, have been like a finishing school for identifying what is good and not so good in governance.  If I do not know where the bodies are buried, I know how to find them.  If I do not know how to find them, I know when to ask.

From an operational perspective, the board must oversee the implementation of robust management processes within the organisation.  That is on the functional side, if I can call it that.<\/p> <p>  On the educational side, the college has a very great reputation for producing graduates who can both think and do.  That means they do an awful lot of hands-on activity but there is general recognition that they need to move in this regard and start to include digital technologies and embrace the digital world.  That educational tension needs to be thought through.<\/p> <p>  The third question was on the interinstitutional relationships of the NCAD.  There was a creative arts review in 2013.  It covered creative arts provision in the Dublin area and it laid great emphasis on collaboration and co-operation between providers.  It is safe to say that the ambition in this regard has not yet been realised and that there are still institutions operating quasi-independently.  As I understand it, there is a review before the board of the HEA that will potentially re-articulate some ideas about mergers within the Dublin area.  This has come up before.  For example, the NCAD and the Institute of Art, Design and Technology have been referred to.  Over a quite short period, the board will have to come to a position on what will be in the best interests of the NCAD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Thorn"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>What is the timeframe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#D00800","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527604200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>To be honest, I do not know.

The headline figures are a 25% increase in students and an almost 50% decrease in the core grant.  That puts any sector under pressure.  The first of the main factors that have to be dealt with over the next couple of years within higher education is deciding from a political perspective what funding model will be used.  We have had the Cassells report but I am agnostic about which part of it should be implemented.  Something needs to happen, however, if higher education is to continue to grow and develop, particularly considering the anticipated numbers coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Thorn"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#E00200","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Are there any other questions or comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#E00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thorn for his presentation.

Each one has different outcomes and very different consequences.

The institutes of technology, for example, have suggested that the first three years up to level 7 should be funded by the State and thereafter, at level 8 and above, funding it should become the private responsibility.  I believe that this bears thinking about.

I speak as a care leaver, that is, someone with direct experience of growing up in foster and residential care.  I am the founder of the Care Leavers Network Ireland, representing approximately 15,000 care leavers in Ireland.  With the support of ERASMUS+ funding, we are also developing a European network of care leavers network in England, Italy, Croatia and Romania.<br\/><br\/>Our paper highlighted the many difficulties faced by children in care within the educational system.  We propose some measures to improve their outcomes.  Children and young people in care have particular educational vulnerabilities.  They are more likely to be suspended, to be placed in a special educational setting, to leave school early, to have mental health problems as adolescents and adults, to become unemployed and homeless, and to enter the criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>In preparing our submission, we liaised with key stakeholders in the care system, including the Irish Foster Care Association and the Children's Rights Alliance.  I am also a member of the children in care and the education system national working group, led by Dr. Paul Downes, director of the Educational Disadvantage Centre in DCU.  This group is developing a policy paper on improving outcomes for children in the care system.  The group consists of members of the National Parents Council, various universities, homeless and children's charities, and teacher trade unions.  I thank this group of dedicated people, who took an interest in the care system.  I also thank my colleague, Mr. Shane Griffin, an advocacy manager in the Care Leavers Network Ireland, for his role in developing the submission.  Between foster homes and residential units, Shane had 19 placements within the care system, and I am delighted that he has joined me today.<br\/><br\/>To give some context, there are approximately 6,240 children in State care, of whom the State is the legal guardian.  This incorporates foster care, relative care and residential care.  Fewer than 10% of placements are in residential care, which are now small units, designed as close as possible to family homes.  On top of the disruption and uncertainty that comes with being taken into care, many children have had harmful life experiences beforehand.  Children taken into care typically suffer trauma, tragedy and loss.  Like Shane and me, they have had to be removed from their family homes by the State because of their family circumstances, for example, mental health issues, neglect, abuse, and drug and alcohol addiction.  Children in care and care leavers experience trauma, loss and attachment difficulties.  When trying to describe how it feels to be traumatised in this way, I say that it is similar to how Dorothy felt in the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in that it is like being removed from a home and an unhealthy situation and put into another unhealthy situation.<br\/><br\/>The education system is making matters worse for some children in care and fails to understand the challenges facing such children.  Within national strategies on educational disadvantage and access, such as the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019, developed by the Department of Education and Skills, there is no specific mention of children in care in spite of their being in the care of the State and being identified internationally as having poorer educational outcomes than the majority of their population peers.  We suggest, therefore, that this committee recommend a high-level national working group or task force to address specifically the cross-departmental responsibilities of the State to children in care and to develop a report, within approximately one year, on actions required to improve their educational outcomes.  This group would have the support of many stakeholders within the care system.<br\/><br\/>A report commissioned by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in 2013 pointed out that policymaking in respect of children in care needed to be based on evidence gathered systematically from the educational experiences of such children.  The creation of a category for children in care on the primary and post-primary online databases of the Department of Education and Skills would allow for the tracking and recording of the objective facts surrounding the education of children in care.  As the Ombudsman for Children noted in 2013:<\/p><blockquote>The specific deficit highlighted by this current study presents a serious impediment to evidence-informed policy-making and practice and needs to be addressed if effective policies, procedures and practices are to be put in place to mitigate the barriers to and in education that the literature indicates children in care can face.<\/blockquote> <p>We recommend a budget allocation to capture the outcomes of children in care within the educational system that can inform a strategy and policy development for the improvement of educational outcomes.<br\/><br\/>We also recommend that a designated teacher within a primary or secondary school should be a point of contact with the multidisciplinary team associated with the child in care.  This teacher should be trained in areas such as the legalities of the care system, attachment, trauma and admissions and enrolment policies, and should have an understanding of the challenges faced by foster parents and children in care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wayne Dignam"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I will remind Mr. Dignam of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#F00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527604200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will wrap up quickly.

The numbers are increasing year on year as students enter from second level, but there is a problem in that these supports are given on an add-on basis to disability support services.  Given the increasing numbers and the fact that these resources are fixed, the system is at breaking point.  Something has to change.<\/p> <p>  Objective 4 of the national access plan, that is, to mainstream equity of access to higher education, needs to be fully implemented.  AHEAD promotes a model of universal design for learning, UDL, for the inclusion of a diversity of students, for example, those with disabilities, mature students and international students.  Essentially, any student who learns differently.  This model is based on an architectural one that stands back and examines the needs of the user before designing a process.  We are asking curriculum designers and teachers to think of the variety of students who are sitting in their classrooms and to design their curricula and teaching processes to meet those students' learning needs in a mainstream environment.  It is about trying at classroom and faculty levels to include as many students as possible without adding on extra supports.<\/p><p>We believe about 40% of those students could be accommodated correctly with flexible teaching.<\/p><p> The teaching and learning forum is a body that operates under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  We would like the forum to be tasked with developing and promoting universal design for teachers.<\/p><p> Second, I would like to mention further education and training, FET and, in particular, the fact that 11% of school leavers with special educational needs go into further education and 4% of them go into higher education.  Yet, in further education, those students have lower points.  They are probably only within the 200 to 300 framed points.  They have much more complex needs while mental health problems are on the increase.  These students are going into an FET system, which is a good educational system but which has no systematic supports for students with disabilities.  The only programme out of 26 that has additional funding is the post-leaving certificate, PLC, programme and that exists within the further education system.  It is not an ideal situation and many students with disabilities do not get the supports they need in further education.  We recommend that strategic funding be allocated to the further education sector in order that colleges can set up a systematic support and recognise what the reasonable accommodations of students are, and upskill teachers.  Otherwise, those students will not be reasonably supported and the colleges will not meet their legal obligations under the UN Convention on Human Rights.  Without that funding, those students will not be correctly supported.<\/p><p> Third, we would like State funding allocated to programmes for students with an intellectual disability in higher education.  The world has greatly changed for students with an intellectual disability.  It is recognised that they have the capacity to learn and join programmes at further and higher education levels.  All levels of education must reflect the full diversity of the community.  Students with an intellectual disability have the same rights as other students to have a choice of education provision.  Currently, 11 higher education institutions provide programmes for students with an intellectual disability.  However, the programmes are all funded by philanthropic sources.  Basically, they are funded by rich people.  We depend on such goodwill but that could change from day to day and is unsustainable.  The students involved are reaching their potential and due to the learning that has taken place the change that they experience is huge.  They are going on fully paid work placements with companies such EY, which is changing public perception about such students.  We want the State to fund these programmes in order that these students can learn just like anyone else and reach their potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Heelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Heelan.

Likewise, I will not go into our submission <i>per se<\/i>but I will put it in context in respect of barriers faced by Travellers.<br\/><br\/>To understand the barriers of education for Travellers we must look to the State's engagement with them from the foundation of the State, particularly from 1963 onwards.  From the beginning, Travellers were denied ownership of their position.  This is obvious in the Irish Folklore Commission's survey of 1952.  In this document, the sedentary members of society were given the opportunity to speak, to name and place them, and to deny them the ownership of their position in the broader sphere of Irish society.  The document to this day is used by academics both at home and abroad as a starting point in their academic discourse on Travellers, yet at no time have Travellers been given an opportunity to respond to the ready-made representation of the commission's respondents.  From this we see how Travellers were to become idealised and denigrated, and made into an object of representation and investigation.  At no time do we hear the voice of the Traveller in this document.<br\/><br\/>From this point onwards there was a deepening interest in the Traveller community and the State taking a more active role in &quot;the problem of Travellers&quot;.  I use this phrase openly, as this was how the State viewed my community.  This culminated in the Government Report of the Commission on Itinerancy in 1963. The voice of the Traveller is again not represented in this report.  The opening statement in the document in which the Chairman of the commission addresses the members of the commission is more disturbing .  The statement makes it clear that the solution to the Traveller problem is the complete absorption of my community:  &quot;The fact that there can be no final solution of the problems created by itinerants until they are absorbed into the general community&quot;.  We must see this as the starting point when we consider the barriers that are faced by Travellers when accessing education.  This open and transparent assault on my community's way of life and identify must be acknowledged as a major contribution factor to the exclusion of Travellers from the educational institutions.  For us to respond to the serious issues that Travellers face in their everyday lives, we must accept that the State needs to look at the issue of reparations.  We must acknowledge this injustice, as we have acknowledged the injustices that was perpetrated on the women who were institutionalised in such places as the Magdalen laundries.  Fifty years of State-sponsored denial of Traveller identity and culture has not only impacted on educational attainment but also has created an internalised oppression, barriers and lack of self-worth in my community.  <br\/><br\/>Traveller ethnicity has been recognised since March 2017.  Such recognition on its own does not acknowledge or repair the damage that has been inflicted on the Traveller community by the State with its policies of absorption and assimilation.  The State, and its institutions, need to accept its direct role in the catastrophic damage inflicted on the Traveller community.  We must have an open, transparent and honest discourse on this matter like we have had in recent years about other State and institutional wrongs.  Our submission has, to some extent, outlined a number of recommendations and ways that we can move forward in partnership to achieve more equal and improved outcomes for my community in terms of education.<br\/><br\/>Finally, while addressing education, we must remember that the State's policies have also had a negative impact and created inequalities and poor outcomes for my community in other areas such as health, employment, accommodation, culture and language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Nevin"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nevin for his presentation.

We provide support, information and a range of services to people who parent alone, those who share parenting, those going through separation, as well as to people experiencing an unplanned or crisis pregnancy.  Lone parents experience multiple disadvantages in Irish society.  Barriers to education are a central part of this systemic disadvantage. <\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to submit to the joint committee and the time to focus on one-parent families who comprise a quarter of all families in Ireland.  One in five children lives in a one-parent family.  Social and economic isolation and exclusion affect lone parents in a disproportionate way.  Both national and international research repeatedly identifies lone parent families as a group with the highest risks of consistent poverty.<\/p><p>One Family recognises that family forms are changing internationally, with an increase in divorce rates, more separated families sharing parenting, as well as people parenting alone.  The traditional breadwinner family model has always carried economically hidden carer work.  One-parent families simply make visible what was previously invisible.  We see the everyday impact of this in our work and can see the pressures on lone parents who are always both carers and breadwinners.<\/p><p> National policies aimed at reducing poverty identify \"active inclusion\" and \"activation\" as key ways to bring marginalised people towards education, the labour market and employment.  One-parent families clearly demonstrate the central stumbling blocks to these policies.  The caring work involved in raising children takes time, resources and energy.  The idea of a lone parent in isolation as a fully available worker is a myth and the necessity for a whole-of-government web of supports and services is by now fully acknowledged.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the case of access to education.  Lone parents are caught in a system which seems to subvert their every attempt to access and complete the education they want and need to progress in life and improve outcomes for themselves and their children.  This is concerning, as education rates for lone parents decrease in recent years.  Taking an education-first approach will improve employment rates for one-parent families in the longer term.<\/p><p> The specific needs of lone parents to succeed in their educational goals are well known by most.  They are secure and affordable housing, flexible and affordable quality childcare, student grants and scholarships provided at realistic levels for parents, high-quality support by Intreo case officers and on-campus supports, which again acknowledge the specific needs of lone parents as students and carers.  These are detailed not just in One Family&rsquo;s written submission but also in Maynooth university&rsquo;s review.  There are many opportunities to increase lone parents' participation in education but a few obvious issues need to be urgently resolved.  The Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection need to collaborate and resolve issues relating to housing tenure and access to various grants, and cross-departmental integration on this is crucial.  The inequity for lone parents who have transferred to the back to education allowance, BTEA, must be addressed.<\/p><p> There is an urgent need to train Intreo front-line staff and case workers on the complex requirements of services required and supports available to lone parents.  There is also a need to recognise the need for and fund specialist bridging programmes such as those provided by One Family and others as part of the education-first pathway for lone parents.  Finally, we must improve access to education for those lone parents highlighted in the recent Indecon report who have been forced into low-paid precarious work as a result of the one-parent family payment reforms, many of whom are in receipt of the working family payment and cannot access the BTEA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Valerie Maher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We all recognise that there are many lone parent families within our system for all the different reasons outlined.

The Spiritan Asylum Services Initiative, SPIRASI, is a national rehabilitation centre for asylum seekers and refugees with a special emphasis on victims and survivors of torture.  SPIRASI has been involved with this group since 1999 and has since then been supported by the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, the Health Service Executive, the United Nations and the Spiritans or Holy Ghost Fathers who founded this project.<\/p> <p>  We focus on the rehabilitation of the whole person with psychotherapy, education and integration being our specific focus.  Due to the nature of the rehabilitation process, we require teaching skills that exceed the expectations of teachers from mainstream schools.  We require teachers who are comfortable teaching a mixed level group where learners have varying degrees of language and literacy needs.  Key to this is an ability to create a lesson plan that suits the language and literacy needs of the learner with a special focus on living in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Between September and June of every academic year, our four accredited Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, English classes and one volunteer-run class mean 120 learners attend SPIRASI.  We also run an accredited QQI computer class and a non-accredited knitting and art class.  We work mainly with a traumatised and vulnerable group of people who have gone through the difficult process of leaving their countries of origin and who now have to start learning a new language.  Many of our learners have never had the opportunity to go to school or come from a background where their education was cut short because of war or persecution.  We also work with educated professionals who are hoping to improve their English language ability and gain the essential skills that will help them to get their lives back on track.<\/p> <p>  It has been a unique opportunity for us to be invited to send a submission and speak about barriers to work.  We mentioned financial, motivational, information, cultural and accommodation matters and in doing our work, we face many challenges.  For example, there are approximately eight hours of teaching classes per week, which is not enough for this group of people.  The mixed levels can lead to difficulties, as there may be people with only a little English, or there may be a class with a doctor and somebody who has never been to school.  That poses a difficulty.  Teachers must also deal with issues such as trauma-related problems, as our profile includes survivors of torture.  We need to get teachers like Mr. Glennon in the Gallery, who has spent ten years teaching in SPIRASI and can understand the vulnerability of these people and how to support them.<\/p> <p>  We truly appreciate this opportunity and we hope we will continue to get the funding we have been getting in order to continue the work.  Training should be extended to other teachers.

Some members may be familiar with the Simon Community but for anybody who is not, we are a network of communities providing local responses to local needs and issues of homelessness all around the country.  We are based in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, the midlands, the mid-west, the north west and the south east.  I will focus on some issues, pulling out some of the main points from our submission.  I am conscious of the similarity with some of what others have said and I will try not to overlap.<\/p> <p>  People who are homelessness and at risk are among the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in society.  It is important to highlight that we are speaking of a diverse group of people.  People might speak about the \"homeless\" but we are talking about women, men, young people, families, those with complex needs, both mental and physical, and people with problematic drug and alcohol use.  It is important to look at those diverse needs in trying to respond effectively.  According to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, approximately 10,000 people were trapped in emergency accommodation in March 2018.  There is controversy about those figures and I will not get into that.  However, those figures include those in section 10-funded accommodation.  It is a particular funding stream and it does not include the hidden homeless, including those who are doubling or tripling up, staying with friends and relatives, those who are sleeping rough and a range of other people.<\/p> <p>  Every day in the Simon Community we can see that educational issues contribute to the causes of homelessness and they can also be a consequence of homelessness.<\/p><p>Clearly, education is a protective factor which can offer a pathway out, along with other supports, including stable and secure housing.  Research shows clear links between educational attainment and homelessness.  According to the 2016 census, 38% of those enumerated as homeless had ceased full-time education and did not have an educational qualification beyond lower second level, with 26% of this cohort educated to primary level only.  The impact of such low levels of educational attainment is captured by the 2016 CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, data which show that individuals with lower levels of educational attainment had progressively lower incomes across the eight income categories analysed and ranked highest in terms of the three primary poverty indices.  There are strong links between poverty, homelessness and low educational attainment.  A study by the Partnership for Health Equity, entitled Homelessness: An Unhealthy State, illustrates the lack of educational supports for people experiencing homelessness, with only 1% of 570 study participants in receipt of a BTEA payment.  A 2012 study by Cork Simon Community entitled, Working it Out &ndash; Barriers to Education and Employment, involved 91 Cork Simon Community residents found that 65% of respondents had left school before completing the leaving certificate, with 13% attaining only primary education or below.  The study also found that 35% of respondents had low literacy levels with 85% of this cohort being early school leavers.  The strong links are again clear.  <\/p><p> What we see across Government strategies is fragmentation.  Departments are not all working together and the strategies are not interconnected.  The FET strategy does not explicitly include people who are experiencing homelessness as a named target group, for example.  The strategy considers homelessness as a dispositional or individual barrier rather than a structural one.  However, homelessness is about structural poverty and disadvantage.  Rebuilding Ireland, the action plan for housing and homelessness, contains a number of actions relating to the educational needs of children trapped in emergency accommodation, including access to early years services and school completion programmes as well as access to public transport.  While these are important, are they enough?  Given the 55% increase in childhood homelessness since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland, questions must be asked about the availability and staffing of these vital support services.  <\/p><p> The national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, broadly recognises the challenges facing early school leavers, a cohort that is over-represented among the homeless population.  This recognition is matched with appropriate commitments but does not name young people experiencing homelessness as a target group.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government made homelessness its cross sectoral priority for 2016, following discussion with the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures advisory council but additional education-focused commitments have not been named in the context of Rebuilding Ireland.  <\/p><p> People experiencing homelessness face multiple barriers to educational attainment.  These structural barriers serve to compound the experience of homelessness and prevent access to a vital pathway and transition out of homelessness.  These barriers include, but are not limited to learning difficulties and limited basic literacy and numeracy skills; high rates of early school-leaving and low levels of qualifications; a lack of active mentoring for FET participants; having to abandon educational goals to receive better financial and welfare supports, which leads to poverty and unemployment traps; and a lack of affordable childcare services for parents.  Participants in the Living in Limbo study, which examined youth homelessness, also cited having no fixed address or stable accommodation at various times, including unstable returns to the family home, diminished their ability to engage or re-engage with education and training programmes.  A further barrier is the chaotic, unsettling and transient nature of hostel environments. <\/p><p> Simon Communities in Ireland have a number of clear priority recommendations for this committee.  Access to education provides multifaceted protection.  It prevents housing instability and homelessness while also being an important element in supporting people to leave homelessness and housing instability behind.  Educational attainment is a necessary pathway to transition to employment, financial independence and housing security.  In our work we find that housing security is critical and in this regard, we make a number of specific recommendations, the first of which is an expansion of the Housing First targets.  The Housing First model involves the provision of a stable, secure home for the homeless person as quickly as possible, followed by the provision of other appropriate supports for the person within that home.  It is an effective model with an 85% success rate.  It must be ensured that person-centred education and employment supports are part of the supports provided to those in housing.<\/p><p> There needs to be a reassessment of Rebuilding Ireland's educational and school supports and targets aimed at children and families in emergency accommodation.  Educational supports must be provided to young people between the ages of 18 to 26 who are experiencing homelessness, given the impact of early school leaving on this cohort.  Consideration must be given to ways to make access to the BTEA scheme as easy as possible for adults experiencing homelessness in order that they can return to education and training.  We must increase childcare supports for all parents seeking to return to education and training.  There must be active inclusion of people experiencing homelessness in existing back to work and education and training programmes.  Increased access to secure, quality employment on completion of study or training programmes is needed.  What underpins all of this is access to affordable and secure housing.  It is almost impossible for people to access training and education or to take up employment if they do not have a secure place to call home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Randall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Randall for her presentation, which highlights the clear link between educational inequality and economic inequality.

I practised my presentation with that in mind, which I have never done before in my life.  I will try to be precise.  I thank the committee for the invitation to contribute.  I wrote a background paper, with the help of Dr. Margaret Crean, which identifies three levels which must be addressed in terms of policies for vulnerable groups.  These are the macro level of the State policy; the meso or medium level of institutions like the ETBs, schools as organisations, the Teaching Council and teacher education; and the micro level of the family.  My opening statement focuses on the macro level.<\/p> <p>  Ireland, whether we like it and despite our recent advancement, remains am economically unequal society at its extremes - the top 10% and the bottom 10%.  We have a large low wage economy, at 21%, which is higher than in many other European countries.  This means that we have huge numbers of people on low wages who often cannot access education on equal terms with others.  With regard to vulnerable groups, I will refer briefly to those with disabilities, because Ms Heelan did.  A study of people with disabilities by Ms Bernie Grummell and her colleagues at NUI Maynooth found that it is more middle class people who gain access to the university.  I am not surprised because they have had to overcome the barrier of disability.  Economic inequality has an impact on everyone, particularly vulnerable groups, including lone parents, although not everyone who is a single parent is poor.  It is important to remember that.  Likewise, not every refugee is poor.  However, poverty and economic inequality are the common denominators among those who are disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  In terms of making recommendations, we must have a concept of equality education proofing in terms of fiscal, housing, health, transport and other policies that impact on education.  That concept is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  We must also consider the intersectionality of inequality.  No group is singular in its identity.  For example, someone who has been in care has a care identity which often creates an effective inequality in the deprivation of care.  This is described in page 17 of my submission.  This is often also associated with multiple other deprivations because those who have been in care are often poorer and had no power or control over their own lives when they were children.  Such people are not singular in their identity.  They are not only boys or girls, or only young or old.  When we talk about policymaking, therefore, we must not treat groups, including vulnerable groups, as if they are singular in their identity.<\/p><p>As a result of that, education is a competition for advantage in an unequal society.  That is how it works, whether we like it or not.  Those who are most resourced culturally, not just economically, in terms of social networks and social capital are most advantaged.  We must recognise that and try to address it.<br\/><br\/>The point I am making is a theoretical one about the relational nature of inequality.  In this competition for advantage, we have employed, as has Europe, a liberal equal opportunities framework.  That is welcome and important.  It gives everybody an equal formal right.  However, giving everybody such a right often only gives us a right to it; it does not enable us to access it.  I have argued in the paper for the importance of equality of condition as a concept.  It is not that we would not have equality of opportunity, but in an unequal society, the compelling evidence is that we do not have it.  The most recent research published by Dr. Delma Byrne and Dr. Selina McCoy in<i>American Behavioural Scientist <\/i>shows that over the generations in Ireland the relative class privilege has been maintained, which is hugely significant.  We have done great things in education in Ireland but that is a problem.<br\/><br\/>The big issue that is emerging in the international literature is not that we do things that badly in school and college - we do much that is good - but the role private money is playing in creating economic inequality in educational attainment.  If people have a salary of &euro;100,000 after tax and somebody else has a salary of &euro;15,000, they will use their private resources to advantage their own children in an unequal society.  There is a sociological law, just as there is an economic law, which we often forget.  People will do that.  The more inequality we have, the more people will buy services on the private market.  I refer to Irish and music, two concrete examples from the leaving certificate.  If one is not in an Irish speaking family it costs nearly &euro;1,000 to send one's child to the Gaeltacht for three weeks a year to become proficient in Irish.  It costs almost the same to get a class of an hour a week for 30 weeks for one's child to become proficient in the performance of music.  Those public examinations depend, for 50% in each case, either on oral proficiency or on musical performance.  Those who do not have money are severely disadvantaged.  That is very important.  It is why I talk about the importance of equality of condition and the link between taxation, fiscal and other policies.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make a few points about the meso level.  We need to support equality of condition and new thinking in education.  I gather the Education (Disadvantage Committee) Bill 2017 is before the House.  Under that legislation, as with the Education Act 1998, the only people who have to be considered in setting up the committee are the patrons, parent bodies, national bodies, management bodies and trade unions.  Civil society organisations that represent the vulnerable at grassroots level, like the people appearing at this meeting, should have a place in framing that legislation.  Equally, the same should arise with the Education Act and perhaps that might be amended at some time.<br\/><br\/>In addition, we need national statistical data.  Between 2003 and 2011, many of us wrote about having national statistics that are disaggregated not just by gender.  For the leaving certificate and the junior certificate, at the very least, we should have all groups such as children who are deaf, who have various different disabilities because they are not all the same, Travellers, children who have been in care and all that information-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Kathleen Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I ask Professor Lynch to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#K00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527604200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We need national data, otherwise we cannot make policy at that level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Kathleen Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Professor Lynch made the case well about the need for national data.

I am an adult education guidance counsellor and I am chairman of AEGAI to advocate on behalf of clients of our service and the members who deliver that service.<\/p> <p>  I work as a guidance co-ordinator for the adult educational guidance and information, AEGI, service in Carlow town and I am an employee of Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board, KCETB.  KCETB supports the needs of vulnerable adult learners on a daily basis though its course and programme provision.  As an adult guidance service, the AEGI service is free to those who are unemployed and underemployed and to all those out of work from the age of 16 years to post-retirement age in the community.  The service is professional, impartial, confidential and person-centred.  We facilitate service users to achieve their career and learning goals as well as facilitating lifelong career management and resilience techniques.  We develop people's awareness of possibilities and match them with appropriate progression routes which enable them to construct their own career journeys and achieve their desired career outcomes.  Funded through SOLAS and located within the 16 ETBs, there are 39 AEGI services nationally employing approximately 100 staff.  We work with 52,000 beneficiaries annually.  The adult guidance counsellors in the AEGI are all professionally qualified to postgraduate level.<\/p> <p>  Many of our service beneficiaries find themselves in a vulnerable position for myriad reasons, as has been mentioned.  Primarily, we assist people to upskill by identifying suitable options and by sourcing the relevant up-to-date impartial information to help them overcome barriers.  These barriers could include underlying learning difficulties, gaps in previous educational experience, financial constraints, family responsibilities, disability, mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, homelessness, drug or alcohol dependency and lack of self-confidence or self-belief.  Service users may have been referred to AEGI by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection Intreo case officers, ETB centre programme co-ordinators, managers and tutors, HSE occupational therapists, clinical psychologists, National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, educational psychologists, homeless hostel key workers, direct provision centres, psychotherapists or through word of mouth by a friend or self-referral.<\/p> <p>  Our clients may be long-term unemployed and have multifaceted needs.  No individual is singular in their identity and that should be taken on board in policymaking.  They may have dropped out of education between 16 and 18 years of age or they may be adults who lost their job and find that their current zero-hour contract roles do not fulfil their needs.  Men and women who may have cared for young children or those who looked after elderly relatives and are seeking to upskill and reintegrate into the world of work may also use our service.  We assist people to be actively involved in developing a career, to reacquaint themselves with the recent changes in the world of work and to develop career resilience and career management skills that last.  We provide guidance counselling and support and facilitate applications for education, training, apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities.  We help people to find appropriate work experience and internship placements and provide psychometric testing, curriculum vitae, CV, preparation and information on rights and entitlements.<\/p> <p>  The 39 AEGI services are run on a budget of just &euro;6.55 million annually, which is good value for money.  Recently, AEGI service workloads have increased due to Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection Intreo service referral protocols, and AEGI operational guidelines necessitate increased levels of service provision.  The amalgamation of the ETBs also resulted in expansion of guidance roles.  Anecdotal evidence from AEGAI membership nationally highlights enormous strain being experienced by AEGI services and indicates that any increase in workload would necessitate increased resources.  In the ongoing career guidance review, we sincerely hope that an interdepartmental approach will be taken and that our service can be appropriately resourced.  The reality of the impact we make where we assist progression up the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, can be seen not just in economic terms but in the ripple effect for communities, where one person going to college can influence their family and the wider community to pursue education and personal development as a means of exiting poverty and making an effective contribution to society.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate the opportunity to showcase the valuable contribution we make to vulnerable communities in helping them to take their place in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Rooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rooney.

The purpose of my presentation is to provide the committee with an overview of a range of interventions across the education continuum to meet individual identified educational need that is supported by the Department of Education and Skills.  A key priority for the Department is for education to be a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.  We have a wide range of policies and supports in place to tackle educational disadvantage from early years to primary, post-primary and further and higher education.<\/p> <p>  Inclusive education is a fundamental principle of our education and training system.  It is vital that all learners have the opportunity to benefit from education to help them fulfil their potential in life.  The Department early years education policy unit plays a support role in the ongoing development of the better start access and inclusion model, which was launched in June 2016 by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This model of supports is designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.  The model was developed and agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, our Department and the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  Implementation of the access and inclusion model is ongoing.  A total of 2,486 children received targeted supports in the 2016-17 ECCE programme year and 4,038 children are receiving targeted supports in the 2017-2018 ECCE programme year to date.  Through the work of the early years education policy unit, the Department continues to provide support to the access and inclusion model through participation in the project team on developments such as access and inclusion model inclusive play resources and the training working group convened to develop further training programmes in 2018.<\/p> <p>  At primary and post-primary school level a range of additional supports are available in mainstream settings to support the identified additional learning needs of pupils.  These are supplemented by further supports available under targeted support programmes such as the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, strategy.  DEIS is the Department's main policy initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at primary and post-primary level.  Following the recent review of the DEIS programme, a new DEIS plan was introduced last year that seeks to build on what has already been achieved by schools that have benefitted from the additional supports available under the initial DEIS programme introduced in 2005.  The two key elements of the 2017 plan are the development of a new identification process for the assessment of schools in terms of the socioeconomic background of the pupil cohort using centrally held data and the updating of the DEIS school support programme, which represents the overall suite of supports available to schools participating in the programme.<\/p> <p>  The ambition set out in the DEIS plan 2017 is for Ireland to become the best in Europe at harnessing education to break down barriers and stem the cycle of inter-generational disadvantage by equipping learners to participate, succeed and contribute effectively to society.  There are now 902 schools in the DEIS programme, including 704 at primary level and 198 at post-primary level.  The Department is investing over &euro;125 million in 2018 in the range of additional supports provided to DEIS schools.  These supports are detailed in the DEIS plan.  The latest retention report issued by the Department statistics unit shows an increase in leaving certificate retention rate for DEIS schools from 82.7% for the 2009 student cohort up to 84.41% for the 2010 cohort.  Since 2005, the non-DEIS schools leaving certificate retention rate has been between 91.7% and 92.9% while the retention rate increased from 78.4% to 84.4% for DEIS schools in the same period.<\/p> <p>  While this represents a strong increase and a narrowing of the gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools, it is evident that a gap still remains.  Equity of access to further and higher education is a fundamental principle of Irish education policy and one that has been endorsed by successive Governments in policy statements and commitments over the past 30 years as a national priority.  The Further Education and Training Strategy 2014-2019 and the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 work on breaking down barriers for target groups to enrol in and complete their chosen areas of study.  The Department provides funds for the demand-led student grant scheme.  This scheme will support approximately 78,000 post leaving certificate, undergraduate and postgraduate students in the academic year 2017-2018 at a cost of approximately &euro;370 million.  In addition to the scheme, students in third-level institutions can access the student assistance fund and the fund for students with disabilities.  We have recently established the programme for access to higher education as well.  The student assistance fund provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted toward the cost of rent, child care costs, transport costs and the costs of books and class materials.  The fund for students with disabilities supports participation by students with a disability in full-time programmes of further and higher education.  In the 2016-17 academic year the student assistance fund benefitted 16,019 students at a cost of &euro;7.99 million and the fund for students with disabilities benefitted 11,881 students at a cost of &euro; 10.4 million.<\/p> <p>  The programme for access to higher education fund comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education.  The fund is allocated on a competitive basis to higher education institutions to support particular priority areas as determined by the Department.  The &euro;16.2 million secured through the budgetary process has enabled three strands of the fund to be rolled out.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, a budget allocation of almost &euro;638 million was provided for SOLAS-funded further education provision.  A total number of 324,503 opportunities were made available to learners from SOLAS-funded further education and training programmes and services in 2017.  Of the 324,503 total places made available, 54,189 were specifically for the provision of community education.<\/p> <p>  Significant progress has been made in increasing participation in education by most socioeconomic groups.  However, some groups continue to be under-represented.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present.  I look forward to any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dolan very much.

I put forward this session but it is unfortunate that the legislation was put in today as well, and that will take me out for a few minutes.  I apologise for that, but I have read all the transcripts.  This is an area close to my heart.<\/p> <p>  One of my questions is for Mr. Nevin.  The Chairman that said we have come a long way since 1963.  My first inclination is to disagree with that.  Many years of oppression were placed on a community who were basically deskilled and disempowered.  The deficit is so big that it takes more than ethnicity and recognition to roll back the layers of oppression and that to which the latter has given rise for this particular group.  Can Mr. Nevin talk a little more about what acknowledgement of that oppression would mean?  Traveller children were in institutions that rejected them for so long.  Consequently, a great deal of healing is required in terms of recognition of identity and the years of oppression that existed.  Perhaps Mr. Nevin could talk a little more about that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dignam referred to a cross-departmental working group.  That is a positive idea.  Professor Lynch referred to the intersection of it all and how poverty is a common denominator.<\/p><p>Would Mr. Dignam see that working group representing all those groups across which poverty and disadvantage are common denominators rather than only considering care leavers?  Would he also see it examining the commonality across all the groups in terms of barriers to education?  He might address the way in which the working group might engage with the stakeholders?<\/p><p>I do not believe Professor Lynch has ever said anything with which I have disagreed.  A sentence in her submission reads, \"There is a need for a systematic review and regulation of the private for-profit education market in Ireland at all levels of education.\"  If there was reform in that area, I would be eager to know what it would look like.  How do we tackle the issue of advantage?  When I was elected to the Seanad, my wages increased and straight away I paid for advantage for my daughter in that I paid for her to have grinds, which I would not have been able to afford a few years ago.  I went from being a lone parent in poverty to using the advantage and cultural capital I had gained.  I was very aware that her classmates in school would not have that advantage.  My 11 year old daughter, who is much younger, will never face the barriers her older sister had to face.  How do we tackle that issue?  Is the private not-for-profit education market an area in which we might begin to tackle that issue?  I have to leave briefly as I have to second a measure in the Seanad but I will read all the contributions, and I will be back later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#L00400","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to bank those questions.

I am interested to know if Mr. Dignam, Ms Heelan and Mr. Mokake currently have direct liaison with the Department of Education and Skills?  Would they have a contact they would telephone and who would telephone them on issues related to care leavers, refugees or asylum seekers?  Would Ms Heelan have such a contact regarding issues concerning people with disabilities?<\/p> <p>  It would be no harm if Mr. Nevin could describe the statistics in terms of the levels of educational disadvantage.  I know he is weary doing so but they are shocking.  There should be shocking in terms of the gap in education between the Traveller community and the general population in education and the impact that has.  He might also outline the recommendations he particularly wants us to take note of today?<\/p> <p>  I would interested if Ms Maher could describe the poverty traps and the way in which the return to education grant is not working particularly well with working family allowance and the impact that has.  What liaison does she have with the Department?<\/p> <p> Is Ms Randall aware of a forum where the crossover between housing and education is discussed and explored at policy level?  Does she have a direct line to the Department of Education and Skills and does it have a direct line to her?  Could she give some examples of what is working?  I know that in Cork Simon Community there are some examples of where things do happen.  Also, can they be used as models?  Mr. Shane Rooney is in the land of dealing with interdependencies as well.  Professor Lynch particularly highlighted that it is impossible to examine educational disadvantage without examining wider society.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in Mr. Dolan's description of the number of the DEIS schools.  The fact that we have so many is surely an example of our failure.  We should not have any.  We should not need to have schools where we take special care of the pupils in them in that way.  There is the issue of the intersectionality and the interdependencies.  Is there an interdepartmental group in the Department of Education and Skills that works on policy development in this area?  Is Mr. Dolan open to some of the specific proposals Ms Heelan put forward such as, for example, in respect of access to higher education for young people with disabilities?  Who makes the policy on disadvantage?  Who is involved in that?  On what is it based because a common theme seems to be that there are huge DEIS deficits on which to base a solid policy.

One can see the difference in children at primary level who have access to programmes such as the school completion programme and those who do not have such access.

I cannot understand the reason it is not available in all schools, particularly the element of counselling and play therapy around mental health issues.

Following the thread Senator Kelleher spoke of regarding disadvantage and how it is defined, I have had many arguments with the Department of Education and Skills, even in respect of the DEIS scheme.  I do not understand why some schools were excluded from that scheme.  The idea of inclusive education also possibly needs to be redefined.

At the moment, for example, we know that immigrant children are concentrated in a relatively small number of schools and in large urban areas.  The same happens with a lot of Travellers.  Some schools have no measures to take on children who are different, or outside the typical white Irish student body.  They do not have to supply them and are not necessarily sanctioned for not taking them on.  That would be a mechanism and it is certainly deployed.<\/p><p> Another point I mentioned in my submission is that to have a holistic approach, the Teaching Council should have a role to play as the body responsible for teacher professionalism and development.  It should have a role in educating people and requiring that they are reflective learners through in-service training.  Europe had a big project 25 years ago, in which I was involved.  It recommended that all teachers would be evaluated on their classroom practice of equality and social inclusion as part of their evaluation as a teacher.  I think that is highly salient.  It is not about just one approach.

We have targets, and certainly in higher education they are being met, albeit less so in further education.  Students are getting in, there are no two ways about it.  They are moving through the system and getting into the colleges.  However, one of the problems, certainly in regard to students with disabilities, mature students and international students, is that the central system has not really changed.  The mechanism for teaching, as somebody mentioned earlier, is that if we throw knowledge at them, most of them will learn anyway.  Fair enough.  However, we must consider vulnerable groups such as students from foster care and Travellers.  There is a lot of students who need to be taught in a different way.

It rings true for the people experiencing homelessness with whom we work.  I will come back to the point Senator Kelleher raised about intersectionality at a departmental level.  There is a national homelessness consultative committee.  The idea of that is to acknowledge the cross-cutting nature of homelessness and to ensure there are interdepartmental responses.  The challenge is that this committee has not been meeting.  That means that the opportunity to identify shared barriers and quick solutions is not being allowed.  I think some pressure to encourage this committee to meet would be really beneficial.<\/p> <p>  As Senator Kelleher identified, there are excellent examples across Simon Communities Ireland of supporting people back into education, training and employment.  They really work.  They really make a difference, and one can really clearly see that education, training and employment is a pathway out of homelessness.  It is a way to support people to access secure accommodation, which is really difficult at this point in time with the housing market as it is.  It is a way to ensure that people do not return to homelessness in the future.  A lot of it is based on excellent links on the ground at a local level, including education and training boards and community employment.  Local employers are fantastic at engaging with people and being willing to take what they feel is a big risk in taking people on.  It really does make a difference.  <\/p> <p>  It is really difficult at present for organisations like my own and for all the organisations working on responding to the housing and homelessness crisis.  We are working in the eye of the storm.  We have increasing numbers turning to us every single day.  There is a huge amount of pressure.  We are working really hard to deliver housing solutions, to identify ways to ensure that there is more emergency capacity and to try to support people.  We are also trying to ensure that we are looking at the bigger picture by supporting people out of homelessness into secure housing, training, education and employment.  It is important to note that because it is a massive challenge at this point in time with the numbers we are talking about.  It is critical to mention how important secure and stable housing is to ensuring people can access education, training and employment.  It is very clear that unless someone has a place to call home, he or she does not have stability, security or certainty.  There are a lot of people who are stuck in the private rental sector or who are staying with friends or relatives.  They are dealing with such uncertainty that they could not even think of taking on an education or training programme until they have much more stability in their lives.  One of the key focuses has to be on ensuring that people have access to affordable and secure housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Randall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527604200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I want to respond to Senator Ruane, as well as to the point that 1963 is a long time ago.  It may be, but Travellers are living with the consequences of that document.  It was the blueprint for what was to follow, namely, 50 years of assimilation and absorption, 50 years of denial of one's identity, denial of who we were as a people.  Travellers were informed at a State level, an institutional level, a local level and a community level, that they were failed settled people.  All the statistics relating to Travellers show this in terms of health, mental health, suicide and education.  Some 92% of Traveller women have left second-level education, primarily before gaining a leaving certificate.  The figure for Traveller men is 95%.  That is clear indication of the consequences of people being denied their entire way of life and who they are.  While 1963 may be a long time ago, I use that particular date because that is the date when the State officially set about its course of absorption and assimilation of Travellers.<\/p> <p> On ethnicity, 1 March 2017 was a wonderful, fantastic day, with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, standing up in the D&aacute;il and acknowledging Traveller ethnicity.  However, it has to go further.  We have to discuss the issue of reparations to repair the damage suffered by Travellers at an individual level and a community level.  Senator Kelleher asked me for some recommendations.  I have a few.  Most of them are quite basic.  We need a culturally appropriate primary school programme and the reinstatement of resource teachers for Travellers.  In 2011, the entire Traveller education budget was cut.  If there is one thing I am really keen on, it is something aimed at Traveller men, something that supports them to take pride in who they are and their culture.<\/p><p>It has to be specific training projects for young Traveller men.  Traveller organisations should be resourced to develop a national network committed to supporting Traveller men in engaging in culturally appropriate education initiatives.  The State must acknowledge its part, and the institutions' roles, in the denigration of a people and their way of life.  I do not want to harp on about this too much but it is key.  My father, who passed away quite recently, said to me that, prior to 1973, the majority of Travellers did not depend on social welfare.  They were independent, self-reliant and self-resourced.  Albeit hard and arduous, they were a self-sufficient people.  Within a space of ten years, from 1963 onwards, we became the very parasites that in some cases we have had politicians accusing us of being.  The State must acknowledge its role in that.  We must address it and reparations must be a key element of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Nevin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527604200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I want to comment on something Senator Ruane said around cultural capital.  I want to reiterate and reflect what she said, that we also see where a person is able to improve his or her education advantage because of having cultural or social capital.  We see that a lot around a lone parent who may or may not have family supports, whether financial, emotional or psychological.  Where such supports from the people around them are absent, lone parents are much less likely to engage in education or, indeed, may begin their educational journey and then end up dropping out of their course.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher asked about the poverty traps, specifically around the working family payment and access to the back to education allowance.  We included that as one of our recommendations because the Indecon report, which reviewed the impact of the one parent family payment reforms, indicated a number of alarming statistics.  Of course, there was an increase in employment and a decrease in welfare dependency but there was also an increase in poverty.  Specifically, there was a statistic in the report showing that lone parents in full-time work since the reforms had come into place were experiencing deprivation and in-work poverty.  We would like to see those parents having a clear and direct pathway into education if they wanted to improve their earning capacity.  Many of them are in low-paid and precarious work and at present, for example, if they wanted to access the back to education allowance, the working family payment - formerly family income supplement - is not one of the qualifying payments for that support.<\/p> <p>  What representatives from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have said to us is that such persons have the option to leave their job and move on to jobseeker's transition or jobseeker's allowance and then they can apply for the back to education allowance, if that is what is relevant.  We would say that is counterintuitive.  It also creates a lot of fear and uncertainty for lone parents because we are asking them to leave their job, wait until they qualify for a payment, and nobody will tell them if they will or not until they get that decision.  Then they must also think about how can they afford their housing, their childcare, their travel to and from their place of education, and the books and materials that are needed.  Quite frankly, lone parents do not want to jump off that cliff.  When we are giving them information on their rights and entitlements, we cannot give them certainty.  We can say that they might get access to this childcare place, this VTOS place or this education allowance, but in many instances there are no guarantees of that.  They are literally waiting until September or October and they have already had to jump off that cliff.  One can understand that many parents do not want to do that when they are the sole breadwinners and the sole carers.  We could make it a little easier for them.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher asked about involvement in the consultation on educational policy, and the Chair asked a similar question.  A number of cuts were brought in since budget 2012 around educational supports for lone parents.  One Family, as the national organisation for one-parent families, certainly was never consulted on any of those cuts before they happened.  I will admit we do not have as strong a contact with the Department of Education and Skills as we do with other Departments.  I would not suggest that is the fault of the Department of Education and Skills.  What I will say is that the benefit of having those contacts in Departments has certainly helped us in being able to advocate on behalf of the families that we represent and we would welcome having better contacts with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>  When the Chair asked whether we had one key recommendation, it is really around the back to education allowance and access to the SUSI maintenance grant.  It has been identified specifically in the research that the most economically vulnerable group is lone parents in receipt of the back to education allowance.  They need that additional financial support to engage in education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Valerie Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527604200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Kelleher's question about a liaison person in the Department.

Children in care, in themselves, are a particular sector because the State has direct responsibility for these children.  The State is their legal guardian.<\/p> <p>  The State, through the Child and Family Agency, does not know the educational outcomes of children in care.  There is no cross-departmental strategy for those children.  We come across it daily with foster parents, social workers and teachers.  Schools do not know what to do about a child in care.  What do they do about consent forms for school trips?  What do they do about a child who is misbehaving very badly because of post-traumatic stress disorder?  What can they do?  What type of support can they get?  How can they deal with that?  Similar to what the previous speaker mentioned, there are programmes that can be specific for children in care but could be broadened out for homeless children or immigrant children as well.<\/p> <p>  If there is a cross-departmental task force, it also needs to look specifically at children in care because we have been forgotten in a lot of strategies.  As I said in my opening statement, the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education did not mention children of the State.  Even though it was a State strategy, it did not mention its own children.  From what we know from international research, the outcomes of children in education are bad.  Some of the programmes that we can look at can help more vulnerable children who are close to becoming children in State care through many different societal issues.  If we can help support teachers at primary level and secondary level, we can help those vulnerable children as well.<\/p> <p>  We do not have direct contact, to answer Senator Kelleher's question on direct contact, with the Department of Education and Skills on children in care.  That is also an issue in terms of the care system and representation of foster parents, care leavers and social workers.  It is varied.<\/p><p>That also needs to be joined up so there can be a correlation in terms of feedback going both ways as to what the problems are within the education system for children in care and for care leavers.  I would certainly welcome that.  In terms of the task force, we recommend that there would be a Department of Education and Skills liaison that could look at the cross-recommendations from the stakeholder group.  As I said in my opening statement, we are involved in a national strategy through the centre for disadvantage in DCU and we are getting great ideas from stakeholders, but we need to get that message across to Tusla and to the Department of Education and Skills in terms of what needs to be done to improve outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wayne Dignam","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I appreciate what Mr. Dolan said about the Department and having committees but under the legislation the only people who have a right of consultation are those who run the education system under the 1998 Act.  What concerns me is that the education disadvantage Bill will have representation from civil society but it will not have in its formation.  That is not the way it is set up.  What these groups are saying is that there are many civil society groups for whom the current procedure, which is not a statutory one because it is clearly informal, is not effective.  I know from research that the motto for people with disabilities in Europe is, \"Nothing about us without us\".  That is a very useful mechanism to deploy when one is planning and designing policies.  No matter how annoyed one might be by the civil society groups which appear before the committee, they usually have a message.  That is a very important issue for me and it is in my presentation.<\/p> <p>  An important question about DEIS was raised.  DEIS is a massive achievement; I do not doubt that.  I am so old I was involved in designing it in the early stages before many here were around.  It raises a big question, however.  Have we institutionalised inequality in the education system?  Let us say we had colour as the basis of determination of DEIS schools.  What would we say?  Would we say that was not segregation?  That is the question I am asking.  I am not blaming the Department of Education and Skills as this is a big policy consideration.  We have to look at whether we have institutionalised economic inequality in such a way that we say that those schools are grand for those poor kids and we will give them an extra bit of money.  However, we know - I will come back to the private market question - that we can buy education service in the private market and give advantage to our own children.  There is a question there.  It is not that the system itself does not function well - it does very good work - but have we institutionalised the inevitability of class and other inequalities in education such assistance?<\/p> <p>  I am greatly exercised as an academic over many years and as someone with an interest in policy about the lack of disaggregated data on the junior certificate and the leaving certificate.  Every year the results come out and we have no social class analysis.  The reason is that we have no data by social class.  Yet we have everybody's PPS number.  In many universities in the United States one is not allowed to register unless one gives one's full designations, including race, ethnic status, whether one is in the care of or in the leave of the state.  There is absolutely no reason we could not institutionalise that.  We can anonymise that because we have a very digitalised society.  I believe it would make a difference.<\/p> <p>  On the question about the private education market, it is a huge issue in this country.  There is a massive private education market.  I do not know the solution to it.  It operates as private business and, as we know, all the private education colleges are perfectly entitled not to disclose data to the HEA because they are private businesses and for profit.  There is a need for a review but I do not know whose responsibility it is.  I was asked to address a meeting of trade unions recently and I was told that in some schools, teachers leave the classroom but come back a few hours later to give private grinds at &euro;30 to &euro;40 an hour to children.  This would not be allowed in many other countries.  As I said earlier, music is almost an entirely private business.  If one wants to do well in performance in music in the leaving certificate, unless one happens to have someone in the family who is musically proficient - there are some schools which do it differently - one has to resort to private business.  That is what worries me - I made this point in my paper - about this proposal for continuous assessment.  It is a different concern from that of other people but once one takes assessment and provision for preparation for it out of school, one automatically advantages people who are more advantaged.  It has happened in other countries and it will happen here.  When it comes to competition for advantage, it is like the law of self-interest, as I have already said.<\/p> <p>  I have lived in a number other European countries, including Denmark, and one does not have the level of anxiety one has about public examinations here because there are alternatives.  Also, there is not that fear people in Ireland have that their children will end up with no job or no home, or with nothing.<\/p> <p>  If we allow our society to become more unequal, then we create a society of fear and fear drives parents, parents drive children and that drives the private market.  There are other issues about the private market that need to be looked at.  It is not my job to do that but it is a very big issue in Irish education.  To my knowledge, no studies have been done on it, no information is available and it is very hard to find any data on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Kathleen Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Lynch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018052900002#P00800","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1527604200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

All the evidence, however, suggests that if children are from a lower socio-economic group, their career prospects depending on where they are born are automatically lower than those of children from a middle-class or upper middle-class background who have the resources of private education and can get grinds.  Is it a question too of encouraging schools to admit a mixed socio-economic group so that everyone rises on the one tide, not to mention giving the other supports needed for vulnerable children and students, to avoid the institutionalised approach of, for example, students from one socio-economic background going to DEIS schools?  Having a mix of students from different cultural backgrounds makes for a better society.  That is another issue we need to consider.  There are some very good examples of schools trying to have that integration in Galway.  We need to eliminate the class idea that children from a certain area whose parents have means will succeed and their ability will be irrelevant because they have funding.

I am joined by my colleague Mr. Adrian Varley, head of the banking supervision: analysis division.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an overview of the recently published Commission package on non-performing exposures, NPEs, which was released in March 2018.  The proposals are a key aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to delivering on the Council of the EU&rsquo;s action plan on NPLs of July 2017.  The package comprises two legislative proposals: first, a proposal for a regulation amending the capital requirements regulation, CRR, which introduces minimum coverage requirements for incurred and expected losses on future non-performing exposures, NPEs, arising from newly originated loans; and, second, a proposal for a directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral.   Discussions on the proposals in the context of the European policymaking process are at an early stage.  The Central Bank of Ireland is evaluating the potential impact these proposals will have on the Irish market.  The Central Bank is also providing technical advice to the Department of Finance as part of these political negotiations and will continue to engage as discussions progress. <\/p> <p>  The level of NPLs increased significantly following the onset of the economic and financial crisis in 2007.  High levels of NPLs pose a significant threat to economic stability and to the orderly functioning of the banking system throughout the EU.  High levels of NPLs also result in loss of confidence in banks, making it harder for them to raise capital, borrow, reduce interest rates and make new loans to businesses and households.  Loan sales can play an important role in transferring risks from banks to other types of investors, which reduces vulnerability in the banking system.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank engages both at the European level within the European Banking Authority, in its standard setting capacity, and European Central Bank, ECB, Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, in its supervisory capacity, and at a domestic level via direct supervisory engagement with the banks to assist in the proposed responses to NPEs.  The specific proposals at hand will be subject to significant scrutiny as part of the European legislative process and are likely to be amended considerably in advance of their implementation into law. <\/p> <p>  The proposals aim to prevent the build-up of high levels of NPEs on banks' balance sheets, through the incentives produced by increased provisioning requirements, and to develop secondary markets for NPEs, with the aim of removing undue obstacles to loan servicing by third parties and to the transfer of loans to third parties.  The package also aims to enhance the speed of recovery of collateral for business loans through the introduction of an accelerated extrajudicial enforcement procedure, AECE. <\/p> <p>  The Commission's proposal for a regulation establishes a minimum coverage requirement whereby banks must put aside certain amounts to cover incurred and expected losses caused by loans that turn non-performing.  Where the bank does not meet the applicable minimum level, it will have to make a deduction from own funds.  The minimum coverage requirement increases gradually depending on how long the exposure has been classified as non-performing.<\/p> <p>  The proposal sets out different coverage requirements for secured and unsecured exposures.  When an NPE is secured, the required coverage levels for the secured part of the exposure can be phased in over a period of eight years, while unsecured exposures will be phased in over two years.  The Commission's reasoning for this differentiation is that recovery rates are on average significantly higher for secured NPEs than for unsecured ones.<\/p><p>It is also proposed that there would be different levels of coverage required depending on the criteria under which the exposure is classified as non-performing, for example, whether it is past due or borrowers are considered unlikely to pay.<\/p><p> Concerning the minimum coverage requirement, the Central Bank is broadly supportive of the policy direction of the Commission's proposal.  Without supervisory challenge, banks have been inclined to employ a wait-and-see approach with respect to provisioning, which means that new NPLs can build up to cause bank-specific or system-wide problems.  The Commission's proposal, which would apply only to new loans originating after 14 March 2018 that become non-performing, would ensure that banks had suitable levels of provision.  If the latter is not the case, they must hold appropriate capital in respect of this risk.<\/p><p> The second aspect of the package is a proposal from the Commission for a directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral.  The proposal standardises the regulatory regime by seeking to harmonise the definition, authorisation, supervision and conduct rules applicable to credit servicers and purchasers.  This legislative initiative aims to develop secondary markets for NPLs further, with the aim of removing undue barriers to loan servicing by third parties and to the transfer of loans to third parties.<\/p><p> The standardisation of a regulatory regime for credit servicers and credit purchasers is broadly supported, as the proposal states that the assignment of creditors' rights under the credit agreement should not affect the level of protection to consumers in any way.  To this end, the proposal provides that consumer protection rules will continue to apply in order to ensure the same level of protection irrespective of who owns or services the credit and irrespective of the legal regimes in force in the member states of the credit purchasers and credit servicers.  This high-level principle mirrors the objectives of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, which sets out the regulatory regime in respect of credit servicing firms and brings them into the Central Bank's regulatory remit.  Furthermore, the proposal does not require that credit purchasers must be directly authorised or regulated, but that they must appoint credit servicers or credit institutions that are regulated.  This is in line with the current legislative regime in Ireland, which requires an unregulated loan owner to appoint a credit servicing firm that is authorised and regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit servicing firms are subject to the Central Bank's statutory codes and regulations.<\/p><p> The second part of the proposal also aims to enhance the protection of secured creditors by introducing a more efficient method of realisation of security, called the accelerated extrajudicial collateral enforcement, AECE, procedure.  The aim of the AECE procedure is to increase the efficiency of debt recovery through the availability of an accelerated mechanism for the recovery of collateral for creditors of business borrowers only.  This procedure would be accessible when agreed upon in advance by both the lender and borrower.  It is not available for consumer loans or real estate serving as the borrower's primary residence and may only be effected where it has been explicitly stipulated in the original loan contract.  While banks can enforce collateral under national insolvency and debt recovery frameworks, the process can be slow and unpredictable in some countries.  The proposed mechanism is intended to introduce a more efficient mechanism while balancing the interests of creditors and borrowers.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.  We look forward to addressing their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McEvoy.

I thank it for the invitation to attend.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Brian Corr, Mr. Brian Fee, Mr. Timmy Hennessy and Mr. Eric Gargan.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the European Commission published a package of proposals in March to address NPLs.  This followed on the agreement by ECOFIN Ministers in July 2017 of an action plan to tackle NPLs in Europe.  As with any complex proposal, detailed analysis is required to understand the implications for Ireland and to inform our advice on Ireland's approach to these proposals.  Work is under way within the Department and the Central Bank on this.  The proposals are likely to change shape during the months of negotiation that are ahead.  We will engage constructively with that process, as we always do.<\/p> <p>  The Commission has put forward a package of proposals to accelerate the resolution of NPLs and prevent their renewed build-up.  The package includes a proposal for a regulation amending the capital requirements regulation and one for a directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral.  The proposals follow on from the Council conclusions and the legislative processes are at an early stage, with only one working group meeting having occurred so far.  The proposals are being prioritised, with the European Commission seeking completion before the end of the current Commission's term if possible, particularly of the regulation on minimum loss coverage.  The proposals interact with other proposals, agreed by ECOFIN last Friday, on risk reduction as part of the completion of the banking union.<\/p> <p>  I will summarise the proposals and briefly outline our preliminary views on each of the three aspects in the two legislative proposals.  The proposal for a regulation amending the capital requirements regulation would introduce common minimum coverage levels and require banks to put aside sufficient funds when new loans become non-performing.  The proposals are designed to ensure that in future there is not an excessive build-up of NPLs without sufficient loss coverage on banks' balance sheets.  Existing accounting rules and supervisory powers currently ensure that bank supervisors have several tools at their disposal to address NPLs in individual banks, and the existing regulations require banks to set aside capital to address NPLs.  The new regulation aims to complement this prudential framework and ensure consistency across the EU by introducing a common definition for NPLs and a common minimum backstop coverage level for newly originated loans that become non-performing.  The proposal will apply to new lending only and is designed to ensure that banks set aside sufficient resources when new loans become non-performing.<\/p> <p>  It is likely that, in the course of negotiation, there will be debate about a number of elements of the proposal.  For example, the regulation as drafted would require banks to provision NPLs for loans issued after mid-March 2018 up to 100% of a secured exposure after eight years and an unsecured exposure after two years.  It is the Commission's assessment that banks will move to address NPLs more efficiently, subject to appropriate safeguards for borrowers.  This is because, should the regulation be implemented in the manner proposed, it would increase the cost of holding NPLs over an eight-year time horizon and could entail banks amending their NPL reduction strategies, possibly by way of restructuring, implementing collateral enforcement and-or earlier loan sales.<\/p> <p>  This in turn leads us to the directive on credit servicing, credit purchasers and recovery of collateral, which can be broken down into two core elements: credit servicing and recovery of collateral.  The directive is intended to contribute to the development of secondary markets for NPLs by removing undue impediments to loan servicing by third parties and to the transfer of loans to loan purchasers while fully respecting existing civil law and member states' consumer protection rules.  The proposal sets common standards to ensure proper conduct by and supervision of credit servicers while allowing more competition by harmonising market access rules.  The directive provides that credit servicers authorised in a member state can provide their services across the EU, provided they are in compliance with the directive.  The proposal has limited rules for credit purchasers, including that they have to employ an EU-regulated credit servicer, have an EU-based representative and notify regulators of enforcement action.  The proposal, if implemented, would not allow any member state to impose additional rules on credit purchasers.<\/p> <p>  The proposal on recovery of collateral is intended to increase the efficiency of debt recovery procedures through the availability of a distinct common voluntary procedure, AECE, which is a tool to recover money from secured loans to business borrowers out of court.  This extrajudicial procedure would be accessible only when agreed upon in advance by both the lender and the borrower.  It will not be applicable to consumer loans or secured credit agreements concluded between creditors and business borrowers that are secured by the primary residence of the business borrower.  The proposal is designed so as not to affect preventive restructuring or insolvency proceedings and not to change the hierarchy of creditors.  We understand that the Irish legislative framework in this area is well functioning and, as a result, our priority is to ensure that the current framework is not negatively impacted upon.<\/p> <p>  Taken together, these legislative proposals comprise the core actions for the European Commission from the Council conclusions.  They will have limited impact in the short term, given that they apply to new loans, and on the current stock of NPLs, but they are intended to impact positively on the resolution of new NPLs in the future.<\/p> <p>  We are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tobin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#E00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

There are two aspects to my response, the first of which concerns process, governance and co-ordination.  There was a timing difference, meaning the SSM was keen to act quickly, with a wider scope and supervisory measures which were based more on bank-specific judgments on banks working out their NPL strategies, as the Senator suggests.  The Commission, some time after that process, came to the conclusion that change in the form of a regulatory response was required, which was narrower in scope.  That opens up a discussion as to why it only applies to new lending and why it will be a few years before it takes effect.  Essentially, that is a process answer.<\/p> <p>  In terms of substance, one of the issues is having a wide range of toolkits for transparency of risk.  We want a change in regulation in order that all banks are abiding by the same rules and we want to signal that well in advance so there are no surprises.  That is the Commission proposal but I reiterate that it is on new lending now that becomes non-performing in the future.  It does not relate to the current stock of NPLs.  The SSM measures are very much part of the supervisory toolkit which is now communicated better and more clearly to the industry.  There are two different and complementary, rather than contradictory, aspects to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Varley"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>What was the input of the Central Bank and the Department to those proposals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#F00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527606000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The Commission has the right of initiative in terms of proposals for directives.

The key point is to recognise the risk earlier, which is similar to the IFRS 9 discussion recently on the new accounting rules, and to transparently differentiate between the activities of banks in order that they recognise the risks in advance and build up appropriate reserves.  In that way, they can ensure that resources are available to deal with the initial problem, which can prevent a buildup.  If we look back at what happened in Ireland, we had the economic crisis, with people not being able to pay off their loans.  The sheer scale of the problem meant that banks were not dealing with it in terms of operations and good due diligence.  They did not have processes in place to allow them to intervene early with the borrowers to turn the problem around.  The idea of these measures is to make it punitive for the risk to build up.  The aim is to change the dynamic of people holding on to problems and hoping the property market turns around or to mitigate that incentive so that banks are clear that the costs must be realised earlier and they need to deal with the problem and engage with borrowers at an early stage.  The aim is to ensure lenders engage before borrowers even get into the later stages of arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Varley"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Surely that would mean that homeowners or landowners would lose their assets more quickly.

In the past in Ireland we have also done numerous assessments to see from a prudential view whether that is enough money, so factoring in more risk.  We have imposed that directly by persuading the banks to hold more money to capture the uncertainty in that assessment.  That is the local approach.  The regulation sets out an approach which does exactly the same process but the final step is that now the bank has to explicitly remove that amount of money - the difference we view, the gap - from its own funds.  That is the amount of capital it tells the market it has.  The new feature, of which I am very supportive, is how the bank comes out and tells the market it is safe, that 15% or 17% is already factored in.

The best way I can describe it is that the Commission proposal more or less seeks to do what the Oireachtas did in 2015 when we introduced credit servicing legislation.  The Commission considered the issue of loan owners but it did not really decide to go as far as the Private Member's Bill proposes to go.  The view of the Minister for Finance and the intention of the Department is to seek, as this process of discussion on the directive moves forward, to ensure that the directive when it is adopted is consistent with the Private Member's Bill.  In other words, the directive will also seek to regulate loan ownership as at the moment, it does not.  We will certainly press for it to go further than it does.  From my experience over the past 20 years of dealing with all kinds of directives I can honestly say that a directive never ends up where it starts, as I am sure the committee is aware.

There is probably ample opportunity for us to try to ensure our domestic legislation with the Private Members' Bill will be consistent with the ultimate directive.  Quite honestly, it is likely that issues around loan ownership will arise, particularly when this directive is discussed in the European Parliament.

How the final regime will look and what shape it will take is anybody's guess as it is a couple of years down the line.  The proposal is for a definition of a credit servicing firm, for the harmonisation of the authorisation supervision and for imposing conduct rules on credit servicing firms across the EU.  Some member states have a regime for that activity but others do not.  This directive would impose a level playing field across the board.<\/p> <p>  The proposals as currently outlined are not terribly dissimilar to the existing regime under the 2015 Act, where we already have a framework in place for authorising and supervising these firms in Ireland.  Once the directive becomes final and fit for national transposition we will undertake a mapping exercise to see what is contained in the directive, how it differs from our current domestic regime and how that domestic regime will need to change or otherwise to address the provisions of the EU directive.<\/p><p>As noted earlier, the European Union directive would be superior and trump domestic legislation in that context.

I make it clear to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank - I take the opportunity every time representatives are before us - that vulture funds are running rings around the legislation.  The credit servicing firms are doing the same thing.  The protection that should be there for the consumer does not really travel, as we can see in court cases.  People are being bullied and shoved in a direction to get them out of the property or cause them to give up on their circumstances.  There is no protection in that regard.  These people are doing their best to negotiate with a bank and fulfil an obligation that they may have entered into with a bank.  Nevertheless, they are not protected when the loan is sold on.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of AIB came before us a short time ago and told us they would not sell private homes of families and so on.  According to the emails we have, recent portfolios include homes nonetheless.  The question for the bank and the Department of Finance is what better transparency can we have?  It is important that the Central Bank and the Department of Finance representatives come before the committee, and that is their job, but as an extension the representatives of vulture funds and credit servicing firms should also appear before the committee on request.  It is fair.  The Irish people caught in this mess are working in the dark.  They believe they have cover and that the law is on their side in dealing with the banks.  Once people go to a vulture fund, it is game over as they do as they like.

Many individuals are experiencing premium increases. <\/p><p>As indicated in both the Oireachtas committee report on motor insurance and the working group's motor report, there is no legislative silver bullet to enable the Government to fix this problem immediately.  There are considerable efforts being made to address many of the issues in the insurance sector and I will highlight some of them today.  I look forward to hearing members' views and responding to the questions they may have. <\/p><p>By now, all members will be aware of the cost of insurance working group, which has been meeting since 2016.  This group has published two reports &ndash; the first in January 2017, focusing on the cost of motor insurance, and the second, on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, published in January of this year.  As part of the development of the two reports, the working group consulted a wide variety of stakeholders.  In addition, the Department of Finance and I have met and engaged with many groups, including the Alliance for Insurance Reform, to whose representatives members spoke last Thursday.  This ongoing consultation continues to inform the debate and the actions being taken.<\/p><p>The fifth quarterly update shows that of the 58 separate deadlines set across the two reports up to the end of quarter 1 of 2018, 48 have been met.  Substantial work has been undertaken in respect of the ten incomplete action points, the nine action points that are classified as &quot;ongoing&quot;, and the remaining action points with later deadlines.<\/p><p>These recommendations are wide in scope and aim to address issues such as the lack of transparency in the insurance sector, protecting the consumer, tackling fraud, improving the personal injuries claims environment and reducing costs in the claims process.  The reports also emphasise how important it is for industry to play an active role in contributing to this process through greater transparency, more active engagement with policyholders in regard to claims and greater challenging of questionable claims etc.  To date, 40 of the 71 action points in the motor report have been completed and eight of the 29 from the report on employer liability and public liability.  The latter were concluded at the end of quarter 1 of this year. <\/p><p>I will now highlight a number of issues that have been the focus of much of the discussion recently and will outline what is being done to address them.<\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>I acknowledge that many people are dissatisfied with the personal injury claims system and have sympathy with the view that too many claims are being settled in such a way that we know little about the value of such settlements.  Many take place on the court steps.  <\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>Both the motor and employer and public liability reports recognise this unhappiness with the system and there are a number of relevant recommendations to try to address these general concerns.  I will now provide a number of examples of what is being done.<\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>The general scheme of the personal injuries assessment board (amendment) Bill of 2017 is being drafted to address the issue of non-attendance at medicals and failure to provide particulars of special damages.  The purpose of this legislation is to strengthen the operational powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, in order to ensure greater compliance with the PIAB process and encourage more claims to be settled through it.<\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>Calls are frequently made for changes in regard to the book of quantum, particularly in regard to the size of awards.  I am sure this issue will be touched upon today.  While I accept this argument, I believe it is equally important to try to ensure consistency of award levels through the regular use of the book of quantum by all parties.  This should mean that, no matter what way a claim is settled, whether directly by an insurer, through PIAB or as a result of a court decision, the outcome should be broadly the same.  A number of recommendations from both reports are relevant to this general area:<b><i><\/i><\/b>reviews of the book will conducted every three years when a new statutory requirement in the PIAB (amendment) Bill becomes law; the Personal Injuries Commission is undertaking a benchmarking exercise that involves a comparison between international awards for personal injury claims and domestic equivalents and, in addition, recommendation 5 of the employer and public liability insurance report asks the Law Reform Commission to undertake research and analysis on the issue of whether it is justifiable and in the common good and legally and constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to enact legislation to delimit or cap the damages a court may award in respect of personal injuries.  <\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>The way in which personal injuries claims are processed within the court system attracts much criticism.  The report on employer liability and public liability refers to the issue of specific training in the assessment of damages in personal injuries cases.  What we are seeking here is to ensure that the Judiciary have access to appropriate training through a proposed amendment to the Judicial Council Bill and through other training mechanisms already in place.<\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>It is acknowledged that the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 has not been as effective as originally envisaged.  In this regard, a key recommendation of the report on employer liability and public liability insurance relates to section 8, in respect of which an amendment is being proposed to enhance the effectiveness of the statutory requirement to notify the defendant within one month of the incident by way of the initial warning letter and to align the provision with data protection legislation in terms of the retention of evidence, such as CCTV footage.  <\/p><p>Section 14 of the 2004 Act has the potential to be a powerful tool in fighting fraud because, if the provision is used, it should ensure that all parties to an action consider more carefully the evidence they are including in their pleadings as there will be a greater understanding that including false or misleading evidence, which they know to be false or misleading, may attract criminal proceedings and a potential conviction.  We have proposed an amendment to this section to allow for the court to draw inferences from non-compliance with the 21-day deadline to lodge the affidavit verifying that there are no false or misleading allegations in the affidavit sworn to ground the personal injuries claim.<\/p><p>The report also calls upon defendants to raise section 26 where they believe fraud and exaggeration has taken place in the claim.  In this regard, work is ongoing to ensure there is a clear procedure in cases where a judge determines fraud has taken place.  A &quot;fraud round table&quot; has been established and is making progress on the development of this procedure so it is clear what insurers should do where they believe the case is fraudulent, and what should be done in instances where the judge comments on fraud on conclusion of the case.  The overall aim is to ensure there is a visible deterrent to fraud and exaggeration taking place. <\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>We have heard time and again how frustrating the lack of co-operation or engagement between insurers and policyholders is with companies agreeing to settle without the involvement of the policyholders.  We must be mindful that under an insurance contract, the decision to settle or not is in the hands of the insurance company.  That is the essence of the contractual relationship between the insurer and policyholder.  However, both reports clearly recognise the impact it has on a business when there is no engagement on claims against the policy.  The motor report includes a recommendation in this regard and the report on employer liability and public liability insurance has a mirrored recommendation targeted at businesses.  It is imperative that we secure the co-operation of industry in this regard. <\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>On data transparency, substantial progress has been made to develop legislation to establish the national claims information database.  The aim of the database is to improve the availability of data in the insurance sector.  The working group believes that it is necessary to get the motor part of the database up and running first before considering its extension to the employer liability and public liability area as we need to get the foundations right.  Undertaking too much at once would be counterproductive.  <\/p><p><b><i><\/i><\/b>As stated, there is no quick solution to this issue.  The working group has substantially progressed work in many areas.  While we have a way to go yet, I wish to confirm the Government's commitment to tackling the cost of insurance.  I understand why many believe the pace of reform is not sufficiently quick.

If we were to ask people out and about whether they have seen any reasonable progress in this area, they would probably answer they have not.  They would tell us they still see premiums increasing.  Indeed, we had a men's shed group before the committee last week.  The representatives adverted to the potential threat to their existence in some areas where the number of members is small.  This arises because of several factors, including insurance.  I had raised the mart sector with the Minister of State on the floor of the D&aacute;il previously but when appearing before the committee, the representatives of the sector stated clearly that if they experience anything close to what they have experienced in the past three years, marts will close down with all the associated effects.  We heard from other community groups about how the cost of insurance is increasing and taking up a large proportion of core costs.<\/p> <p>  We know about all the reforms proposed.

My predecessor was working on it before me.  As I said in my opening statement, it is not about writing reports but the implementation of those reports.  Why are premiums not reducing?  As awards go up, so do premiums.  We have a high-award system in Ireland.  I may not be pleased with that and others may not be pleased with that.  Anyway, there is a line I use when I explain the insurance sector in Ireland.  If we have a high-awards sector, we will have a high-premiums sector as well.

We heard the most recent example from mart managers.  A case in point arose when an individual was bitten by a horse.  No one could make this up.  The mart does not own the horse.  An individual was bitten by the horse.  The insurance company settled because it was easier for the company to settle.  Who picked up the tab?  It was the mart that did not own the horse that bit an individual.  That is what is going on.  That is not about the cost of claims.

There was also the case of the award to the individual who dropped his trailer on himself in mart grounds and the award was made against the mart.  There is a reason there is settlement of these claims.  The primary reason is that the insurance companies make a calculation and decide it is cheaper to settle rather than go through the court process.  This keeps going back to one aspect that we cannot avoid.  As a person goes through the court process in Ireland, the awards are high.  A simple calculation is performed by insurance companies.  It is cheaper to settle, regardless of whether the claim is legitimate, than to go through the courts process.<\/p> <p>  The question of transparency arises.  We do not have sight of the information or all the data.  The area we have sight of covers the PIAB and the courts.  We do not have data on what is settled on the steps of the courts or on claims settled before they get to that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#M00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I will come to the issue of claims but I will make another comment before I move on from the marts issue.  The representatives before the committee last week referred to potential health and safety works that were required.  They were carried out in the past by certain marts but the premiums still increased.  Following the recent accident in one of the marts, there was a call for substantial work in several marts.  Those involved called for some type of grant aid to support the industry to reach new health and safety standards.  The hope is that there would be acceptance by the insurance industry that such a move would result in the premiums falling.  Is that something the Minister of State is open to discussing with mart operators?<\/p> <p>  That takes me on to questions on the claims database.  The Minister of State referred at the end of his contribution to a phased approach.  I got a nice letter from Insurance Ireland.  That body was giving out to me about what I had been saying about it and its objection to what is being proposed.  I said it was a sick joke, given that the commission is actually investigating Insurance Ireland for potential cartel-like activities involving deterring new entrants from the market.  Yet, in the Insurance Ireland submission to the Department's consultation exercise, the body suggested that the national claims information database would do exactly what Insurance Ireland is accused of doing, that is, it would prevent additional or new entrants to the market.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister of State have a view on curtailing the type of information that would be collected?  Does he have a view on the requirements on the Central Bank to report in the way suggested in the heads, that is, with regard to transparency and the links between premiums and insurance and so on?  That is something we know Insurance Ireland does not want the Department or the committee to do.  Is there any rowing back from the Government with regard to what is being proposed?

I will read the note because it is comprehensive and it is an important aspect of the work we are doing.  The development of a national claims information database is a complex project, as insurers often record data in different ways and we do not necessarily use the same definitions.  On 19 December 2017, the Government approved a general scheme for a national claims information database.  The Bill is included in the Government legislative programme under the list of priority legislation for publication in this session.<\/p> <p>  I note this committee indicated to the Minister for Finance in February that it would not conduct pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel signed a draft of the Bill on 26 January 2018.  Officials in the Department of Finance are currently working with the draftsman to finalise a draft of the Bill as soon as possible.  I understand that good progress has been made and I hope the Bill will be published before the end of this legislative session.  Consultation also must take place with the European Central Bank on the Bill once it is published.  It will take a certain amount of time following publication of the Bill for it to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, I am hopeful that with the co-operation of all parties in both Houses, it will be considered and approved quickly.<\/p> <p>  To ensure the database can be put into operation quickly following enactment of the legislation, the Central Bank has continued to work in parallel on the technical specification for a database.<\/p> <p>  We are going ahead with the legislation in line with the heads of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#M00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Insurance Ireland has particular objections to head 4 of the Bill which was the piece that provided for transparency.

The Department was looking to have legislation in place for a national claims information database by quarter 1 of this year and the national claims information database established by quarter 2 of this year.

Various solicitors involved in personal injuries tell me the value of claims being paid out to their clients is declining, whereas FBD informed the committee of a particular court case that has resulted in an increase in the value of claims.  The Minister of State probably knows more about that case than I do.  To be analytical, will the Minister of State address the national claims information database in terms of the metrics?

They are independent figures.<\/p> <p>  I have requested something that did not form part of the cost of insurance working group.  I have a small business and employ people and so I pay a number of insurance fees.  One of the things that I have asked, and it will happen soon, relates to the cost of insurance last year.  As a small employer and businessman I have 11 insurance policies for machinery, public liability and other types of insurance.  I want people to know what their figure was last year for comparison purposes.  I know many companies or people who wonder how much a certain type of insurance cost them last year.  They may have the details locked away in a filing cabinet but they may not have the time to search for them and get quotes.  For me, it is a small issue that can easily be resolved so that last year's price is listed on the same page as this year's price.  Having both prices enables one to see if the price has increased or decreased.  Obviously if the price has decreased then people will be pleased.  I have spoken to people who have multiple insurance cover and some of them do not know what they paid last year.  Have they time to get insurance quotes?  They probably do not.  <\/p> <p>  It would make a huge difference if people adhered to the book of quantum.  If they did it would not matter whether an individual settled directly with an insurance company without the assistance of legal advice.  It would mean that for every outlying award that is a multiple of or 50% more than the standard amount, under the Solvency II rules and the regulations, insurance companies are obliged to underwrite that amount.  That means if it is &euro;25,000 for a broken arm and suddenly there is a payout of &euro;45,000, the solvency rules will ensure that the insurance company is capable of making the payout.  Therefore, it is crucial that we get people to adhere to the book of quantum.  Whether the book of quantum is used by an individual to settle with an insurance company early or whether a case goes to the High Court, it will not matter as the case should fall within the numbers stated in the book of quantum.  Such a scenario would be greatly beneficial.  As we have seen with insurance companies, it is a business.  The business is not black and white but is a predictive business.  On the basis of the business being predictive, premiums have increased and reduced.  Therefore, it is incorrect for the Vice Chairman to claim that the cost of insurance has only increased.  The cost did go one way for a period but since July 2016, the cost of motor insurance has reduced by 20%.<\/p> <p>  We only published the report on employer and public liability insurance in January 2018 and we have concluded all eight of the first quarter recommendations within just four months.  Moreover, we will conclude 26 of the 29 recommendations in this calendar year.  As I have said about motor insurance, all of these actions will have a cumulative effect and there is no single bullet to remedy the situation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018052900002#Q02000","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1527606000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>How much fraud exists in the sector at present?

I would like to begin by referencing evidence provided by Ms Joan O'Donnell of the Disability Federation of Ireland to this committee in January 2018.  She informed members that, between 2013 and 2016, unemployment dropped by 5.3% but that the rate of employment among people with disabilities increased by just 0.4%.  Some 71% of adults of working age with a disability are not in work.  This is a stark figure.  More than two thirds of people with disabilities are unemployed.  I have a job.  I am part of the one third but it comes as no surprise to me that I am in a minority.  I have a good job that I enjoy very much but I did not land there overnight.  I would like to stress to members that so many others like me face the challenges that I have faced in looking for a job.<\/p> <p>  I have about two feet of clear vision and after that my world is blurry.  I struggle to recognise faces, cannot read message or notice boards and need assistance in the simplest activities of life that most people would take for granted such as cutting bread or anything involving hand to eye co-ordination.  When I started school in the 1990s, supports for someone with my limitations were few and far between.  In 2002, after repeated assessments and appeals to then Department of Education and Science, I was granted the use of a laptop and given some resource teaching.  As I am blind, I rely on sound, which is my primary way of learning.  I was unable to read and write properly until I was almost nine.  I was eventually granted a special needs assistant which enabled me to learn properly for the first time in my life.  However, when I finished primary school I lost all of these services, which do not follow the student into second level education.  At around the same time I was granted a medical card which was used to purchase low vision aids such as magnifiers, my white cane and monoculars which I use for notice boards.  This timing is really important, given that I was in third year before I was granted any educational supports in school so I would have relied heavily on these low-vision aids.<\/p><p>Once my supports were in place my school marks began to pick up.  According to my academic records, any time I was without supports my marks would drop, but as soon as they were reinstated my marks would improve again.  To me that is simple proof that when persons with a disability are offered the correct supports in education they are just as capable of doing well as their schoolmates.  I firmly believe that if my supports had been consistent throughout secondary school, I would not have failed examination after examination for two years.  I also believe that if I had access to a lifelong assistive technology programme, as suggested by the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, and Enable Ireland in their 2016 discussion document, my school days would have been as normal as those of my classmates, instead of the constant struggle they were.  <\/p><p> My special needs assistant, SNA, hours, were halved at the start of sixth year, which had a serious impact on my ability to revise and was horrendously stressful.  I was unable to keep up in classes and had to be home-schooled for the remainder of the year with grinds to get me through my leaving certificate.  Once I got to college I was thrilled to discover that things were much different.  The disability support service in University College Cork could not have been more supportive.  I was offered grinds and assistive technology and I had a note-taker.  I was allowed to learn at my own speed and my independence, particularly through assistive technology, was encouraged and hugely supported.  I completed my BSc in Public Health in 2014 and followed on with an MA in Government and Politics in 2016.  My master's thesis focused on the impact of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 on children with disabilities and the results are as I expected.  Children with disabilities are not being supported in the way the legislation intended because, for the most part, it has not been meaningfully implemented.  <\/p><p> After spending almost six years in college, I found myself struggling to find work, even with my qualifications.  As soon as prospective employers saw my cane, there was a pitiful look and I would receive the \"we regret to inform you\" letter a week later.  I have a drawer full of such letters at home.  To counteract the blank spaces that were quickly filling up on my curriculum vitae, I volunteered or interned in sectors in which I had an interest.  It was only last November when I attended an interview where my disability and my cane were not given a second glance by the interview panel.  I succeeded in getting a job as a constituency assistant to Liadh N&iacute; Riada, the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP for Ireland South.  I have all the supports I could ask for in this job.  I have a large monitor and a scanner and these supports provide me with the help I need to do the job to the best of my ability.  My contract has just been renewed so I must be doing something right.  This is surely anecdotal evidence that once a person with a disability is given the correct supports, he or she can work on a level playing field with colleagues.  <\/p><p> However, with the good news comes a setback.  When I was granted my medical card in the early 2000s I had more sight than what I have today.  I have lost some of my peripheral vision in the past few years.  I have had my medical card for almost 20 years.  It was granted to me on medical grounds.  However, when I notified the Health Service Executive that I had begun working my medical card was revoked.  There was no appeals process open to me.  If I want the medical card back I have to begin a new application process, which will take a number of months and will probably be refused again on financial grounds.  I am highly unlikely to get my medical card back if I continue to do the job I worked so hard to get.  This puts a financial strain on me which is not faced by people without disabilities.  The HSE seems to believe my blindness was cured overnight when I got my job.  It has not factored the cost of low-vision aids covered by my medical card into its online means test.  There is no set price for these aids.  Depending on the aid a person needs, the cost could be &euro;100, &euro;200 or &euro;2,000 and upwards.  <\/p><p> The current funding model for assistive technology in the workplace is also completely outdated.  The HSE did not factor in the number of doctor and hospital visits I have each year.  I had well over 30 such visits last year.  While my financial circumstances may change throughout my life, my rights to health care, as a person with a disability, should never change.  I am very happy the committee is investigating labour activation for people with disabilities because it is very much needed and welcomed.  However, I earnestly appeal to the committee to consider the importance of lifelong access to assistive technology and medical supports when it publishes its report.<\/p><p> Challenges are faced by people with disabilities as they try to find employment.  These challenges are not faced by people without a disability.  Under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, people like me have a fundamental human right to full and effective participation and inclusion in society.  However, that right is of little use unless the correct supports are in place along the way.  People like me need assistive technology.  We need consistent educational supports and accessible facilities to allow us to participate on a level playing-field with our peers.  Accessibility is not just for buildings.  It is for every aspect of our lives in society.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Jessica N&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527591600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Before I start I want to thank Senator Dolan, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Delaney and and Ms Doreen Magee for giving us the opportunity to address the committee today.  I think it is vitally important to get evidence and hear from people that are actually affected on a daily basis and hear about what we go through.<\/p> <p>  To give the committee a bit of background about me, I am 34 years old.  I have cerebral palsy which affects my motor control, so I require a motorised wheelchair to get around.  I also have a task dog named Gail, to retrieve dropped items, help me take my coat off and perform basic tasks.  Due to this, I no longer need as much help as I would.  This has been provided to me by Dogs for the Disabled.  I am a two-time Paralympian and a former world champion in the sport of boccia.  I have just completed my degree in communications at Dublin City University, and I also compete for that university in powerchair football at European level. <\/p> <p>  Growing up in Ireland with any type of impairment is hard, because it is always a battle to access service that one needs.  I have been very lucky in that both my Mum and Dad instilled a good work ethic in me and always told me not to accept the norm.  Growing up in Ireland, one wonders whether one will be lucky enough to gain employment.  The answer for me is \"yes\", despite the fact that the system does its best to keep a person like me claiming social welfare.  In 2006, I started working for East Coast FM in production.  The station gradually upskilled me to mixing and producing, before I moved into the role of sports reporter on a freelance basis.  The management and staff of East Coast FM have always challenged me to become the best that I can be.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, I secured a full-time job at Sky Ireland.  It is an outstanding employer with a world-class inclusivity policy, and any supports I have required have been put in place.  My colleagues are the best that anyone could wish for, and they really take excellent care of Gail and me.  I am now a service and loyalty specialist, having been promoted.  When I started working, I lost my disability and medical card after a few months, and my travel pass two years later.  The income disregard of &euro;120 has not been renewed since 2006.  That really needs to be looked at again.  The members of the committee also might want to factor in that the disability allowance payment is exactly the same as the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.  Unemployment is a temporary condition, while I think the committee will accept that cerebral palsy, autism and most other physical disabilities are permanent.  The State does not factor in the extra overheads that people with disabilities encounter every day.  There is also no consideration in the income tax system of the extra costs that a person with a disability has to face.  <\/p> <p>  I require a personal assistant to help me function, which I get for ten hours a week.  These ten hours were allocated to me in 2011, and that plan has never been renewed or updated, nor has anyone ever asked me if it has changed.  Last February, I was afforded the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on the difficulties that I was facing with Irish Rail.   After giving evidence to the committee, I was targeted because I dared to speak out to the media and expose the challenges that a person in a wheelchair faces on a daily basis.  As most of the members will know, Mr. Delaney is very good at what he does.  He agreed to advocate for me and help me to resolve those issues.  He attended a meeting with myself and the new CEO, Mr. Jim Meade.  Ciar&aacute;n dissected the evidence and presented my case, outlining what I was subjected to.  In fairness to Mr. Meade, he acted on that.  My fine was rescinded and I was offered lots of help.  In that regard, I would like to thank Irish Rail and the new chairman, Mr. Frank Allen.  Irish Rail is becoming a better company, trying to improve services for people in wheelchairs.  <\/p> <p>  Another part of my problem with the current system concerns my supports.<\/p><p>Twelve per cent of my monthly salary is spent on funding additional personal assistant hours because I cannot function on ten hours per week.  I have the long-term illness coverage because I have cerebral palsy.  I am also asthmatic but because asthma is not a cerebral palsy related condition my inhalers are no longer covered under this scheme.<\/p><p> In terms of education, I have been really lucky in terms of the supports provided to me by Dublin City University.  A friend of mine wants to pursue a course in a college of further education but she is being denied access because the college refuses to purchase a hoist or put in place supports to enable her to use the toilets.  Senator Dolan and Ciar&aacute;n Delaney have done a lot of work to improve access.  This is another barrier being put in the way of a person trying to access a fundamental service.  People with disabilities are often forgotten in the crossfire.  We are not seen as a large voting group because we cannot engage in mass protest and so it is slightly easier to make cuts to our services.  There are many advocacy groups and people on large salaries making decisions that affect us but up to now engagement with people with disabilities who face additional overheads in this regard has been rare.  It is important that meetings like this continue to happen.<\/p><p> A few months, I had to have my glasses upgraded.  When I applied for PRSI relief in an effort to recoup some of that cost I was told I was not entitled to it because I had not worked for five consecutive years.  There is supposed to be a five-year transition period for people who move from the disability allowance to employment but that transition period was never applied to me.  My allowance was taken from me straight away.  When I engaged with the then Department of Social Protection I was told by a member of staff that if I returned to part-time work I would get all of my benefits back.  This is a damning indictment of the system.  If the Government continues to decimate supports, people with disabilities will not move into employment.  There are plenty of people with disabilities who are able to work.  However, if in doing so their supports are withdrawn it will have a massive impact on their lives.  We are supposed to be afforded fundamental human rights.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, has been ratified but the protocol has not.  In Ireland, we do little bits but we do not do enough.  People with disabilities get a few crumbs every now and again to keep them happy.  We need more than token gestures, we need action.  I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for commencing the process of appointing people with disabilities to the boards of public transport bodies and to Sport Ireland to help improve fundamental services.  All Ministers and committees should follow this lead and actively engage, as we are today, with people with disabilities to ensure the system works more conducively for people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.

I propose to use this opportunity to speak from personal experience and also as a professional working in the area of education supporting people with disabilities to transition from further and higher education into employment.  I graduated from University College Dublin in 1994 with a social science degree, following which it took me about one year to enter employment.  I can categorically say that this was possible because I had a personal assistant throughout my education.  I was also fortunate enough to be able to use my personal assistant service to transition into employment.<\/p><p>The reason for that is I came into the system under the old conditions.  Therefore, I did not have to give up my personal assistant service after I graduated from college.  Nowadays, the system is very different.  The funding structures, etc., are different.  When a young person graduates from further or higher education, he or she no longer has an automatic entitlement to a personal assistant when he or she enters employment.  Obviously, not everyone requires this support.  It is required by many people with mobility issues and physical disabilities.<\/p><p> I would like to explain what personal assistants do for people in their workplaces.  My personal assistant assists me in doing my job.  I am employed by my employer.  I am the person with the qualifications to carry out my role.  My personal assistant follows my instructions and carries out tasks under my supervision that I am physically incapable of doing.  Everything comes back on me as my ultimate responsibility.  My personal assistant is not a burden on my employer.  I employ her.  It is really important for this to be clearly understood from an employer's perspective.  This service or entitlement is no longer provided to many young people, and indeed older people.  I categorically believe this is a fundamental barrier to employment.<\/p><p> In recent years, I have been working in the further education service with the Rehab group.  I provide a service to people who are transitioning from special education into the mainstream system.  Many of these people have been told from a very young age that they are failures and cannot and should not have expectations for themselves.  Their parents also hear this when their children are very young.  Part of my job is to challenge not only the internalised perceptions of these people, but also the perceptions of society at large.  It is worrying that numbers have been decreasing instead of increasing in recent years.<\/p><p> I thought about this aspect of the matter as I prepared to come to this morning's meeting.  In Ireland, we are very good at getting European funding and running very successful projects that enable people to try out things.  The outcomes can be very successful.  I was fortunate enough to be involved and employed in the career pathways project, which was initiated by Trinity College.  The purpose of the project was to support people with disabilities as they prepare to make the transition from study to employment.  The outcomes of this project, which enabled and supported people in getting jobs, were very positive.<\/p><p> During the course of this three-year project, I helped people with everything from CV preparation and interview skills to disclosure of disability.  How should someone who has a hidden disability disclose that to a prospective employer?  At what stage should this be done?  How can one become confident in articulating one's needs and selling one's qualities?  How can one demonstrate to oneself and others that one has a valuable contribution to make in the labour market?  Despite all the positive outcomes - this project has won two awards for the substantial impact it has made in people's lives - unfortunately it was decided to discontinue the project when the funding dried up.<\/p><p>Many people were left without a service, essentially.  People's lives are worth much more than that.  I am one of the lucky ones.  I should not feel lucky.  This should be an automatic human right for everyone.<\/p><p> The alarming lack of a comprehensive career guidance service in special schools has been highlighted in the media in recent weeks.  It is old news, but it really has to change.  It demonstrates the lack of value placed by the Government and by society at large on anyone who is different or does not fit the mould.  If there is one message I would like to get across to the committee today, it is that there needs to be more communication between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is only through constant communication, dialogue and negotiation that the issues which prevent people from accessing education and employment can be addressed.<\/p><p> As Ms N&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in and Mr. Moran have demonstrated, people with disabilities want to work.  From my perspective, it is very uncomfortable to be asked by parents, and others who see me performing in my job, to explain how I have succeeded.  When I share a certain amount with them, as appropriate, they ask me how they can get what I have.  In such circumstances, I have to tell them honestly that they do not have an automatic human right to that.  All I can do is give them some pointers and guidelines on how to advocate for themselves.  In my opinion, that is no longer acceptable in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Daly.

Nine years ago, I was drugged and violently assaulted.  I suffered multiple fractures of my skull and multiple brain injuries.  I am deaf in one ear and I have various other issues.  I am also invisible because I look normal, whatever that means.  I was working for a semi-State company.  I had been there ten years.  When I got out of hospital, I walked out the door with no support - no medical appointments, no support numbers, no occupational therapy, nothing.  I walked out the door 19 days after receiving a brain injury.  I had to get on with my life with no support from anybody.  The semi-State company for which I had worked for less than ten years was less than supportive.  It forced me to go back to work after three months.  It insisted that there was nothing wrong with me.  Indeed, my bosses said I was not deaf and suggested I was making it all up.<\/p> <p>  This is the unfortunate part of being invisible, or what I normally call \"hidden\".  I am high functioning.  Brain-injured people who look brain injured or disabled have a large advantage over me.  I would not call it a slight advantage.  The next three years were hell.  They gave me no support.  When I found DeafHear in North Frederick Street, I walked in the door and said that I was deaf in one ear and had suffered brain injuries.  I asked the people in DeafHear for help and they gave it to me.  I also found Headway Ireland, which has saved my life twice at this stage.<\/p><p>It is a great support group which has supported me to this day and, I suspect, it will probably do so for the rest of my life.  I had to knock on that group's door and say: \"Excuse me, can you help me?\" <\/p><p> I thought myself to walk again, as I am deaf in one ear and I tend to fall over.  I was falling over a lot.  I have some false teeth, and I am due to get some more, as I kept falling over.  I got no physiotherapy to help me with my vertigo and deafness.<\/p><p> Meanwhile the company I worked in was trying to sack me at every hand's turn.  Eventually, I could not take it any more and I went out on sick leave again.  I got a letter coming up to Christmas advising me I was being sacked because I had no underlying medical conditions.  I have that letter from the chief medical officer of a semi-State company at home.  The union backed me.  It had an extraordinary meeting with us and the chief medical officer, for the first time in the history of a semi-State organisation, changed his mind and gave me my superannuation over Christmas when the union was closed and I could not get any support.  <\/p><p> I was 48 years old and had been thrown on the scrap heap.  I applied for social welfare benefit and I was awarded an invalidity pension.  God help one if one is on an invalidity pension, as one cannot even volunteer to do anything, because if one does, one will lose benefits.  I tried to apply for a hearing aid.  I do not know if the members have noticed me turning around drastically to listen to the speakers to my left, which is my deaf side.  DeafHear helped me, which was great, but it could not supply me with a hearing aid because it is granted on basis of having of a medical card, not on the basis of pay related social insurance, PRSI.  That is another one of those invisible barriers or traps about which Senator Dolan spoke.<\/p><p> When I awarded an invalidity pension I applied for rent allowance and I was told I would get it.  That was grand.  I submitted the form and waited.  They said it would take a few months as there was a backlog, but nothing happened.  I rang the Department and was told it had moved offices and that there was a backlog so I waited.  I was still paying rent out my superannuation payment, which was rapidly decreasing.  That went on for nine or ten months.  I had to submit the form three times and on the third occasion, I was told I would not be granted rent allowance.  I had to pay my landlord over half of my welfare payments, bearing in mind my level of payment is on the poverty line.  That was the position I was in for another few months.<\/p><p> I was on the housing list.  I was told by the Department that if I was on the housing list, I would get rent allowance.  It was great to hear that, as I had been refused it previously.  I went into the office to apply for rent allowance and was awarded it, which was great.  Rent increased.  I was dutiful and submitted the form but I was cut off again.<\/p><p> I dealt with forms all my life, specifically during the past 13 years.  When one goes into a social protection office there is no communication and it as if it one should not talk.  I wanted to get medication because I have brain injuries and have issues sleeping.  They wanted to me give me benzodiazepines.  I wanted medication I could buy across the counter in Walmart in the US or in any chemist in Spain.  I tried to explain that but I was told that I was not 55 years of age and that I was not getting it.  I replied I was disabled, have brain injuries and could not take that medication, but they said it did not matter.<\/p><p> If the members look at this line of people, they will note we are all disabled.  However, we are all different.  We all need to be spoken to, not at.  Too many times we are spoken at.  I was very fortunate two years ago with the help of Headway to make contact with the Disability Federation of Ireland, which has been wonderful and has helped me to do these types of things.  I was involved in Headway's I See Beyond campaign and I did not realise at the time I was asked to be a part of that for my own benefit.  The idea is to see beyond the disability, to see the person.  I was fortunate enough to be in Brussels as a representative of Disability Federation of Ireland for the 4th EU Parliament of Persons with Disabilities.  I was involved also in the Make Way Day campaign, the aim of which is to get able bodied people to think about us for a change, to step out of their position and try to see matters from our side.<\/p><p> A person in a wheelchair was left on a roadside last week because able bodied people would not get out of the way.  We face that every day.  When we deal with Departments it the same, if not worst.  I am not the same as Jessica or Eileen but all Departments treat us the same way.  We are not the same; we are all different.  They do not talk to us.  I cannot work as I am not allowed to work.  However, I have a radio show every Thursday.  It is Viva Vox Dublin City FM 103.2, a disability show with a difference.  I can work and I know I can but I am not allowed to do so.  My former employer threw me on the scrap heap and the Government seems to want to box me into a little corner until I reach the age of 66 and then, from its viewpoint, I stop being disabled.  At the age of 66 we stop being disabled and just become old.  That is the reason for the 13.5 %.<\/p><p>Do members know what it feels like to be constantly pushed to the edge?  Perhaps they did not but maybe they do now.  I thank them for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Kearney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kearney for his presentation.

It was not good for me because I did not even learn to read or write.  I was not told anything about work or anything else when I was at school.  I was sent to a nursing home to work.  The work was okay but I was not properly paid for it and I got very little time off.  I was not happy there.  A social worker arranged for me to be moved me to a service.  It was a big hospital and I lived on a ward there.  After living on that ward for a few years, I moved into one of the bungalows on the complex and from there I moved into a residential house on Aylmer Road in Newcastle, County Dublin.  Nine of us lived there, four boys and five girls.  I later moved from there into independent living.  When I was moved into that hospital the social worker told me I would be there for only six months but that ended up being 32.5 years.<\/p> <p>  While I was in that service, I had to work in a big workshop packing boxes and then in a newsagent's shop owned by the service.  We did not get paid properly for that work.  I was first paid the equivalent of 50p a week, then &pound;5 a week and then &pound;10 a week.  It was hard work for very little money.  When I worked in those workshops packing bottles, then packing boxes and making box dividers for a Smurfit company, I stopped going back to work after at 3.30 p.m. break because I was not being paid properly and it was slave labour.  I called them sweatshops, not workshops.  That was the name I gave them many years ago.<\/p> <p>  I was lucky and got a job with Inclusion Ireland.  When I worked in those workshops, I also worked part-time once a week in the Shadowbox Theatre Company in Bray, for which I was paid by F&Aacute;S.  When I went to work with Inclusion Ireland, I realised that I could not really do anything.  It was a real job and I am now properly paid for working 20 hours a week.  It is the first real job I have had in my life.  I have been working with Inclusion Ireland for 13 years.  It is one of the best jobs I have had.  I applied for other jobs and submitted my curriculum vitae but I was discriminated against because none of those employers got back to me.<\/p> <p>  I got to work for Inclusion Ireland because I knew a lady called Lisa who was working there and I used to attend its meetings.  They told there was some work going and that I would be able to do it.  After that, the people involved in the 360 initiative came out to the hospital and interviewed me.  Lisa helped me with the interview, but I could not see her because she was in the background.<\/p><p>I got the message through my television, speaking for people's rights to have a proper job and proper wages.<\/p><p> I cannot work more than that or I will lose all my benefits.  I would be afraid to lose my bus pass.  It would cost about &euro;15 return from Navan to Dublin for each day if I had no bus pass.  If I had to pay that all my money would be gone, because I am only working part-time.  Then I would not be able to pay my bills and my mortgage.  <\/p><p> I would not be much better off in full-time work if I lost my travel pass and my medical card.  I lost my medical card once when I was in these services.  The social welfare management came to me and to my key worker and told me that I was not entitled to one.  They took my medical card and they wanted the bus pass but I would not give it to them because I had to travel to work every day and I travel around the country a lot.  They said I had too much money in the bank.  They wanted bank statements and everything.  It cost me more than &euro;600 to get bank statements from the first day I opened a bank account.  They were not happy with them, so they asked me to send them in again.  It cost me another &euro;600 to send them again.  They would not do anything for me, so I contacted my TD, who at that time was Deputy Joanna Tuffy, who was based in Lucan.  She helped me to get it back.  Then they took it off me again, saying I had too much money in the bank.  The reason I had too much money in the bank was that the service used to take money from our disability allowance every week.  They used to give us &euro;10 a week and then later it went up to &euro;20.  The most we ever got out of that was &euro;30 a week.  When Mary Harney was in the Minister for Health and Children in 2005, she said that people in these services, in nursing homes and independent living, would have to be given back the money that had been taken from them.  The amount depended on how long someone was in the services.  We got a small sum in 2005 and it took three years for an organisation in Tralee to sort out the money.  People received sums ranging from &euro;20,000 up to &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  I kept that money.<\/p><p> Later on, I went to a meeting with my boss, Mr. Paddy Connolly, the CEO of Inclusion Ireland.  I heard about an organisation called Possibilities Plus.  That is a group that helps people to move out of services, independent living and nursing homes and live a life of their own.  We started having meetings with the service and the HSE.  It took three years for me to access that funding from the HSE and the services and to find a place to live.  The anti-bullying group is in DCU.  I am a part of that group.  That group and Inclusion Ireland helped me to get my own place.  <\/p><p> When I started at Inclusion Ireland I used to get everything wrong because of my reading.  They organised for me to attend reading and writing class with the national learning centre in Mountjoy.<\/p><p>I asked them to see if they could get a course for me because I was doing everything wrong.  I was putting letters in the wrong envelopes and putting the wrong addresses on envelopes.  They were all coming back.  Inclusion Ireland was losing a lot of money in stamps, so the management got me a place on this course.  This course went on for about seven years, but they told me at the beginning it was only going to be a two-year course.  I used to go in every Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. before I went into work.  I had homework, which I did for two hours after work on Thursday nights before I went in on Friday.  When I did that, it refreshed my mind for the work I was doing in the college with a one-to-one teacher.<\/p><p> It was great.  I can read and write now and I have also learned to use computers.  My second chance at education really helped me in my job.  It helped me to get where I am now.  I could not read, write, use computers or anything, even photocopying.  Now I can do it all with the support of Inclusion Ireland.  I take part in advocacy groups about rights and independent living and I am involved in focus groups.  I have been working with them for 13 years.  I think the staff are A1.<\/p><p> I was still unhappy living in the service.  I had moved to a group home, but had no choice in who I lived with.  I could not choose my support worker.  I was not at the interviews to choose who I wanted to work with me.  People were just thrown onto a case.  The service would simply say that a certain person was my key worker.  That is wrong.  People with disabilities should have the right to be at those interviews and choose who they want to support them in living a good life.  I wanted to move out.  I started to fight to get a personal budget.  The service agreed to give me enough money to get eight hours of support.  The budget took three years, and it took three years to find a place with the help of Inclusion Ireland, the anti-bullying group, and Possibilities Plus.  <\/p><p> My new support service is Possibilities Plus.  That organisation has my budget and pays a person to work for me for eight hours a week.  He has to do eight hours a week, or 32 hours a month.  I was the one who interviewed him, and for the first time in my life I chose the support worker I wanted.  It was a big change for me when I moved out.  I could not leave the house for the first six weeks, because I was used to support around me the whole time.  Now I get out of the house.  My support worker helps me to do that.  He gets me out doing activities, and he helps me make friends.  He helps me with what I cannot do, but I tell him what I want done.  It is not about what he wants done, because I am his boss.  I am the one who employed him.  The HSE gives him some of my budget, paid via Possibilities Plus.  If he does not do that eight hours a week, we can bank them for something else later on.  I said to him when I first moved out that I needed a bit of support when I went to certain places.  Now, I can do it all on my own.<\/p><p>I bought my own apartment in Navan and it is great.  I picked the paint, the bed clothes, the floors and all the electrical stuff myself.  I never did that before.  I got a loan from the credit union in Rathcoole.  I repay it out of my payment from Inclusion Ireland at the end of every month.  The money goes to the credit union on the first of every month because I do not get paid until the end of the month.  I have a new life living on my own because I never lived at home with my family.  I was always away from home.  I lived in services, in boarding schools, and did not get a proper education until I came to Inclusion Ireland.  Fair play to it for organising all this for me and for supporting me over the last 13 years in which I have been working with it.<\/p><p> Brian is my support worker.  I interviewed him and chose him with Dr. Bob McCormack from Possibilities Plus.  I went to a meeting with Mr. Paddy Connolly in Leopardstown and I heard about Possibilities Plus.  I told the people there that my family and the staff did not want me to move out of the services and that they would not let me move out.  I said that I should get what I want in life and that it is not what they want.  I kept fighting for it but it took three years of meetings with the family, with Inclusion Ireland, with the organisation and the HSE.  Someone said this person has plenty of money and he should be able to go out and buy his own place.  I just said to myself that I would think about it.<\/p><p> I thought hard about what to do with the money from the Government in 2008.  I put it into my own bank.  I told the staff I was not putting it into Bank of Ireland in Rathcoole because everyone else was.  It was my own choice to do that.  I brought the cheque in and lodged it myself.  I did that for the first time in my life.  After that, they did not have a leg to stand on because I was able to open an account myself.<\/p><p> Brian helped me to get linked in with lots of things and services in Navan.  I go to bingo on Tuesday nights and for the first couple of months, he used to come with me to support me.  I said to him that I did not want him to do that anymore and that we could bank those hours for something else.  He stopped coming with me and now I go on my own.  People keep a seat for me every week.  I got to know people from going to bingo.  That did not happen when I was in the services because I never got that chance.  I go to a trad music session twice a week.  I go the Central Bar and I go to The Lantern in Navan on Wednesday nights.  I meet people in the pub and I got to know the people who play the music there.  It is the same in the Central Bar where I got to make new friends there.  I never got a chance to do anything like that when I was the services.<\/p><p>I go to the Special Olympics through the Arch club in Navan which is for people with a disability.  They play games for two hours every Thursday night and the club picks people to go to the Special Olympics.  The first year I went, the people at the club said I was good at table tennis and put me through to the Special Olympics for the first time.  That was the first time in my life I had ever engaged in activities.  I went to the Special Olympics and made the table tennis final.  I came second.  A year later I got a card that stated I would be part of the Special Olympics for the following five years.  <\/p><p> I do all of my own shopping and cooking.  Brian might have to come with me sometimes to help if I am going to buy clothes or anything like that because I do not know how to match clothes.  He also taught me how to cook.  I have friends in Beaufort in Navan who I go to on Mondays for a bit of lunch.  They support me and also taught me how to cook, but I can do it all of it on my own now.  If Brian is working with me at night time, I normally have dinner ready for him when he comes and if he is working with me in day time, I have breakfast ready.  This only came about because I met Dr. Bob McCormack one day.  I was lucky, but many people with disabilities are not so lucky.  They have not moved out of the services.  Years ago the Government stated people in the services should be moved out to live independently and choose their own support services.  I do not know when that is going to happen.  I was one of the lucky ones because I had to fight all my life for everything I wanted.  A personal budget helps me to live a life of my own.  It is great having my own budget and to be able to look after it myself, with Possibilities Plus, the HSE and Brian working with me.  From the budget, Brian gets something like &euro;50 which we can use to go out for a cup of coffee or a scone.  We cannot go for a meal or anything like it because there is a limit to the money available and I cannot go over budget or the hours allocated.  If I did, Possibilities Plus would have to pay extra, but it does not have the money to do so.  It is also great to be able to hang on to my own budget through my organisation.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening to me and having me here.  I hope everything goes well for everyone here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Alford","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Alford.

I am now going to make Ms Dina McAnaspie's contribution on her behalf.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>I attend a day service three days per week and work part-time two days per week.  I work in a bar on two-hour shifts, that is, four hours per week.  I really enjoy working and my goal is to work in a full-time job in retail in the future.  However, I have come across many things that have made getting a job very difficult for me.  When I was younger, I attended a special school.  There was no career guidance in my special school, so I did not get the same advice and help that other students get in mainstream schools across the country.  As well as this, there was no option to go into transition year in my school.  This means that I did not get the chance to get work experience in transition year the way that students in mainstream schools do.  When I was in school, I did get to have some work experience working in a charity shop.  This was a really great experience and it gave me a taste of what having a job was like.  I also got to experience what it is like to have a job.  I believe there should be more work experience opportunities available for people with intellectual disabilities.<br \/><br \/>When I left school I attended a day service.  I really enjoy attending my day service but at some point I want to be able to move on and get a full-time job.  I want to work just like everyone else.  At the moment, the staff members and my key workers help me with applying for jobs.  They help me put together my CVs and send them to workplaces.  It can be very hard to get a job, however, and it is also very hard to get the work experience one needs to get a job.<br \/><br \/>One of the problems that many people with intellectual disabilities come up against is that if we get a full-time job and leave the day service, there is no guarantee that those services will hold our places.  If things do not work out in a job, some people are left with nothing afterwards.  I feel that people with disabilities should be supported to get a job.  They should be supported during the job, if needed, and also supported if things do not work out.  At the moment, the system puts people off trying to get employment in case they lose their supports and services.  I thank the committee members for their time.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ailish Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McAnaspie and Ms Ryan.

We may need to bring in employers to talk to them about the barriers they may face in order that we can try to get over some of them.  While talking to prospective employees, we also need to consider perceived challenges or barriers.  Much of the time, they are perceived.  There may also be nervousness.  There is considerable work to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms N&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in for telling us her story.  The statistic she mentioned - 71% of adults without a disability - is very stark.  She argued for lifelong access to technology.  That is really important.  She lost her medical card and is saying some of the aids she needs vary in cost.  Will she indicate what the cost to her has been since she took up her job up in November?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Moran for his story.  Fair play to him for fighting for access to rail services.  It is really important.  I live in Newbridge.  There is a lift there, but one has to give 24 hours' notice to use it, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Since it is in place, it should be serviced all the time.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran referred to 12% of his salary going on additional PA hours.  The difference between Mr. Moran and Ms Daly is that Ms Daly was in the system before.  It has made a difference to her life, but Mr. Moran has to pay extra to try to live a normal life.<\/p><p>That is really important to note.<\/p><p> For Ms Daly to have the system she has is really important, as is the fact that her circumstances can be compared with those of someone who does not have it.  There could have been a fundamental barrier to employment for Ms Daly.  Therefore, we need to examine the aids and supports.  This is why I believe we need to bring in prospective employers to talk about these issues.  Ms Daly is absolutely right that we need constant dialogue and negotiation.<\/p><p> To Mr. Kearney, I say that I sometimes believe having an acquired brain injury is nearly the most difficult place for anybody with a disability.  It can be quite difficult to access supports.  There is a really grey area.  So much needs to be done in this regard.  That one cannot volunteer with an invalidity pension is an issue.  There is so much one could do as a volunteer for so many organisations.  It is wrong that we cannot get volunteers.<\/p><p> Mr. Alford addressed the area of exploitation really well and said some people in a vulnerable position can be exploited.  He has certainly fought the good fight in terms of getting the services he needed.  He should have and could have been able to learn to read and write when he was very young.  It is so sad that he did not get the chance to do that at that point.  Life could have been quite different at that stage.  I refer to having adequate literacy and numeracy.  When my brother went to a special school, my mother was told that he would not be able to read or write.  She said he will read and write.  He is one of 11.  I am the eldest of 11 children.  By the time my brother was five, he was reading and writing.  Every day, his encyclopaedic knowledge of everything amazes me.  He is always reading and writing.  It is so wrong that Mr. Alford was in the position he was in.  He has really fought back.  The next time he comes here, I hope he brings lunch for all of us.  He is a very good chef.<\/p><p> I thank Ms McAnaspie.  She touched on the area of transition year, not having the possibility to do work experience and the fact that there is no career guidance.  I intend to raise this at a meeting of the education committee.  Mr. Moran mentioned his colleague with the hoist.  This was mentioned to me.  I am happy to raise any such specific issues with the education committee with a view to trying to help.  I thank all the delegates so much.  I look forward to working together with John, Michael and Senator Dolan to determine how we can help in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#P00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>For the witnesses, the gentleman who has arrived and whom I said would be a bit late is Deputy Michael Harty, the Chairman of the heath committee.

I am sorry to have missed the personal testimonies.  I was in the audiovisual room a number of months ago when Senator Dolan brought in witnesses to give their life histories and to outline how their disabilities affect them.  I do understand the position but, unfortunately, I did miss the delegates' contributions this morning.<\/p> <p>  From a medical perspective, I believe in the importance of work to health.  Work is like a drug.  If people who have a disability can get a job, it lifts their personal status and self-esteem, and it also benefits them in so many other ways.  Work is like a drug in that it can benefit people greatly.  At meetings of the health committee, we have seen that health is one aspect of disability but there are many others.  There are many social determinants of health, including education, about which we have been speaking this morning, and housing, transport and social protection.<\/p><p>These all tie in with providing an enhanced quality of life to people with disabilities.  In rural Ireland, the lack of transport is a huge inhibiting factor for people in terms of getting employment and access to work.<\/p><p> Personal budgets should be introduced in the near future because they give people with disabilities a totally different aspect to their independence, meaning that they can decide how to live and how their supports are used to their advantage, because each person is different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#Q00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Some of them are not strangers to us but it is probably the first time others have appeared before any committee, which, I know, is a daunting task at the best of times.  We are here to help and to put a pathway in place to assist the witnesses and the people they have quite ably represented this morning.<\/p> <p>  Is Brian here with Mr. Alford today?  Mr. Alford mentioned him quite regularly in his contribution.  I do not know who is the more tolerant of the two.<\/p> <p>  I have read the submission from the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, which touched on all of the statistics and figures in terms of unemployment levels.  That is all fine.  However, to hear at first hand about the barriers in respect of getting into work and sustaining employment that are put in place by the State is critical.  Some announcements have been made in the past year concerning medical cards and the travel pass.  Last year, the Taoiseach announced that anyone in receipt of a long-term disability payment who gained employment could retain those benefits for five years.  I am not sure of the views of the witnesses on that matter, but I do not believe five years is long enough.  It is a serious issue which many people with disabilities face.  Mr. Moran is from Bray, my home town, and I know him.  He has had many battles with our public transport system, including, as one of my colleagues mentioned, having to give notice 24 hours in advance when travelling on public transport.  Even with that, there are huge failures within the system.  Having a free travel pass is one thing, but having a public transport system that actually works is another.  Many people have to rely on taxis.  Mr. Moran mentioned in a conversation before the meeting that he might pay up to &euro;500 a month for taxis because of the failures of the public transport system.  If anyone else has issues such as that, it would be very useful to know about them.<\/p> <p>  Another announcement was made about the earnings disregard relating to the medical card.  A couple of contributors have spoken about the fear of losing the medical cards.  A colleague and friend of mine, Mr. John Doyle, who has unfortunately passed away, always said that when people with disabilities get jobs, their disabilities seem to be cured overnight and they lose their medical cards straight away.  One of our guests mentioned this and stated that his problems were cured because he got a job, which is absolutely crazy.  John Doyle, who was confined to a wheelchair, detailed the additional expenses that come with being disabled.<\/p><p>He spoke about the price of the cushion on his wheelchair and how much it cost to replace it.  The medical card was a cushion to fall back on which sustained him when he was unemployed.  That was a barrier that stopped him.  He became very friendly with Senator Dolan, the DFI and some other fantastic organisations.<\/p><p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has made some announcements in respect of the earnings disregard.  We have not seen the proposals as yet; perhaps the witnesses could share their views on them.<\/p><p> Ms McAnaspie spoke about entering the workforce without training or experience.  I am not sure what part of the country she is from, but I have some experience of dealing with WALK, which is a fantastic organisation working in the Louth area which works with people with disabilities and employers.  It helps to place people in employment and works alongside them.  It is a fantastic model that could be replicated across the State quite easily.  It works for both the individual and the employer.  I am not sure if any of the witnesses have any experience of that organisation.<\/p><p> In 1995, the Barcelona Declaration was made and the Government signed up to it.  The declaration set targets in many different areas, one of which was employment.  It aimed for 3% compliance quota to try to get people with disabilities into State jobs, whether with local authorities or Departments.  With the recruitment embargo in place, I am not sure whether that target was achieved.  However, since bodies - whether local authorities or across the board - have started hiring again, I know that people with disabilities have been completely overlooked.  The State is the largest employer in the country and it could easily achieve the targets that were set.  There are many brilliant people, including the witnesses, who are living with disabilities and who want to get into the workforce.  The State should not only achieve those targets, it should exceed them.<\/p><p> Ms N&iacute; Mhaolain brought up a serious point.  She mentioned that her supports were halved when she was in sixth year.  That was a critical time in her education and she described the impact the withdrawal of her supports had.  Unfortunately, we are aware of the delays that children face for accessing occupational therapy services.  Ms N&iacute; Mhaolain touched on the critical importance of having those services in place and the interventions that have to happen at an early stage.  Her comments on that certainly hit the mark and highlighted a serious issue that applies across the board.  Having the appropriate level of services cut by 50% at that stage had a real detrimental impact on her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#R00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I commend the Co-Chairman on getting the three committees together.

They have all done well.<\/p> <p>  I am the disability spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il and, as such, I deal with people with disabilities on a regular basis.<\/p><p>Fear of the loss of a medical card is the issue raised most regularly with me when I talk to persons with disabilities and their families.  It reminds me of a bird whose wings are caught.  People with huge potential are afraid to seek promotion at work or to get a good degree or complete a course that would lead to a good job because of the constant fear of losing a medical card.  I have raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in both the D&aacute;il and at the health committee and he has said he is aware of the issue and will look at it.  We must watch that going forward.<\/p><p> I note what Ms Daly said about the PA being employed by her rather than by her employer.  It is a very good point.  It is something employers fear in that it is not clarified.  As Deputy O'Loughlin said, it would be a good idea to bring employers to the joint committee to clarify the things they are unsure about.

It is something I am interested in discussing further with the witnesses.  How can we go forward in that regard?  Mr. Alford referred to the importance of involving persons with disabilities in the selection of their key workers.  I agree fully on that.  If one is going to be spending so much time with someone, one must ensure that one gets on with that person.  Brian is very lucky if Mr. Alford has his dinner ready some days.

I will not repeat a lot of what has been said and will, instead, ask a few particular questions which have arisen for me.  Mr. Moran mentioned not being seen as a voter base and being unable to organise quickly enough to protest or respond immediately when things happen.  Last week, I was surprised to hear at Viviane Rath's session in UCD on political representation that there is a stipulation that PAs cannot attend any sort of political engagement.  As such, PAs cannot go to political events with the person they assist.  Can someone comment on that?  If someone's PA cannot accompany him or her to political events, it dilutes that person's ability to function as an active citizen, to exercise representation or to seek to vindicate his or her rights.  It is an important issue and it should be examined.<\/p> <p>  I know Ms Daly from the amazing work she has done in Trinity College and from my involvement in the career service there.  She spoke about the three-year work project in Trinity.  Can she touch on some of the positive outcomes of that work?  She stated that people's lives cannot depend on project funding.  That is important.  These projects cannot be short term in nature when disability is a long-term matter for many.  My own daughter is on the spectrum and went into Trinity this year where she really saw the benefits of the disability service in the college.  I compare that to what people are saying around further education and the disparity between the further education sector and the universities in the context of disability services.  Can Ms Daly refer in greater detail to the beneficial outcomes of her work?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Alford referred to the residential spaces he has been in and how horrible that time was for him in not being able to live independently.  Can he clarify his references to workhouses?  Did residential services send him to work in these places for little to no pay?  How did that relationship come about and how did he end up in such employment?  Was he directed there from a particular service or did it happen because he was living in a residential service setting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#T00600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>The presentations have been really wonderful and lots of issues have been raised.  I will try to avoid some of the ones which have already been touched on, including the important point around the role of the embargo on public service recruitment.  I was struck by the issue of invisibility which Mr. Kearney spoke about.  He referred to invisible disability.  I was also struck by that issue in the context of what Mr. Alford said about residential institutions.  He said that when he was in residential care, he was unable to participate in his community and was not given the necessary level of visibility.  He has described how he now has that.<\/p> <p>  I was also struck in particular by how that is reflected in payments and the invalidity pension.  I also sit on the social protection committee and I am very interested in why a person would be on that payment rather than on disability allowance, which would permit some capacity to work.  It is a real worry that they are waiting for a person to become 66 when the disability will disappear.  It seems that those who are working or who are not on disability allowance see their disability or needs disappear because they are no longer on that payment.  It is a real concern given that there are people with disabilities who are working, who are older and who are younger.  They are in all those other parts of the system.  As such, the idea that a person comes into focus every now and again is a real concern.  The witnesses might comment on that.  I was struck by the idea that the pension penalises involvement, be it in politics or volunteerism.<\/p> <p>  Ms McAnaspie spoke about this also.  One wants a system that encourages one and good points were made on work experience, transition year and career guidance.  A narrative is coming across all the time that supports are in tension with work and engagement, which should not be the case.  We have a constant concern around loss of supports in relation to employment versus the narrative we need around supports which assist engagement.  Ms N&iacute; Mhaolain spoke very well about the idea of assistive supports.  Does any witness want to comment on how to reframe the dialogue around supports?<\/p> <p>  I was struck also by the amount of unpaid time required to negotiate bureaucracy and the gaps that opens up in one's career path or personal progression.  It is a huge amount of time.  Mr. Moran and Mr. Alford referred in particular to the huge amount of time that has had to be put in on advocacy to improve our services.  What Mr. Moran said about it being important that it be there at the beginning was striking.  We must have representatives in all of these institutions and committees at board level so that it does not fall to individual advocates.  Nonetheless, the witnesses might want to speak further to the optional protocol which is a way for individual advocates to press for improvements and demand justice from our systems.  That said, it should not fall to individuals to take those cases.<\/p> <p>  I have specific points for Ms Daly.  She spoke about transition points.  This is what we are really trying to tackle here.  The points on post-education supports were striking.  These are supports post-education around a person's next step.  She also mentioned further education.  Something that is a real concern for us on the social protection committee is the need to ensure that people are given further education options.  People in the social welfare system may not be coming straight out of secondary school and into college.  How do we ensure that further education is brought in and that people in their 30s and 40s are brought back into the education system?  What has been Ms Daly's experience?<\/p><p>Mr. Alford spoke about the importance of choice very eloquently; the choice of who one lives and works with, who supports one.  The personal budget is a key part of that.<\/p><p> I was also struck by what he said about having a reserve of funds because he had been wrongly exploited in the past, which allowed him make long-term plans.  Could people touch on the issue of how it can be difficult for persons on disability allowance to make the big leaps or the investment in a substantial change in their life?  The personalised budget is a weekly payment but how can we support moments of big change and give people the capacity to plan their own futures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#U00100","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank my Oireachtas colleagues for their strong support for and engagement with today's meeting.  Several organisations, Inclusion Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland, Headway, DeafHear and others were mentioned.  I will make observations rather than ask questions because we have a problem today: we will not be able to take the flesh off the bones of the important questions that people ask and that need further interrogation.<\/p> <p>  Several people spoke of getting a break or being lucky.  Mr. Moran said East Coast FM gave him a break, Jessica said Liadh N&iacute; Riada gave her a break, Mr. Alford said Inclusion Ireland gave him a break.  People talk about feeling lucky.  It is luck not systems.  As members of the committee we are dealing with three systems which are part of our public system but they are not working for the witnesses.  I was also struck that while they spoke about themselves they could not resist speaking about other people with disabilities.  Mr. Moran spoke about his friend trying to get into further education, Senator Ruane has referred to that.  There is a bank of supports at third level and it is untamed world when it comes to further education.  Colleagues have picked up on that today.  <\/p> <p>  Two points struck me today, one is this new way of listening to people.  In absolute nasty contrast, people with disabilities have been protesting inside the Polish Parliament since 18 April and their Government is treating them horrendously.  We have things to put right in this country but people with disabilities are in here as citizens - let us see more of them in here at this and other committees.  The people in Poland are looking for a decent few bob to get from week to week.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Loughlin said she has fought the good fight and now it is for Ireland to ratify the convention and fight the good fight.  These three committees are starting to consider the gaps that exist.  <\/p> <p>  The budget is coming up.  What are the interlocking things that could happen between these three Departments?  That needs to be addressed in the report.  The report also has to validate the exercise we have carried out here and make sure it is possible for more of this to happen.  <\/p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses.

We have not received a response to date and eagerly await that.  Five years is not long enough to retain the medical card based on disability, which is a lifelong issue.

One way to deal with that would be to have a medical card based only on the disability and its particular needs but open to the fact that people change too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527591600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I will respond to the points that were raised with me and promise that I will do so really quickly.  Deputy O'Loughlin asked me what I am paying out since I lost the medical card.  I did a quick calculation and I am probably handing out between 10% and 15% of my monthly income, at least.  That is not a cost that someone without a disability has.  It is purely linked to my disability.  There might be other costs that I have not factored in but those are directly related to it.<\/p> <p>  What Deputy Brady said about barriers to employment put up by the system is very true but there is also an attitudinal barrier among some employers.  I am not sure whether it is the place of the State to do so but someone needs to address that.  When people see a person with a cane or crutches, they presume that they might not be up to much.  The attitude does exist although it is definitely waning.<\/p> <p>  I failed to mention that when my supports were halved and I was home-schooled, my parents paid for grinds.  That cost was imposed on my family because of my disability and for no other reason.  I did not have a special needs assistant for one of my subjects and I had to do that subject exclusively at home with two sets of two-hour grinds per week, which was quite expensive.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony mentioned the fear of losing supports.  I am not sure about the other people here but I was well aware that I would lose supports by going for and getting this job.  I had reached the point in my life that I was so disheartened from constantly applying and having to put the confidence on when I knew people were not interested once they saw the cane that I did not care about losing supports.  In hindsight, that was very naive because I feel it now, especially in my pocket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052900002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jessica N&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527591600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I want to respond to Deputy Brady.

It will probably bring out pictures and everything else on how great it is but I merely ticked a box.  That is all I was.  The company did not actually do anything for the people with disabilities who worked for it.  If, like me, you were invisible, it did not want to know.  A lot of the semi-States and, I am sure, State bodies are just as guilty of it.  They will do the picture work to show they have the 3%, but there is nothing real behind it on the ground.

Only 650,000 people in Ireland are registered as having disabilities.  As such, we do not have the numbers where we can go out and make a difference.  When I was in London in 2012, four people were in Leinster House because there was a danger of the disability allowance and services being changed while we were competing over there.  Bringing in the optional protocol would provide people with disabilities with a greater input into society.  In my experience working in media, not only am I qualified to do it, but I must prove physically that I can do a piece to camera or record a live piece for radio.  It is not a question of being qualified, the question is asked whether if one is disabled one can do it.  There is a constant battle because there is still a very bad stigma.<\/p> <p>  I have been very lucky to have been able to compete in so many countries around the world through my sport because I have seen what can be achieved.  Brussels is pretty good, as is most of Europe.  Some places are not so good and I know that we are trying to get there.  Ultimately, if we do not act on what we are discussing today, we will end up going around the houses again and again.  It is very important to ensure that services are not whipped away from people like me.  I have to pay &euro;100 per month with the annual tax-saver ticket, which takes away eight hours of PA services that I could do with.  It is great that we are having meetings, but we need people to act on this.  We need people with disabilities to feel that they are valued as Irish citizens in society.  There is no point in doing this, saying the presentations were great and noting how striking it is that certain things have been lost if none of it is acted on.

I would like to begin by referencing evidence provided by Ms Joan O'Donnell of the Disability Federation of Ireland to this committee in January 2018.  She informed members that, between 2013 and 2016, unemployment dropped by 5.3% but that the rate of employment among people with disabilities increased by just 0.4%.  Some 71% of adults of working age with a disability are not in work.  This is a stark figure.  More than two thirds of people with disabilities are unemployed.  I have a job.  I am part of the one third but it comes as no surprise to me that I am in a minority.  I have a good job that I enjoy very much but I did not land there overnight.  I would like to stress to members that so many others like me face the challenges that I have faced in looking for a job.<\/p> <p>  I have about two feet of clear vision and after that my world is blurry.  I struggle to recognise faces, cannot read message or notice boards and need assistance in the simplest activities of life that most people would take for granted such as cutting bread or anything involving hand to eye co-ordination.  When I started school in the 1990s, supports for someone with my limitations were few and far between.  In 2002, after repeated assessments and appeals to then Department of Education and Science, I was granted the use of a laptop and given some resource teaching.  As I am blind, I rely on sound, which is my primary way of learning.  I was unable to read and write properly until I was almost nine.  I was eventually granted a special needs assistant which enabled me to learn properly for the first time in my life.  However, when I finished primary school I lost all of these services, which do not follow the student into second level education.  At around the same time I was granted a medical card which was used to purchase low vision aids such as magnifiers, my white cane and monoculars which I use for notice boards.  This timing is really important, given that I was in third year before I was granted any educational supports in school so I would have relied heavily on these low-vision aids.<\/p><p>Once my supports were in place my school marks began to pick up.  According to my academic records, any time I was without supports my marks would drop, but as soon as they were reinstated my marks would improve again.  To me that is simple proof that when persons with a disability are offered the correct supports in education they are just as capable of doing well as their schoolmates.  I firmly believe that if my supports had been consistent throughout secondary school, I would not have failed examination after examination for two years.  I also believe that if I had access to a lifelong assistive technology programme, as suggested by the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, and Enable Ireland in their 2016 discussion document, my school days would have been as normal as those of my classmates, instead of the constant struggle they were.  <\/p><p> My special needs assistant, SNA, hours, were halved at the start of sixth year, which had a serious impact on my ability to revise and was horrendously stressful.  I was unable to keep up in classes and had to be home-schooled for the remainder of the year with grinds to get me through my leaving certificate.  Once I got to college I was thrilled to discover that things were much different.  The disability support service in University College Cork could not have been more supportive.  I was offered grinds and assistive technology and I had a note-taker.  I was allowed to learn at my own speed and my independence, particularly through assistive technology, was encouraged and hugely supported.  I completed my BSc in Public Health in 2014 and followed on with an MA in Government and Politics in 2016.  My master's thesis focused on the impact of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 on children with disabilities and the results are as I expected.  Children with disabilities are not being supported in the way the legislation intended because, for the most part, it has not been meaningfully implemented.  <\/p><p> After spending almost six years in college, I found myself struggling to find work, even with my qualifications.  As soon as prospective employers saw my cane, there was a pitiful look and I would receive the \"we regret to inform you\" letter a week later.  I have a drawer full of such letters at home.  To counteract the blank spaces that were quickly filling up on my curriculum vitae, I volunteered or interned in sectors in which I had an interest.  It was only last November when I attended an interview where my disability and my cane were not given a second glance by the interview panel.  I succeeded in getting a job as a constituency assistant to Liadh N&iacute; Riada, the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP for Ireland South.  I have all the supports I could ask for in this job.  I have a large monitor and a scanner and these supports provide me with the help I need to do the job to the best of my ability.  My contract has just been renewed so I must be doing something right.  This is surely anecdotal evidence that once a person with a disability is given the correct supports, he or she can work on a level playing field with colleagues.  <\/p><p> However, with the good news comes a setback.  When I was granted my medical card in the early 2000s I had more sight than what I have today.  I have lost some of my peripheral vision in the past few years.  I have had my medical card for almost 20 years.  It was granted to me on medical grounds.  However, when I notified the Health Service Executive that I had begun working my medical card was revoked.  There was no appeals process open to me.  If I want the medical card back I have to begin a new application process, which will take a number of months and will probably be refused again on financial grounds.  I am highly unlikely to get my medical card back if I continue to do the job I worked so hard to get.  This puts a financial strain on me which is not faced by people without disabilities.  The HSE seems to believe my blindness was cured overnight when I got my job.  It has not factored the cost of low-vision aids covered by my medical card into its online means test.  There is no set price for these aids.  Depending on the aid a person needs, the cost could be &euro;100, &euro;200 or &euro;2,000 and upwards.  <\/p><p> The current funding model for assistive technology in the workplace is also completely outdated.  The HSE did not factor in the number of doctor and hospital visits I have each year.  I had well over 30 such visits last year.  While my financial circumstances may change throughout my life, my rights to health care, as a person with a disability, should never change.  I am very happy the committee is investigating labour activation for people with disabilities because it is very much needed and welcomed.  However, I earnestly appeal to the committee to consider the importance of lifelong access to assistive technology and medical supports when it publishes its report.<\/p><p> Challenges are faced by people with disabilities as they try to find employment.  These challenges are not faced by people without a disability.  Under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, people like me have a fundamental human right to full and effective participation and inclusion in society.  However, that right is of little use unless the correct supports are in place along the way.  People like me need assistive technology.  We need consistent educational supports and accessible facilities to allow us to participate on a level playing-field with our peers.  Accessibility is not just for buildings.  It is for every aspect of our lives in society.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Jessica N&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527591600,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Before I start I want to thank Senator Dolan, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Delaney and and Ms Doreen Magee for giving us the opportunity to address the committee today.  I think it is vitally important to get evidence and hear from people that are actually affected on a daily basis and hear about what we go through.<\/p> <p>  To give the committee a bit of background about me, I am 34 years old.  I have cerebral palsy which affects my motor control, so I require a motorised wheelchair to get around.  I also have a task dog named Gail, to retrieve dropped items, help me take my coat off and perform basic tasks.  Due to this, I no longer need as much help as I would.  This has been provided to me by Dogs for the Disabled.  I am a two-time Paralympian and a former world champion in the sport of boccia.  I have just completed my degree in communications at Dublin City University, and I also compete for that university in powerchair football at European level. <\/p> <p>  Growing up in Ireland with any type of impairment is hard, because it is always a battle to access service that one needs.  I have been very lucky in that both my Mum and Dad instilled a good work ethic in me and always told me not to accept the norm.  Growing up in Ireland, one wonders whether one will be lucky enough to gain employment.  The answer for me is \"yes\", despite the fact that the system does its best to keep a person like me claiming social welfare.  In 2006, I started working for East Coast FM in production.  The station gradually upskilled me to mixing and producing, before I moved into the role of sports reporter on a freelance basis.  The management and staff of East Coast FM have always challenged me to become the best that I can be.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, I secured a full-time job at Sky Ireland.  It is an outstanding employer with a world-class inclusivity policy, and any supports I have required have been put in place.  My colleagues are the best that anyone could wish for, and they really take excellent care of Gail and me.  I am now a service and loyalty specialist, having been promoted.  When I started working, I lost my disability and medical card after a few months, and my travel pass two years later.  The income disregard of &euro;120 has not been renewed since 2006.  That really needs to be looked at again.  The members of the committee also might want to factor in that the disability allowance payment is exactly the same as the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.  Unemployment is a temporary condition, while I think the committee will accept that cerebral palsy, autism and most other physical disabilities are permanent.  The State does not factor in the extra overheads that people with disabilities encounter every day.  There is also no consideration in the income tax system of the extra costs that a person with a disability has to face.  <\/p> <p>  I require a personal assistant to help me function, which I get for ten hours a week.  These ten hours were allocated to me in 2011, and that plan has never been renewed or updated, nor has anyone ever asked me if it has changed.  Last February, I was afforded the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on the difficulties that I was facing with Irish Rail.   After giving evidence to the committee, I was targeted because I dared to speak out to the media and expose the challenges that a person in a wheelchair faces on a daily basis.  As most of the members will know, Mr. Delaney is very good at what he does.  He agreed to advocate for me and help me to resolve those issues.  He attended a meeting with myself and the new CEO, Mr. Jim Meade.  Ciar&aacute;n dissected the evidence and presented my case, outlining what I was subjected to.  In fairness to Mr. Meade, he acted on that.  My fine was rescinded and I was offered lots of help.  In that regard, I would like to thank Irish Rail and the new chairman, Mr. Frank Allen.  Irish Rail is becoming a better company, trying to improve services for people in wheelchairs.  <\/p> <p>  Another part of my problem with the current system concerns my supports.<\/p><p>Twelve per cent of my monthly salary is spent on funding additional personal assistant hours because I cannot function on ten hours per week.  I have the long-term illness coverage because I have cerebral palsy.  I am also asthmatic but because asthma is not a cerebral palsy related condition my inhalers are no longer covered under this scheme.<\/p><p> In terms of education, I have been really lucky in terms of the supports provided to me by Dublin City University.  A friend of mine wants to pursue a course in a college of further education but she is being denied access because the college refuses to purchase a hoist or put in place supports to enable her to use the toilets.  Senator Dolan and Ciar&aacute;n Delaney have done a lot of work to improve access.  This is another barrier being put in the way of a person trying to access a fundamental service.  People with disabilities are often forgotten in the crossfire.  We are not seen as a large voting group because we cannot engage in mass protest and so it is slightly easier to make cuts to our services.  There are many advocacy groups and people on large salaries making decisions that affect us but up to now engagement with people with disabilities who face additional overheads in this regard has been rare.  It is important that meetings like this continue to happen.<\/p><p> A few months, I had to have my glasses upgraded.  When I applied for PRSI relief in an effort to recoup some of that cost I was told I was not entitled to it because I had not worked for five consecutive years.  There is supposed to be a five-year transition period for people who move from the disability allowance to employment but that transition period was never applied to me.  My allowance was taken from me straight away.  When I engaged with the then Department of Social Protection I was told by a member of staff that if I returned to part-time work I would get all of my benefits back.  This is a damning indictment of the system.  If the Government continues to decimate supports, people with disabilities will not move into employment.  There are plenty of people with disabilities who are able to work.  However, if in doing so their supports are withdrawn it will have a massive impact on their lives.  We are supposed to be afforded fundamental human rights.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, has been ratified but the protocol has not.  In Ireland, we do little bits but we do not do enough.  People with disabilities get a few crumbs every now and again to keep them happy.  We need more than token gestures, we need action.  I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for commencing the process of appointing people with disabilities to the boards of public transport bodies and to Sport Ireland to help improve fundamental services.  All Ministers and committees should follow this lead and actively engage, as we are today, with people with disabilities to ensure the system works more conducively for people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.

I propose to use this opportunity to speak from personal experience and also as a professional working in the area of education supporting people with disabilities to transition from further and higher education into employment.  I graduated from University College Dublin in 1994 with a social science degree, following which it took me about one year to enter employment.  I can categorically say that this was possible because I had a personal assistant throughout my education.  I was also fortunate enough to be able to use my personal assistant service to transition into employment.<\/p><p>The reason for that is I came into the system under the old conditions.  Therefore, I did not have to give up my personal assistant service after I graduated from college.  Nowadays, the system is very different.  The funding structures, etc., are different.  When a young person graduates from further or higher education, he or she no longer has an automatic entitlement to a personal assistant when he or she enters employment.  Obviously, not everyone requires this support.  It is required by many people with mobility issues and physical disabilities.<\/p><p> I would like to explain what personal assistants do for people in their workplaces.  My personal assistant assists me in doing my job.  I am employed by my employer.  I am the person with the qualifications to carry out my role.  My personal assistant follows my instructions and carries out tasks under my supervision that I am physically incapable of doing.  Everything comes back on me as my ultimate responsibility.  My personal assistant is not a burden on my employer.  I employ her.  It is really important for this to be clearly understood from an employer's perspective.  This service or entitlement is no longer provided to many young people, and indeed older people.  I categorically believe this is a fundamental barrier to employment.<\/p><p> In recent years, I have been working in the further education service with the Rehab group.  I provide a service to people who are transitioning from special education into the mainstream system.  Many of these people have been told from a very young age that they are failures and cannot and should not have expectations for themselves.  Their parents also hear this when their children are very young.  Part of my job is to challenge not only the internalised perceptions of these people, but also the perceptions of society at large.  It is worrying that numbers have been decreasing instead of increasing in recent years.<\/p><p> I thought about this aspect of the matter as I prepared to come to this morning's meeting.  In Ireland, we are very good at getting European funding and running very successful projects that enable people to try out things.  The outcomes can be very successful.  I was fortunate enough to be involved and employed in the career pathways project, which was initiated by Trinity College.  The purpose of the project was to support people with disabilities as they prepare to make the transition from study to employment.  The outcomes of this project, which enabled and supported people in getting jobs, were very positive.<\/p><p> During the course of this three-year project, I helped people with everything from CV preparation and interview skills to disclosure of disability.  How should someone who has a hidden disability disclose that to a prospective employer?  At what stage should this be done?  How can one become confident in articulating one's needs and selling one's qualities?  How can one demonstrate to oneself and others that one has a valuable contribution to make in the labour market?  Despite all the positive outcomes - this project has won two awards for the substantial impact it has made in people's lives - unfortunately it was decided to discontinue the project when the funding dried up.<\/p><p>Many people were left without a service, essentially.  People's lives are worth much more than that.  I am one of the lucky ones.  I should not feel lucky.  This should be an automatic human right for everyone.<\/p><p> The alarming lack of a comprehensive career guidance service in special schools has been highlighted in the media in recent weeks.  It is old news, but it really has to change.  It demonstrates the lack of value placed by the Government and by society at large on anyone who is different or does not fit the mould.  If there is one message I would like to get across to the committee today, it is that there needs to be more communication between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is only through constant communication, dialogue and negotiation that the issues which prevent people from accessing education and employment can be addressed.<\/p><p> As Ms N&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in and Mr. Moran have demonstrated, people with disabilities want to work.  From my perspective, it is very uncomfortable to be asked by parents, and others who see me performing in my job, to explain how I have succeeded.  When I share a certain amount with them, as appropriate, they ask me how they can get what I have.  In such circumstances, I have to tell them honestly that they do not have an automatic human right to that.  All I can do is give them some pointers and guidelines on how to advocate for themselves.  In my opinion, that is no longer acceptable in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Daly.

Nine years ago, I was drugged and violently assaulted.  I suffered multiple fractures of my skull and multiple brain injuries.  I am deaf in one ear and I have various other issues.  I am also invisible because I look normal, whatever that means.  I was working for a semi-State company.  I had been there ten years.  When I got out of hospital, I walked out the door with no support - no medical appointments, no support numbers, no occupational therapy, nothing.  I walked out the door 19 days after receiving a brain injury.  I had to get on with my life with no support from anybody.  The semi-State company for which I had worked for less than ten years was less than supportive.  It forced me to go back to work after three months.  It insisted that there was nothing wrong with me.  Indeed, my bosses said I was not deaf and suggested I was making it all up.<\/p> <p>  This is the unfortunate part of being invisible, or what I normally call \"hidden\".  I am high functioning.  Brain-injured people who look brain injured or disabled have a large advantage over me.  I would not call it a slight advantage.  The next three years were hell.  They gave me no support.  When I found DeafHear in North Frederick Street, I walked in the door and said that I was deaf in one ear and had suffered brain injuries.  I asked the people in DeafHear for help and they gave it to me.  I also found Headway Ireland, which has saved my life twice at this stage.<\/p><p>It is a great support group which has supported me to this day and, I suspect, it will probably do so for the rest of my life.  I had to knock on that group's door and say: \"Excuse me, can you help me?\" <\/p><p> I thought myself to walk again, as I am deaf in one ear and I tend to fall over.  I was falling over a lot.  I have some false teeth, and I am due to get some more, as I kept falling over.  I got no physiotherapy to help me with my vertigo and deafness.<\/p><p> Meanwhile the company I worked in was trying to sack me at every hand's turn.  Eventually, I could not take it any more and I went out on sick leave again.  I got a letter coming up to Christmas advising me I was being sacked because I had no underlying medical conditions.  I have that letter from the chief medical officer of a semi-State company at home.  The union backed me.  It had an extraordinary meeting with us and the chief medical officer, for the first time in the history of a semi-State organisation, changed his mind and gave me my superannuation over Christmas when the union was closed and I could not get any support.  <\/p><p> I was 48 years old and had been thrown on the scrap heap.  I applied for social welfare benefit and I was awarded an invalidity pension.  God help one if one is on an invalidity pension, as one cannot even volunteer to do anything, because if one does, one will lose benefits.  I tried to apply for a hearing aid.  I do not know if the members have noticed me turning around drastically to listen to the speakers to my left, which is my deaf side.  DeafHear helped me, which was great, but it could not supply me with a hearing aid because it is granted on basis of having of a medical card, not on the basis of pay related social insurance, PRSI.  That is another one of those invisible barriers or traps about which Senator Dolan spoke.<\/p><p> When I awarded an invalidity pension I applied for rent allowance and I was told I would get it.  That was grand.  I submitted the form and waited.  They said it would take a few months as there was a backlog, but nothing happened.  I rang the Department and was told it had moved offices and that there was a backlog so I waited.  I was still paying rent out my superannuation payment, which was rapidly decreasing.  That went on for nine or ten months.  I had to submit the form three times and on the third occasion, I was told I would not be granted rent allowance.  I had to pay my landlord over half of my welfare payments, bearing in mind my level of payment is on the poverty line.  That was the position I was in for another few months.<\/p><p> I was on the housing list.  I was told by the Department that if I was on the housing list, I would get rent allowance.  It was great to hear that, as I had been refused it previously.  I went into the office to apply for rent allowance and was awarded it, which was great.  Rent increased.  I was dutiful and submitted the form but I was cut off again.<\/p><p> I dealt with forms all my life, specifically during the past 13 years.  When one goes into a social protection office there is no communication and it as if it one should not talk.  I wanted to get medication because I have brain injuries and have issues sleeping.  They wanted to me give me benzodiazepines.  I wanted medication I could buy across the counter in Walmart in the US or in any chemist in Spain.  I tried to explain that but I was told that I was not 55 years of age and that I was not getting it.  I replied I was disabled, have brain injuries and could not take that medication, but they said it did not matter.<\/p><p> If the members look at this line of people, they will note we are all disabled.  However, we are all different.  We all need to be spoken to, not at.  Too many times we are spoken at.  I was very fortunate two years ago with the help of Headway to make contact with the Disability Federation of Ireland, which has been wonderful and has helped me to do these types of things.  I was involved in Headway's I See Beyond campaign and I did not realise at the time I was asked to be a part of that for my own benefit.  The idea is to see beyond the disability, to see the person.  I was fortunate enough to be in Brussels as a representative of Disability Federation of Ireland for the 4th EU Parliament of Persons with Disabilities.  I was involved also in the Make Way Day campaign, the aim of which is to get able bodied people to think about us for a change, to step out of their position and try to see matters from our side.<\/p><p> A person in a wheelchair was left on a roadside last week because able bodied people would not get out of the way.  We face that every day.  When we deal with Departments it the same, if not worst.  I am not the same as Jessica or Eileen but all Departments treat us the same way.  We are not the same; we are all different.  They do not talk to us.  I cannot work as I am not allowed to work.  However, I have a radio show every Thursday.  It is Viva Vox Dublin City FM 103.2, a disability show with a difference.  I can work and I know I can but I am not allowed to do so.  My former employer threw me on the scrap heap and the Government seems to want to box me into a little corner until I reach the age of 66 and then, from its viewpoint, I stop being disabled.  At the age of 66 we stop being disabled and just become old.  That is the reason for the 13.5 %.<\/p><p>Do members know what it feels like to be constantly pushed to the edge?  Perhaps they did not but maybe they do now.  I thank them for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Kearney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kearney for his presentation.

It was not good for me because I did not even learn to read or write.  I was not told anything about work or anything else when I was at school.  I was sent to a nursing home to work.  The work was okay but I was not properly paid for it and I got very little time off.  I was not happy there.  A social worker arranged for me to be moved me to a service.  It was a big hospital and I lived on a ward there.  After living on that ward for a few years, I moved into one of the bungalows on the complex and from there I moved into a residential house on Aylmer Road in Newcastle, County Dublin.  Nine of us lived there, four boys and five girls.  I later moved from there into independent living.  When I was moved into that hospital the social worker told me I would be there for only six months but that ended up being 32.5 years.<\/p> <p>  While I was in that service, I had to work in a big workshop packing boxes and then in a newsagent's shop owned by the service.  We did not get paid properly for that work.  I was first paid the equivalent of 50p a week, then &pound;5 a week and then &pound;10 a week.  It was hard work for very little money.  When I worked in those workshops packing bottles, then packing boxes and making box dividers for a Smurfit company, I stopped going back to work after at 3.30 p.m. break because I was not being paid properly and it was slave labour.  I called them sweatshops, not workshops.  That was the name I gave them many years ago.<\/p> <p>  I was lucky and got a job with Inclusion Ireland.  When I worked in those workshops, I also worked part-time once a week in the Shadowbox Theatre Company in Bray, for which I was paid by F&Aacute;S.  When I went to work with Inclusion Ireland, I realised that I could not really do anything.  It was a real job and I am now properly paid for working 20 hours a week.  It is the first real job I have had in my life.  I have been working with Inclusion Ireland for 13 years.  It is one of the best jobs I have had.  I applied for other jobs and submitted my curriculum vitae but I was discriminated against because none of those employers got back to me.<\/p> <p>  I got to work for Inclusion Ireland because I knew a lady called Lisa who was working there and I used to attend its meetings.  They told there was some work going and that I would be able to do it.  After that, the people involved in the 360 initiative came out to the hospital and interviewed me.  Lisa helped me with the interview, but I could not see her because she was in the background.<\/p><p>I got the message through my television, speaking for people's rights to have a proper job and proper wages.<\/p><p> I cannot work more than that or I will lose all my benefits.  I would be afraid to lose my bus pass.  It would cost about &euro;15 return from Navan to Dublin for each day if I had no bus pass.  If I had to pay that all my money would be gone, because I am only working part-time.  Then I would not be able to pay my bills and my mortgage.  <\/p><p> I would not be much better off in full-time work if I lost my travel pass and my medical card.  I lost my medical card once when I was in these services.  The social welfare management came to me and to my key worker and told me that I was not entitled to one.  They took my medical card and they wanted the bus pass but I would not give it to them because I had to travel to work every day and I travel around the country a lot.  They said I had too much money in the bank.  They wanted bank statements and everything.  It cost me more than &euro;600 to get bank statements from the first day I opened a bank account.  They were not happy with them, so they asked me to send them in again.  It cost me another &euro;600 to send them again.  They would not do anything for me, so I contacted my TD, who at that time was Deputy Joanna Tuffy, who was based in Lucan.  She helped me to get it back.  Then they took it off me again, saying I had too much money in the bank.  The reason I had too much money in the bank was that the service used to take money from our disability allowance every week.  They used to give us &euro;10 a week and then later it went up to &euro;20.  The most we ever got out of that was &euro;30 a week.  When Mary Harney was in the Minister for Health and Children in 2005, she said that people in these services, in nursing homes and independent living, would have to be given back the money that had been taken from them.  The amount depended on how long someone was in the services.  We got a small sum in 2005 and it took three years for an organisation in Tralee to sort out the money.  People received sums ranging from &euro;20,000 up to &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  I kept that money.<\/p><p> Later on, I went to a meeting with my boss, Mr. Paddy Connolly, the CEO of Inclusion Ireland.  I heard about an organisation called Possibilities Plus.  That is a group that helps people to move out of services, independent living and nursing homes and live a life of their own.  We started having meetings with the service and the HSE.  It took three years for me to access that funding from the HSE and the services and to find a place to live.  The anti-bullying group is in DCU.  I am a part of that group.  That group and Inclusion Ireland helped me to get my own place.  <\/p><p> When I started at Inclusion Ireland I used to get everything wrong because of my reading.  They organised for me to attend reading and writing class with the national learning centre in Mountjoy.<\/p><p>I asked them to see if they could get a course for me because I was doing everything wrong.  I was putting letters in the wrong envelopes and putting the wrong addresses on envelopes.  They were all coming back.  Inclusion Ireland was losing a lot of money in stamps, so the management got me a place on this course.  This course went on for about seven years, but they told me at the beginning it was only going to be a two-year course.  I used to go in every Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. before I went into work.  I had homework, which I did for two hours after work on Thursday nights before I went in on Friday.  When I did that, it refreshed my mind for the work I was doing in the college with a one-to-one teacher.<\/p><p> It was great.  I can read and write now and I have also learned to use computers.  My second chance at education really helped me in my job.  It helped me to get where I am now.  I could not read, write, use computers or anything, even photocopying.  Now I can do it all with the support of Inclusion Ireland.  I take part in advocacy groups about rights and independent living and I am involved in focus groups.  I have been working with them for 13 years.  I think the staff are A1.<\/p><p> I was still unhappy living in the service.  I had moved to a group home, but had no choice in who I lived with.  I could not choose my support worker.  I was not at the interviews to choose who I wanted to work with me.  People were just thrown onto a case.  The service would simply say that a certain person was my key worker.  That is wrong.  People with disabilities should have the right to be at those interviews and choose who they want to support them in living a good life.  I wanted to move out.  I started to fight to get a personal budget.  The service agreed to give me enough money to get eight hours of support.  The budget took three years, and it took three years to find a place with the help of Inclusion Ireland, the anti-bullying group, and Possibilities Plus.  <\/p><p> My new support service is Possibilities Plus.  That organisation has my budget and pays a person to work for me for eight hours a week.  He has to do eight hours a week, or 32 hours a month.  I was the one who interviewed him, and for the first time in my life I chose the support worker I wanted.  It was a big change for me when I moved out.  I could not leave the house for the first six weeks, because I was used to support around me the whole time.  Now I get out of the house.  My support worker helps me to do that.  He gets me out doing activities, and he helps me make friends.  He helps me with what I cannot do, but I tell him what I want done.  It is not about what he wants done, because I am his boss.  I am the one who employed him.  The HSE gives him some of my budget, paid via Possibilities Plus.  If he does not do that eight hours a week, we can bank them for something else later on.  I said to him when I first moved out that I needed a bit of support when I went to certain places.  Now, I can do it all on my own.<\/p><p>I bought my own apartment in Navan and it is great.  I picked the paint, the bed clothes, the floors and all the electrical stuff myself.  I never did that before.  I got a loan from the credit union in Rathcoole.  I repay it out of my payment from Inclusion Ireland at the end of every month.  The money goes to the credit union on the first of every month because I do not get paid until the end of the month.  I have a new life living on my own because I never lived at home with my family.  I was always away from home.  I lived in services, in boarding schools, and did not get a proper education until I came to Inclusion Ireland.  Fair play to it for organising all this for me and for supporting me over the last 13 years in which I have been working with it.<\/p><p> Brian is my support worker.  I interviewed him and chose him with Dr. Bob McCormack from Possibilities Plus.  I went to a meeting with Mr. Paddy Connolly in Leopardstown and I heard about Possibilities Plus.  I told the people there that my family and the staff did not want me to move out of the services and that they would not let me move out.  I said that I should get what I want in life and that it is not what they want.  I kept fighting for it but it took three years of meetings with the family, with Inclusion Ireland, with the organisation and the HSE.  Someone said this person has plenty of money and he should be able to go out and buy his own place.  I just said to myself that I would think about it.<\/p><p> I thought hard about what to do with the money from the Government in 2008.  I put it into my own bank.  I told the staff I was not putting it into Bank of Ireland in Rathcoole because everyone else was.  It was my own choice to do that.  I brought the cheque in and lodged it myself.  I did that for the first time in my life.  After that, they did not have a leg to stand on because I was able to open an account myself.<\/p><p> Brian helped me to get linked in with lots of things and services in Navan.  I go to bingo on Tuesday nights and for the first couple of months, he used to come with me to support me.  I said to him that I did not want him to do that anymore and that we could bank those hours for something else.  He stopped coming with me and now I go on my own.  People keep a seat for me every week.  I got to know people from going to bingo.  That did not happen when I was in the services because I never got that chance.  I go to a trad music session twice a week.  I go the Central Bar and I go to The Lantern in Navan on Wednesday nights.  I meet people in the pub and I got to know the people who play the music there.  It is the same in the Central Bar where I got to make new friends there.  I never got a chance to do anything like that when I was the services.<\/p><p>I go to the Special Olympics through the Arch club in Navan which is for people with a disability.  They play games for two hours every Thursday night and the club picks people to go to the Special Olympics.  The first year I went, the people at the club said I was good at table tennis and put me through to the Special Olympics for the first time.  That was the first time in my life I had ever engaged in activities.  I went to the Special Olympics and made the table tennis final.  I came second.  A year later I got a card that stated I would be part of the Special Olympics for the following five years.  <\/p><p> I do all of my own shopping and cooking.  Brian might have to come with me sometimes to help if I am going to buy clothes or anything like that because I do not know how to match clothes.  He also taught me how to cook.  I have friends in Beaufort in Navan who I go to on Mondays for a bit of lunch.  They support me and also taught me how to cook, but I can do it all of it on my own now.  If Brian is working with me at night time, I normally have dinner ready for him when he comes and if he is working with me in day time, I have breakfast ready.  This only came about because I met Dr. Bob McCormack one day.  I was lucky, but many people with disabilities are not so lucky.  They have not moved out of the services.  Years ago the Government stated people in the services should be moved out to live independently and choose their own support services.  I do not know when that is going to happen.  I was one of the lucky ones because I had to fight all my life for everything I wanted.  A personal budget helps me to live a life of my own.  It is great having my own budget and to be able to look after it myself, with Possibilities Plus, the HSE and Brian working with me.  From the budget, Brian gets something like &euro;50 which we can use to go out for a cup of coffee or a scone.  We cannot go for a meal or anything like it because there is a limit to the money available and I cannot go over budget or the hours allocated.  If I did, Possibilities Plus would have to pay extra, but it does not have the money to do so.  It is also great to be able to hang on to my own budget through my organisation.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening to me and having me here.  I hope everything goes well for everyone here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Alford","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Alford.

I am now going to make Ms Dina McAnaspie's contribution on her behalf.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>I attend a day service three days per week and work part-time two days per week.  I work in a bar on two-hour shifts, that is, four hours per week.  I really enjoy working and my goal is to work in a full-time job in retail in the future.  However, I have come across many things that have made getting a job very difficult for me.  When I was younger, I attended a special school.  There was no career guidance in my special school, so I did not get the same advice and help that other students get in mainstream schools across the country.  As well as this, there was no option to go into transition year in my school.  This means that I did not get the chance to get work experience in transition year the way that students in mainstream schools do.  When I was in school, I did get to have some work experience working in a charity shop.  This was a really great experience and it gave me a taste of what having a job was like.  I also got to experience what it is like to have a job.  I believe there should be more work experience opportunities available for people with intellectual disabilities.<br \/><br \/>When I left school I attended a day service.  I really enjoy attending my day service but at some point I want to be able to move on and get a full-time job.  I want to work just like everyone else.  At the moment, the staff members and my key workers help me with applying for jobs.  They help me put together my CVs and send them to workplaces.  It can be very hard to get a job, however, and it is also very hard to get the work experience one needs to get a job.<br \/><br \/>One of the problems that many people with intellectual disabilities come up against is that if we get a full-time job and leave the day service, there is no guarantee that those services will hold our places.  If things do not work out in a job, some people are left with nothing afterwards.  I feel that people with disabilities should be supported to get a job.  They should be supported during the job, if needed, and also supported if things do not work out.  At the moment, the system puts people off trying to get employment in case they lose their supports and services.  I thank the committee members for their time.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ailish Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McAnaspie and Ms Ryan.

Will she indicate what the cost to her has been since she took up her job up in November?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Moran for his story.  Fair play to him for fighting for access to rail services.  It is really important.  I live in Newbridge.  There is a lift there, but one has to give 24 hours' notice to use it, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Since it is in place, it should be serviced all the time.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran referred to 12% of his salary going on additional PA hours.  The difference between Mr. Moran and Ms Daly is that Ms Daly was in the system before.  It has made a difference to her life, but Mr. Moran has to pay extra to try to live a normal life.<\/p><p>That is really important to note.<\/p><p> For Ms Daly to have the system she has is really important, as is the fact that her circumstances can be compared with those of someone who does not have it.  There could have been a fundamental barrier to employment for Ms Daly.  Therefore, we need to examine the aids and supports.  This is why I believe we need to bring in prospective employers to talk about these issues.  Ms Daly is absolutely right that we need constant dialogue and negotiation.<\/p><p> To Mr. Kearney, I say that I sometimes believe having an acquired brain injury is nearly the most difficult place for anybody with a disability.  It can be quite difficult to access supports.  There is a really grey area.  So much needs to be done in this regard.  That one cannot volunteer with an invalidity pension is an issue.  There is so much one could do as a volunteer for so many organisations.  It is wrong that we cannot get volunteers.<\/p><p> Mr. Alford addressed the area of exploitation really well and said some people in a vulnerable position can be exploited.  He has certainly fought the good fight in terms of getting the services he needed.  He should have and could have been able to learn to read and write when he was very young.  It is so sad that he did not get the chance to do that at that point.  Life could have been quite different at that stage.  I refer to having adequate literacy and numeracy.  When my brother went to a special school, my mother was told that he would not be able to read or write.  She said he will read and write.  He is one of 11.  I am the eldest of 11 children.  By the time my brother was five, he was reading and writing.  Every day, his encyclopaedic knowledge of everything amazes me.  He is always reading and writing.  It is so wrong that Mr. Alford was in the position he was in.  He has really fought back.  The next time he comes here, I hope he brings lunch for all of us.  He is a very good chef.<\/p><p> I thank Ms McAnaspie.  She touched on the area of transition year, not having the possibility to do work experience and the fact that there is no career guidance.  I intend to raise this at a meeting of the education committee.  Mr. Moran mentioned his colleague with the hoist.  This was mentioned to me.  I am happy to raise any such specific issues with the education committee with a view to trying to help.  I thank all the delegates so much.  I look forward to working together with John, Michael and Senator Dolan to determine how we can help in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#P00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":788,"content":"<p>For the witnesses, the gentleman who has arrived and whom I said would be a bit late is Deputy Michael Harty, the Chairman of the heath committee.

I was in the audiovisual room a number of months ago when Senator Dolan brought in witnesses to give their life histories and to outline how their disabilities affect them.  I do understand the position but, unfortunately, I did miss the delegates' contributions this morning.<\/p> <p>  From a medical perspective, I believe in the importance of work to health.  Work is like a drug.  If people who have a disability can get a job, it lifts their personal status and self-esteem, and it also benefits them in so many other ways.  Work is like a drug in that it can benefit people greatly.  At meetings of the health committee, we have seen that health is one aspect of disability but there are many others.  There are many social determinants of health, including education, about which we have been speaking this morning, and housing, transport and social protection.<\/p><p>These all tie in with providing an enhanced quality of life to people with disabilities.  In rural Ireland, the lack of transport is a huge inhibiting factor for people in terms of getting employment and access to work.<\/p><p> Personal budgets should be introduced in the near future because they give people with disabilities a totally different aspect to their independence, meaning that they can decide how to live and how their supports are used to their advantage, because each person is different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#Q00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Some of them are not strangers to us but it is probably the first time others have appeared before any committee, which, I know, is a daunting task at the best of times.  We are here to help and to put a pathway in place to assist the witnesses and the people they have quite ably represented this morning.<\/p> <p>  Is Brian here with Mr. Alford today?  Mr. Alford mentioned him quite regularly in his contribution.  I do not know who is the more tolerant of the two.<\/p> <p>  I have read the submission from the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, which touched on all of the statistics and figures in terms of unemployment levels.  That is all fine.  However, to hear at first hand about the barriers in respect of getting into work and sustaining employment that are put in place by the State is critical.  Some announcements have been made in the past year concerning medical cards and the travel pass.  Last year, the Taoiseach announced that anyone in receipt of a long-term disability payment who gained employment could retain those benefits for five years.  I am not sure of the views of the witnesses on that matter, but I do not believe five years is long enough.  It is a serious issue which many people with disabilities face.  Mr. Moran is from Bray, my home town, and I know him.  He has had many battles with our public transport system, including, as one of my colleagues mentioned, having to give notice 24 hours in advance when travelling on public transport.  Even with that, there are huge failures within the system.  Having a free travel pass is one thing, but having a public transport system that actually works is another.  Many people have to rely on taxis.  Mr. Moran mentioned in a conversation before the meeting that he might pay up to &euro;500 a month for taxis because of the failures of the public transport system.  If anyone else has issues such as that, it would be very useful to know about them.<\/p> <p>  Another announcement was made about the earnings disregard relating to the medical card.  A couple of contributors have spoken about the fear of losing the medical cards.  A colleague and friend of mine, Mr. John Doyle, who has unfortunately passed away, always said that when people with disabilities get jobs, their disabilities seem to be cured overnight and they lose their medical cards straight away.  One of our guests mentioned this and stated that his problems were cured because he got a job, which is absolutely crazy.  John Doyle, who was confined to a wheelchair, detailed the additional expenses that come with being disabled.<\/p><p>He spoke about the price of the cushion on his wheelchair and how much it cost to replace it.  The medical card was a cushion to fall back on which sustained him when he was unemployed.  That was a barrier that stopped him.  He became very friendly with Senator Dolan, the DFI and some other fantastic organisations.<\/p><p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has made some announcements in respect of the earnings disregard.  We have not seen the proposals as yet; perhaps the witnesses could share their views on them.<\/p><p> Ms McAnaspie spoke about entering the workforce without training or experience.  I am not sure what part of the country she is from, but I have some experience of dealing with WALK, which is a fantastic organisation working in the Louth area which works with people with disabilities and employers.  It helps to place people in employment and works alongside them.  It is a fantastic model that could be replicated across the State quite easily.  It works for both the individual and the employer.  I am not sure if any of the witnesses have any experience of that organisation.<\/p><p> In 1995, the Barcelona Declaration was made and the Government signed up to it.  The declaration set targets in many different areas, one of which was employment.  It aimed for 3% compliance quota to try to get people with disabilities into State jobs, whether with local authorities or Departments.  With the recruitment embargo in place, I am not sure whether that target was achieved.  However, since bodies - whether local authorities or across the board - have started hiring again, I know that people with disabilities have been completely overlooked.  The State is the largest employer in the country and it could easily achieve the targets that were set.  There are many brilliant people, including the witnesses, who are living with disabilities and who want to get into the workforce.  The State should not only achieve those targets, it should exceed them.<\/p><p> Ms N&iacute; Mhaolain brought up a serious point.  She mentioned that her supports were halved when she was in sixth year.  That was a critical time in her education and she described the impact the withdrawal of her supports had.  Unfortunately, we are aware of the delays that children face for accessing occupational therapy services.  Ms N&iacute; Mhaolain touched on the critical importance of having those services in place and the interventions that have to happen at an early stage.  Her comments on that certainly hit the mark and highlighted a serious issue that applies across the board.  Having the appropriate level of services cut by 50% at that stage had a real detrimental impact on her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#R00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I commend the Co-Chairman on getting the three committees together.

It reminds me of a bird whose wings are caught.

I have raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in both the D&aacute;il and at the health committee and he has said he is aware of the issue and will look at it.  We must watch that going forward.<\/p><p> I note what Ms Daly said about the PA being employed by her rather than by her employer.  It is a very good point.

People see it as a plus and as a minus but it is something around which greater public awareness and training are required regarding how to deal with someone who does not appear to have a disability but does.  It is something I am interested in discussing further with the witnesses.  How can we go forward in that regard?  Mr. Alford referred to the importance of involving persons with disabilities in the selection of their key workers.  I agree fully on that.  If one is going to be spending so much time with someone, one must ensure that one gets on with that person.  Brian is very lucky if Mr. Alford has his dinner ready some days.  I hope to meet him some day as Mr. Alford obviously thinks a great deal of him, which is lovely to see.

I will not repeat a lot of what has been said and will, instead, ask a few particular questions which have arisen for me.  Mr. Moran mentioned not being seen as a voter base and being unable to organise quickly enough to protest or respond immediately when things happen.  Last week, I was surprised to hear at Viviane Rath's session in UCD on political representation that there is a stipulation that PAs cannot attend any sort of political engagement.  As such, PAs cannot go to political events with the person they assist.  Can someone comment on that?  If someone's PA cannot accompany him or her to political events, it dilutes that person's ability to function as an active citizen, to exercise representation or to seek to vindicate his or her rights.  It is an important issue and it should be examined.<\/p> <p>  I know Ms Daly from the amazing work she has done in Trinity College and from my involvement in the career service there.  She spoke about the three-year work project in Trinity.  Can she touch on some of the positive outcomes of that work?  She stated that people's lives cannot depend on project funding.  That is important.  These projects cannot be short term in nature when disability is a long-term matter for many.  My own daughter is on the spectrum and went into Trinity this year where she really saw the benefits of the disability service in the college.  I compare that to what people are saying around further education and the disparity between the further education sector and the universities in the context of disability services.  Can Ms Daly refer in greater detail to the beneficial outcomes of her work?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Alford referred to the residential spaces he has been in and how horrible that time was for him in not being able to live independently.  Can he clarify his references to workhouses?  Did residential services send him to work in these places for little to no pay?  How did that relationship come about and how did he end up in such employment?  Was he directed there from a particular service or did it happen because he was living in a residential service setting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#T00600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":800,"content":"<p>The presentations have been really wonderful and lots of issues have been raised.  I will try to avoid some of the ones which have already been touched on, including the important point around the role of the embargo on public service recruitment.  I was struck by the issue of invisibility which Mr. Kearney spoke about.  He referred to invisible disability.  I was also struck by that issue in the context of what Mr. Alford said about residential institutions.  He said that when he was in residential care, he was unable to participate in his community and was not given the necessary level of visibility.  He has described how he now has that.<\/p> <p>  I was also struck in particular by how that is reflected in payments and the invalidity pension.  I also sit on the social protection committee and I am very interested in why a person would be on that payment rather than on disability allowance, which would permit some capacity to work.  It is a real worry that they are waiting for a person to become 66 when the disability will disappear.  It seems that those who are working or who are not on disability allowance see their disability or needs disappear because they are no longer on that payment.  It is a real concern given that there are people with disabilities who are working, who are older and who are younger.  They are in all those other parts of the system.  As such, the idea that a person comes into focus every now and again is a real concern.  The witnesses might comment on that.  I was struck by the idea that the pension penalises involvement, be it in politics or volunteerism.<\/p> <p>  Ms McAnaspie spoke about this also.  One wants a system that encourages one and good points were made on work experience, transition year and career guidance.  A narrative is coming across all the time that supports are in tension with work and engagement, which should not be the case.  We have a constant concern around loss of supports in relation to employment versus the narrative we need around supports which assist engagement.  Ms N&iacute; Mhaolain spoke very well about the idea of assistive supports.  Does any witness want to comment on how to reframe the dialogue around supports?<\/p> <p>  I was struck also by the amount of unpaid time required to negotiate bureaucracy and the gaps that opens up in one's career path or personal progression.  It is a huge amount of time.  Mr. Moran and Mr. Alford referred in particular to the huge amount of time that has had to be put in on advocacy to improve our services.  What Mr. Moran said about it being important that it be there at the beginning was striking.  We must have representatives in all of these institutions and committees at board level so that it does not fall to individual advocates.  Nonetheless, the witnesses might want to speak further to the optional protocol which is a way for individual advocates to press for improvements and demand justice from our systems.  That said, it should not fall to individuals to take those cases.<\/p> <p>  I have specific points for Ms Daly.  She spoke about transition points.  This is what we are really trying to tackle here.  The points on post-education supports were striking.  These are supports post-education around a person's next step.  She also mentioned further education.  Something that is a real concern for us on the social protection committee is the need to ensure that people are given further education options.  People in the social welfare system may not be coming straight out of secondary school and into college.  How do we ensure that further education is brought in and that people in their 30s and 40s are brought back into the education system?  What has been Ms Daly's experience?<\/p><p>Mr. Alford spoke about the importance of choice very eloquently; the choice of who one lives and works with, who supports one.  The personal budget is a key part of that.<\/p><p> I was also struck by what he said about having a reserve of funds because he had been wrongly exploited in the past, which allowed him make long-term plans.  Could people touch on the issue of how it can be difficult for persons on disability allowance to make the big leaps or the investment in a substantial change in their life?  The personalised budget is a weekly payment but how can we support moments of big change and give people the capacity to plan their own futures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018052900002#U00100","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527591600,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I thank my Oireachtas colleagues for their strong support for and engagement with today's meeting.

I will make observations rather than ask questions because we have a problem today: we will not be able to take the flesh off the bones of the important questions that people ask and that need further interrogation.<\/p> <p>  Several people spoke of getting a break or being lucky.  Mr. Moran said East Coast FM gave him a break, Jessica said Liadh N&iacute; Riada gave her a break, Mr. Alford said Inclusion Ireland gave him a break.  People talk about feeling lucky.  It is luck not systems.  As members of the committee we are dealing with three systems which are part of our public system but they are not working for the witnesses.  I was also struck that while they spoke about themselves they could not resist speaking about other people with disabilities.  Mr. Moran spoke about his friend trying to get into further education, Senator Ruane has referred to that.  There is a bank of supports at third level and it is untamed world when it comes to further education.  Colleagues have picked up on that today.  <\/p> <p>  Two points struck me today, one is this new way of listening to people.  In absolute nasty contrast, people with disabilities have been protesting inside the Polish Parliament since 18 April and their Government is treating them horrendously.  We have things to put right in this country but people with disabilities are in here as citizens - let us see more of them in here at this and other committees.  The people in Poland are looking for a decent few bob to get from week to week.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Loughlin said she has fought the good fight and now it is for Ireland to ratify the convention and fight the good fight.

Deputy O'Loughlin asked me what I am paying out since I lost the medical card.  I did a quick calculation and I am probably handing out between 10% and 15% of my monthly income, at least.  That is not a cost that someone without a disability has.  It is purely linked to my disability.  There might be other costs that I have not factored in but those are directly related to it.<\/p> <p>  What Deputy Brady said about barriers to employment put up by the system is very true but there is also an attitudinal barrier among some employers.  I am not sure whether it is the place of the State to do so but someone needs to address that.  When people see a person with a cane or crutches, they presume that they might not be up to much.  The attitude does exist although it is definitely waning.<\/p> <p>  I failed to mention that when my supports were halved and I was home-schooled, my parents paid for grinds.  That cost was imposed on my family because of my disability and for no other reason.  I did not have a special needs assistant for one of my subjects and I had to do that subject exclusively at home with two sets of two-hour grinds per week, which was quite expensive.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony mentioned the fear of losing supports.  I am not sure about the other people here but I was well aware that I would lose supports by going for and getting this job.  I had reached the point in my life that I was so disheartened from constantly applying and having to put the confidence on when I knew people were not interested once they saw the cane that I did not care about losing supports.

When I was in London in 2012, four people were in Leinster House because there was a danger of the disability allowance and services being changed while we were competing over there.  Bringing in the optional protocol would provide people with disabilities with a greater input into society.  In my experience working in media, not only am I qualified to do it, but I must prove physically that I can do a piece to camera or record a live piece for radio.  It is not a question of being qualified, the question is asked whether if one is disabled one can do it.

I remind colleagues that officials from the three Departments will come before the committee in a couple of weeks.  If there are specific or significant issues raised today or at the previous meeting which members want officials to address, I ask them to forward them to us in advance.  This is not to try and catch anybody out.  We will try to ensure the officials address the points raised at the meeting.<\/p><p>I thank our witnesses, Padraic, Eileen, Gary, Jessica, Paul and Dina, and their families, friends and work colleagues for attending today.  The witnesses are well able to talk.  Their presentations were very frank, honest and insightful.  We are compiling a report on this issue in which we will be making recommendations to the various Departments.  We are not claiming that in coming together we can address everything but we will try to address some of the specific issues raised, some of which are very obvious.  We will make recommendations and the witnesses will have played a key role in this regard.<\/p><p> On my own behalf and on behalf of the three joint committees, I thank all of the witnesses for taking the time to attend today and for the manner in which they presented.
