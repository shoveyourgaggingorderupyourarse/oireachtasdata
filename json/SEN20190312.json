In accordance with the Education Act, the terms and conditions of employment of SNAs employed in approved posts funded by moneys provided by the Oireachtas are determined by the Minister for Education and Skills, with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities who have additional and significant care needs in an educational context.  They may be appointed to a special school or a mainstream school to assist school authorities in making suitable provision for a pupil or pupils with special care needs.  The first priority is that the care needs of the pupils are met on an ongoing basis during the school year.<\/p><p>Circular 0017\/2013, published by the Department, deals with the maternity protection entitlements, including provision for breastfeeding, for SNAs in recognised primary and post-primary schools.  Paragraph 14.1 of Circular 0017\/2013 states:<\/p><blockquote>Within a twenty six week period after the birth of the child, a special needs assistant who has returned to work is entitled to one hour per day for the purpose of breastfeeding.  The time off, without loss of pay, may be taken as follows:<br \/><br \/>(a) one break of 60 minutes, or<br \/><br \/>(b) two breaks of 30 minutes each, or<br \/><br \/>(c) three breaks of 20 minutes each<\/blockquote> <p>The entitlements as contained in paragraph 14.1 of Circular 0017\/2013 are in accordance with the Maternity Protection (Protection of Mothers who are Breastfeeding) Regulations 2004.  Following consultation with school and staff representatives, the Department published Circular 0060\/2018, which amended the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks for teachers so that the breaks could be taken for a two-year period after the birth of the child.  The Department was contacted by representatives of SNAs following publication of this circular to request that a similar extension of breastfeeding breaks would be applied to SNAs.  Initial consultation with stakeholders, including management bodies, has raised a number of issues which require further consideration.  The primary concern is the provision of continued support to pupils with additional care and support requirements and the scheduling of any breaks must be cognisant of this overarching issue.  Any changes to the current arrangement must take into account the requirement to fulfil the additional care needs of pupils without a break in provision.  The extension of these provisions to SNAs is currently under consideration and will require further consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#H00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  Unfortunately, it is the same answer again, which is that the issue as to whether SNAs will get the same entitlements as do teachers under Circular 0060\/2018 is under consideration.  This is a question of equality.  Teachers are recruited to provide educational resources for the children in the school and so are SNAs.  The least we can do is to ensure that SNAs are treated in the same way in our educational system as are teachers.  I find the answer unsatisfactory.  The long-term health and emotional benefits for breastfeeding are well established and women's health issues should be given committed attention within the workplace.  The focus needs to be on promoting breastfeeding.  The Department of Education and Skills is falling down on this.

The Government has laid out an assisted human reproduction Bill but has not yet put it before this House or the D&aacute;il.  One in four couples in Ireland struggles with infertility and just after Christmas, the Government put aside a small fund of &euro;1 million, which is a pittance in the scheme of things, to help couples who are in need of financial support on their fertility journey.  As fertility treatment is a very costly process, the Government should bring forward the Bill and the Seanad is a good place to do so.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il would be delighted to support it and call for a debate on the matter.  Dearbhail McDonald outlined her own personal journey.  She said that not only does it affect people personally but it also has a societal impact whereby one has an aged society.  She commented that in Japan, there are more adults in nappies than there are children.  Fertility is something of which we all should be aware.  Many women in their 20s and 30s are blissfully unaware of their declining fertility.  A simple anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone, AMH, test or an antral follicle test can shed a lot of light on a woman's prospects for fertility at a later age.  Whether or not the Bill is put forward, there should be a debate in this House on fertility and assisted human reproduction.<\/p><p>Last night, I attended a meeting of a community-led subgroup of a drugs task force for the whole of Dublin South-Central, from the canals to Crumlin.  It was agreed anecdotally by many people who work in this area that there has been a citywide increase in the use of crack cocaine because it is cheaper and widely available.  In Dublin South-Central alone, the Crumlin area has gone through eight Garda superintendents in the past three years.  At present, no Garda superintendent has been appointed to oversee the Crumlin area.  When will a Garda superintendent be appointed for the Crumlin area because there is a lacuna at the moment?  Moreover, there are only seven youth workers for the Crumlin area when previously, there were as many as 20.  <\/p><p>First, we seem to not invest in inner-city areas, which are the most deprived and need the most help.  Second, we only react when there is an absolute crisis.  We need to invest in our youth at the early stages.  We need to ensure there are proper facilities, amenities and Garda resourcing.  In addition, the cuts to community drugs task forces and community sector must be reversed.  <\/p><p>There is a new phenomenon in Dublin, of which many people are aware, whereby gangs are arranging to meet online using Snapchat and other social media.  Such activity is very hard to police but the Garda can tackle it if it is given the resources and there is a will to do so.  Recently, 150 youths gathered in Dolphin's Barn and a few youths were assaulted there, about which the Garda said it could do nothing.  Two years ago, however, there was a similar issue in another part of Dublin where the Garda examined CCTV footage after the event.  As a result the Garda discovered who some of the youths were and actually went to their homes.  We need to resource the Garda and ensure there is proper community policing.  Most importantly, the Government should appoint a Garda superintendent for the Crumlin area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#N00700","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>When will the Government recognise there is more to Irish politics than political parties?

What about the fine Independent women who represent their local communities throughout the country?  If this Government was serious about wanting women in politics, they would provide cr&egrave;che facilities in local council areas and incentives for women to participate at reasonable hours of the day, not late into the night.  They would provide incentives for women who are post maternity or post delivering a child where they would have additional supports to allow them to continue on.

It is no longer seen as a career but a stepping stone to one.  This is to the detriment of the Defence Forces.  If one allies it to the current initiative by the Minister of State to undertake continuous recruitment, we must ask where are we going.  Do we not understand the only way to solve the problem in the Defence Forces is through retention?  If we continue on this route, we will finish up with the Defence Forces - the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps - being staffed by very senior officers and NCOs and very junior officers, private soldiers, airmen and sailors.  Those in the experienced middle ranks will have dissipated and left the Defence Forces forever.  This week the Defence Forces have called out yet again on the issue of bomb disposal duties.  We have to change the mood music in that regard and start to attract people to stay.  The only way to do this is by giving them a living wage, something we are not doing.  The Leader will refer me to the Public Service Pay Commission which is analysing salary entitlements in the Defence Forces, but we have to keep this issue on the agenda or there will be no one left in the Defence Forces at the rate things are going.

We are losing 80 officers a year, while enlisted men and women who have completed an apprenticeship in the Defence Forces are buying themselves out at a cost of up to &euro;40,000.

It is astounding to learn that the British Prime Minister never sought agreement or consulted the UK Attorney General before she went to the European Union for the latest round of attempts to secure agreement.  We need to be very mindful that there will be no good Brexit for the island of Ireland and that the people of the North voted against it.  They do not want it.  Therefore, we must ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland and no undermining of the Good Friday Agreement.  That has been our bottom line from day one.  It is what Sinn F&eacute;in has sought to achieve.  The backstop, as contained in the withdrawal agreement, is the only way to legally guarantee that outcome.

In the primary care centre in Castlebar there is only 0.06 of a physiotherapist, whatever that is supposed to mean.  There are no psychologists in the centre in Ballinrobe.

I had a rush-hour trip through the city centre in a taxi the other day and while I looked through the window I noticed many large buildings for student accommodation across the city.  I am not against student accommodation as it is needed and it is very important.  However, it seems strange that student accommodation, hotels and offices are the focus of the construction industry in our capital city while social and affordable housing, or any large-scale accommodation, is not being built.  One can go back to the crash for the causes of this but the Government's policies can and do affect the pattern of the construction industry's activities.  The time has come to take a look at why some buildings are being built and others are not.  It cannot be to do with the overall state of the economy and must be to do with factors which are within our capacity to affect and to vary.<\/p> <p>In the aftermath of the death of the Hawe family, in circumstances with which we are all acquainted, the question has arisen as to whether our succession law needs to be changed.

That is perfectly good and sensible law, although it may have to be varied in light of recent events on the north side of Dublin, which I will not go into any further.<\/p> <p>As things stand, the last man standing ends up being the next of kin.  If that person is deceased, the question of whether or not he or she is unworthy to succeed is not taken into account.  When one looks for next of kin or related people, one goes through a person who may have been the perpetrator of an offence and our law needs to be changed in those circumstances.

While there is an issue with lairage, if exporters can work together, we can sort out these issues.  There are 14 or 15 independent operators and the knock-on effect is that they will continue to make their profit margin.  There is no exporter not making money.

As we will have the debate later in the day, I would rather not add to that.  I will just say that the advice of the UK Attorney General has been noted by everybody.  He said that the legal risk remained but that what was agreed last night was an improvement.  I hope our colleagues in Westminster will have the political courage to accept the deal to ensure we will not have a hard Brexit and that we will not have a hard border on this island.  I certainly hope that can take place today.  I am also cognisant that the withdrawal agreement has not been rewritten and that the backstop remains, albeit temporarily.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised last night's programme on fertility.  I commend Dearbhail McDonald on her bravery, courage and honesty in speaking on the issue.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to debate the matter post the break.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On the issue of Garda resources, this Government reopened Templemore and increased resources to the Garda.  Unfortunately, or fortunately if one prefers, the operational matter of the allocation of superintendents and chief superintendents is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, and the Crumlin Garda area is not a matter for me or the House to discuss.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the payment offer by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.  The information I have for my learned friend and colleague is that the Minister of State has asked that the scheme be open to all candidates so they can avail of it.  On the point the Senator made in regard to the Defence Forces, we had the debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, in the past couple of weeks and we will have him back in the House soon.  It is important that we recognise the importance of the work the members of the Defence Forces perform.  We can sometimes get into a spiral of talking down our Defence Forces.  Senator Craughwell pre-empted some of my reply to him.  To be fair to him and Senator McFadden, who have repeatedly raised the matter in the House, the number of personnel in the Defence Forces stands at 94% of its planned strength, notwithstanding the issue of pay.  I fully accept the point made by Senator Craughwell that there is a need to do more for the Defence Forces, and the Public Sector Pay Commission is sitting to deal with this.  The number of personnel on family income supplement is approximately 1% of the Defence Forces strength, or 90 people, although I accept it is 90 too many.  We must work to ensure the strength of the Defence Fores is maintained and, equally, that there is promotion and retention and people see the unique and demanding positions they fill are ones in which there can be a lifelong career.  I will be happy to bring the Minister of State back to the House regarding the matter raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#V00400","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>In order that the record is not false or misleading, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>published the figures last week.

We need to ensure there is pay restoration and pay reward for members of our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of primary care.  She is right that there is a need to conclude the talks between GPs and the Department of Health on the new GP scheme.  We need doctors as part of primary care provision.  This Government, as the Senator knows well, is committed to developing primary care models and the primary care service as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which is an all-party document.  The important point is that funding for primary care has been increased by &euro;50 million in 2019, which means additional resourcing will be available to deliver on the need for primary care facilities.  I do not have the figures or the information regarding the facilities in Mayo to which the Senator referred but I would be happy to talk to her about that later.  Perhaps a Commencement matter would be a way to get a more expeditious answer.<\/p> <p>Senators Humphreys and Horkan raised the important issue of safety in apartments and houses post Priory Hall.  Senator Humphreys is right that it is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I have put in a request to the Minister, Deputy Murphy, to come to the House, although I have not had the opportunity to finalise the date.  It is a distressing situation and families should not be in that position.  I raised the point the last day in the context that while a blank cheque is not available, it is about finding a solution.  The Government has made strides in different legislation and building codes.  Senator Horkan made a point about the building regulator.  We will not go back to Priory Hall and the anomalies that existed under his party's watch in government.  The important point is that we cannot compromise on health and safety or building standards, nor should we.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House in regard to the matters raised.<\/p> <p>Senator Horkan also raised the important issue of airline safety, especially in regard to the Boeing 737 MAX aeroplane.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are experts in the field, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, in the United States, which has said that it can continue to be used, but I am concerned that we are compromising on safety in our aircraft.  I hope the fleet will be more regularly inspected and monitored than hitherto.  It is important to ensure there are high standards and that the safety of passengers and crew is uppermost in what we do, rather than just turning aircraft around and making profits.  The point the Senator made is relevant.  On the issue he raised regarding the building regulator, I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell raised housing and student accommodation.  We all welcome the construction of student accommodation.  It was a failure of the planning system that when many third level institutions were expanded, the provision of student accommodation in tandem with that was not included.  The Government is aware of the ongoing challenges in the housing sector and, despite the headlines, it is making progress.  Under Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is committed to building both social and private housing.  Some 14,500 new homes were built in 2017, an increase of 50%.  The budget for 2019 is &euro;2.4 billion to support 27,000 housing support units, the creation of 10,000 new homes and taking people out of homelessness.  It is a challenge we must get right and we are committed to doing that.<\/p><p>The succession issue which the Senator raised arising from the Hawe case requires a response from the Government.  Between dealing with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, the Judicial Council Bill and other legislative measures in the justice area, I will invite the Minister to discuss that.  The Senator made an important point regarding succession and, therefore, I am happy to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>Senators Lombard and Mulherin raised the important issue of our beef industry and the depressed cattle prices.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, was away last week working on opening new markets.  I will invite him to the House after the St. Patrick's Day parade and the St. Patrick's Day trips across the world.  I take this opportunity to wish all those who are travelling abroad, including you, a Chathaoirligh, every success with their missions.  It is about selling and promoting Ireland, in the post-Brexit era, as a country with a modern business community that is very much open for business.  I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and all the Ministers well in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#W00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#X00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of the far right.

The ongoing uncertainty we are facing only serves to increase the scale of this challenge as we prepare for several possible outcomes.  The potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland would be severe.  Negative impacts would be felt across a range of sectors of the economy, across our regions and by our consumers, farmers and fishermen.  Our preparations, including through our legislative proposals, are focused on minimising these impacts.  Our focus remains on ratifying the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, that has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom because this remains the best way to ensure an orderly British exit.  It would also allow us to move on to start work on the agreement that will frame our future relationship.  The withdrawal agreement gets us to that next phase in the best way possible.<\/p> <p>Managing a no-deal Brexit would be an exercise in damage limitation.  It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across the range of sectors which are, at the moment, facilitated by our common EU membership.  Comprehensive, cross-government preparations were set out in the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan which was published on 19 December.  This work continues on a daily basis at both national and EU levels.  All Departments have sector-specific plans in place.  These address key challenges arising from a no-deal Brexit and associated mitigation efforts.  They include a range of measures such as the recruitment of customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, officials, preparations at our ports and airports and a range of financial and advisory supports for businesses to help them to prepare for Brexit.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Our work at national level goes in tandem with the significant work under way across the EU to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s possible departure without a deal on the 29 March.  A no-deal scenario would be a lose-lose-lose scenario for the people of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the EU.  The only place that can prevent this from happening is Westminster.  In the context of tonight&rsquo;s vote in Westminster, the outcome of last night's meeting in Strasbourg between President Juncker and Prime Minister May was very positive.  It is our hope that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons.  Although we are seeing how things are progressing, it is still our hope that it will be endorsed by the House of Commons.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has insisted that the withdrawal agreement could not be rewritten and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border.  We have, however, always said that we were willing to offer guarantees and further assurances to the UK.  We have offered such assurances on a number of occasions.  The instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement from both parties of what has been agreed.  It does not reopen the withdrawal agreement.  It does not undermine the backstop or its application.  It says that we will work together in good faith in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures the objectives of the protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met.<br\/><br\/>Brexit will bring real changes for all of us.  The Government has been working hard to ensure that Ireland is ready for the changes and challenges that Brexit brings.  We continue to seek to mitigate, as far as possible, these impacts.  With the impending approach of the Brexit deadline, we have had no choice in recent weeks but to ramp up our no-deal preparations, including bringing legislation before the Oireachtas.  When the Government published the no-deal Brexit legislation on 22 February, the T&aacute;naiste said he hoped that it would do no more than sit on the shelf of his office.  That was and is my firm hope as well.  That said, given the ongoing uncertainty we need to have this legislation in place.<br\/><br\/>The enactment of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 has been given the highest priority by the Government and Oireachtas.  The co-operation of all sides in the Oireachtas to work together to ensure that this legislation is in place before 29 March is very much appreciated, and clearly demonstrates the unity of purpose in our Parliament in our approach to Brexit.  The Bill completed all stages in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday 6 March following good and substantive discussions of all Parts.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the co-operation of the Seanad in taking all Stages of the Bill this week.  This will, undoubtedly, ensure that there is sufficient time for presidential signature and other commencement measures, as well as enabling us to put in place the necessary statutory instruments envisaged by the legislation.<br\/><br\/>The Bill covers in primary legislation the issues that need to be addressed immediately in the event of a no-deal scenario, ensuring that key measures and protections are in place.  It focuses on protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors that would be affected.<br\/><br\/>The Bill forms part of the extensive preparations that are under way across Government and across the EU.  At EU level, 12 separate legislative proposals have been made as part of Brexit contingency preparations.  They range from aviation connectivity to road freight connectivity and from dual-use goods to fishing authorisations.  Ireland has engaged on the detail of what is proposed at EU level on contingency to ensure that our concerns are reflected in the proposals being taken forward.<br\/><br\/>Given the emergency nature of this legislation, the Government took the decision that progressing this through the Houses as an omnibus Bill was the most practical and sensible way to ensure that we have the necessary legislation enacted before 29 March or before that.  The Bill contains 15 parts, addressing issues which require immediate primary legislation in a no-deal scenario.  These have been identified following a detailed screening by all Departments of legislation currently in force.  A range of issues will also be addressed by statutory instrument before 29 March.  This work on statutory legislation is being taken forward by all Departments and co-ordinated by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade.<br\/><br\/>While the Bill is primarily about preparations for a no-deal Brexit one measure, Part 15, deals with a time-sensitive issue that would arise should the withdrawal agreement be ratified.  The Bill will make provision in domestic law for a transition period during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK, even though it will be formally a third country.  This transition period effectively maintains the <i>status quo<\/i>up to December 2020.  It will allow for the negotiation of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, and provide certainty to citizens and business, as we continue our preparations for the new relationship with UK outside the EU.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The remainder of the Bill covers the areas in legislation that require immediate change in a no-deal scenario.  Protecting and maintaining the common travel area, CTA, and the associated rights and privileges is a key part of our planning and preparations.  This is vital in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process, as well as for broader lreland-UK relations.  The Bill, therefore, includes measures to underpin the CTA to ensure that the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this longstanding arrangement will continue in any circumstance.  In the area of health services, the Bill provides continuity for a range of existing healthcare arrangements between Ireland and the UK, once the UK leaves the EU.  The Minister for Health will be provided with the power to make regulations in a number of matters, including to enable persons from Ireland to access healthcare in the UK.  This seeks to ensure that insofar as possible there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island, and Ireland-UK basis.  In the area of social protection, the Bill provides for the continued payment of a range of benefits, including old age pensions, illness benefits and child benefit.  It ensures the recognition of contributions made when working in the UK, and access to social insurance payments.  It is important that we ensure a seamless transition and existing payments are protected and maintained.  The Bill also provides protection for workers whose UK-based employer becomes insolvent.<\/p><p>In the area of higher education, the Bill protects the continued mobility of students under the common travel area.  It will allow for the student universal support Ireland, SUSI, grants to be paid to eligible Irish students studying in the UK, as well as to UK students in Irish higher education institutions.  This provides certainty for Irish students studying, or considering studying, in the UK, and for UK students in Ireland.  These measures protect and enhance the longstanding excellent co-operation and collaboration between higher education systems in Ireland and the UK.  Having taken on board a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment in the D&aacute;il this Part of the Bill also now facilitates the continuation of the free fees initiative for third level students.  It does this by ensuring that periods of UK residency and being a UK citizen count for eligibility for a student accessing the initiative.  The Government is determined to maintain the strong co-operation with the UK in the area of law enforcement, particularly regarding Northern Ireland.  The Bill includes provisions to ensure that justice and security co-operation with the UK, as a third country, can continue.  It puts in place measures to apply the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition to the UK.  This will ensure workable extradition arrangements are in place between ourselves and the UK.  It also makes amendments to the Immigration Acts, which might otherwise expose the State to the risk that removals would be unsuccessful and undermine existing arrangements.<\/p><p>From the outset, the Government has made it a priority to minimise the impact of Brexit on North-South co-operation, and the all-island economy.  The Bill addresses sectors where major challenges associated with a no-deal Brexit have been identified, including all-island transport, and energy.  Provisions in transport will, on a precautionary basis, where other international measures are not agreed, protect cross-Border bus services, ensuring continued service provision for passengers and commuters on the island of Ireland.  This covers compatibility with EU rules that govern services between a member state and a third country.  The Bill enables the energy regulator to address possible issues arising from a no-deal Brexit, to maintain the operation of the single electricity market.  Amendments to this part were agreed in the D&aacute;il providing a basis for re-certification of companies and individuals working in the F-Gas sector in circumstances where the UK leaves with no deal on 29 March.  The Bill also covers tax measures that seek to minimise the disruption to business operating cross-Border in the immediate aftermath of a no-deal Brexit.  On the capital acquisition tax, CAT, the Bill provides continuity in existing treatment that landowners who operate cross-Border will not be disadvantaged.  On corporation tax, the Bill maintains current practice for tax treatment of certain transaction or corporate group structures.  The part on taxation also now includes a number of measures relating to excise and the value added tax, VAT, retail export scheme.  In practice, these measures give the Minister for Finance discretion to take a number of steps to control and minimise the scope for abuse of the VAT retail export scheme.  In respect of duty free, the proposed measure is also a precautionary one that will be subject to activation by commencement order.<\/p><p>The Government and the Commission have paid particular attention to the impact of Brexit on Irish business in its contingency planning.  Businesses and other affected areas need to respond and prepare themselves, and the Government is providing an array of supports and information measures to assist them.  The Bill will now give Enterprise Ireland additional enabling power to further support businesses through widened investment, loans and research, development and innovation grants.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is to further assist Irish businesses in remaining competitive and resilient in a no-deal Brexit context.  This will maximise our capacity to support business in the face of what could be a difficult transition.  The Bill also provides for continuity for financial services while the Irish market transitions to a new central securities depository provider.  Other measures provide for a temporary run-off regime to protect Irish policy holders from continuity issues with their insurance contracts in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  The Bill includes provisions to introduce postponed accounting for VAT purposes in a no-deal scenario.  This will alleviate the impact of a potential cash flow burden faced by businesses post Brexit.  This is a practical measure which will support business.  It was an issue highlighted by many involved in the industry.<\/p><p>The Government is determined to ensure Britain and Ireland will build and maintain their strong and special relationship.  We are working together to develop that relationship and build new structures to do so, even as the debate on Brexit continues today at Westminster.  As the Taoiseach said this morning, we should give MPs time and space to consider what is on the table.  However, I again say Ireland&rsquo;s future is in the European Union.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I am determined, with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and all of our colleagues, to build and develop Ireland&rsquo;s future as an active and committed member of the European Union, the Single Market and the customs union.  There is no greater demonstration of the benefits of EU membership for a country like Ireland than in the unity and solidarity shown by our EU partners in the face of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#Y02200","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Bravo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#BB00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>There is an old Chinese saying or blessing, \"May you live in interesting times.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#BB00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>It is a curse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#BB00500","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>We are certainly living in interesting political times, but they are also confusing and ever-changing.

In respect of the entire body politic in this country, when the history books on this period are written - I am sure there will be loads of them - it will be found that the conduct of these Houses was exemplary across the board, in stark contrast to the mayhem in the mother of parliaments where those involved have let themselves down so often, but we will not comment further.<\/p> <p>Last week I expressed my disappointment - I am voicing it again today - at the comment made by the Taoiseach.  Admittedly, he was speaking to the party faithful at a convention.  Therefore, we will allow a little licence.  However, he said he did not believe my party was wholehearted in its support for the approach taken to Brexit.  Nothing could be further from the truth and it bears repeating.  My party has a proud history so far as the European Union is concerned.  It was Jack Lynch and Paddy Hillery who signed us up, with Fine Gael, at a time when other parties represented in the House were vehemently opposed to Ireland joining the European Union, but they have now realised their mistake and are very anxious that we stay in it and that there is a good Brexit.<\/p> <p>My party is disappointed that there will be so few sitting days before 29 March.  As a consequence, we will not have as much time to scrutinise or analyse the Bill as we would wish.  Other countries, including France and Netherlands, published their Brexit legislation months ago.  We are behind the curve in planning for it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Fianna F&aacute;il intends to do all it can to facilitate the passage of the Bill through the House, having been passed expeditiously by the D&aacute;il.  We want to ensure this emergency legislation will be in place, should we require it.  This morning I half thought that this debate would be entirely academic, that we would just have to go through the motions and pass the Bill, but it is now vitally important that it be passed because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.<br\/><br\/>The omnibus Bill is made up of 15 Parts which deal with matters within the remit of nine Ministers.  Each part will be commenced by the individual Minister responsible at the appropriate time.  My colleagues in the Seanad will take turns in the next few days to deal with matters in their areas, while my job is to look at the macro side.  I will also conclude the debate at the end of the week.  It is clear from the Bill that the industries and sectors most opposed to Brexit will need additional support and financial aid.  Thousands of jobs are on the line and businesses and SMEs will need much greater support and assistance than the Government has offered to date.  The time for waiting to see what will happen has long passed; we must stop talking and start doing.  There is no room for complacency when it comes to safeguarding jobs.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il is acutely aware of the impact Brexit will have on the country and the entire island.  Given the uncertainty in the United Kingdom, it is in the national interest to provide stability and continue to facilitate the confidence and supply agreement.  Many other parties have acted irresponsibly by looking for a snap election and repeatedly tabling motions of no confidence.  They are entitled to do so, but that is the easy thing to do.  My party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, has given unerring direction and shown courage in that regard.  There are critics in our own ranks of the confidence and supply agreement, but any rational person knows that we would have been wrong and putting the party before the country if we had done anything else in the past couple of years, especially in the light of Brexit.  Politicians tend to do such a thing from time to time and my party has made mistakes in the past, but I am proud to say that in this case we have made no mistakes and that my party leader has made no mistakes in that regard.  He deserves a little more appreciation from the Taoiseach, rather than provocative and goading statements from time to time.<br\/><br\/>A no-deal Brexit would mean that on 29 March under EU law the status of the United Kingdom would change from being a member state to a third country, with no trade co-operation agreement in place.  The transition period, as provided for in the withdrawal agreement, would not apply, the United Kingdom would be outside the Single Market and the customs union and it would no longer be part of the framework of EU law known as the EU <i>acquis<\/i>.  Every effort must be made to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would cause severe economic harm to Ireland.  We hope there will be a no-deal Brexit.  I assume the Minister will have more up-to-date information than I have.

They are asking if it will ever end.  If there is to be an extension of the time limit, the period should be curtailed and based on positive proposals that could be looked at and worked on in the interim.

She has remained calm, cool, objective and persuasive at all times.  I agree with what has been said about her and add that her performances make one proud to be a Member of the Irish Parliament, compared with some other parliaments which I will not name.<\/p><p>Like everybody else in the House, I hope for a soft Brexit if there must be a Brexit.  I regard Brexit as a disaster which should never have happened.  Although one may look to the unity of the Tory Party through decades of hostile press treatment of the EU in Britain and to the cynicism with which a referendum was offered to the electorate as immediate causes for Brexit happening, it is a superficial understanding.  One of the reasons Brexit took place was that a small minority in Europe continued to press a case for federalism against the wishes and inclinations of the great majority of the people of Europe.  I recently noticed that the President of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron, stated he was now combating negative nationalism throughout Europe, and he called for an increase in integration as the antidote to disintegration.  It is not so simple, however, and he should ask himself why it was that the then French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the then Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi, stood on an aircraft carrier deck on the island of Ventotene, off the coast of Italy, while Mr. Renzi announced that he would use Italy's six-month Presidency of the Council of the European Union to pursue a United States of Europe.  These people must take responsibilty for the reactions they provoked.<\/p><p>The same applies to the German Chancellor, Ms Merkel, whose handling of the immigration and refugee crisis in the context of the Syrian civil war was a mistake and produced a reaction in vast swathes of central Europe.  The same also applies to those people who persist in pursuing the European super state, that is, the federal solution, when it is not a cause which carries the support of a majority in any member state of the European Union, all the way from Germany to Greece to Ireland.  This concept of Europe is producing a reaction.  What is wrong with Europe as it is?  Why must we constantly create this kind of false struggle between scepticism on the one hand and federalism on the other, when the great majority of the peoples of the European member states have a different vision of Europe in which it is a partnership of sovereign states which pool their sovereignty to some extent but retain it for other purposes?  This tragedy has been visited on us not merely by reactionary elements in Britain and by negative elements of British politics.  The counterbalance and necessary condition for that was the constant reference to an ever closer Union and to federalist proposals such as a European army and so on, which were anathema to the great majority of the British people.  Having said that, given that the British people have voted to leave the European Union in a referendum offered to them, if the British Parliament is determined to implement that referendum's outcome, it is in our clear interest that it should be as soft a Brexit as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That applies no matter what way one looks at the issue.  In that malign scenario, the deal which Prime Minister May has negotiated seems to be the best of a bad lot, which should attract our support.  In that sense, I wish her every good fortune in her parliamentary struggles but it is really the lesser of two evils and I believe that the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union is a disaster for many reasons, especially for this country.  Now we come to what is happening in Westminster today.  I share with the Minister, Senator Ned O'Sullivan and nearly everybody in this House the view that we should still hope that the worst will not happen and that a no-deal Brexit will not arise out of the parliamentary process in Westminster.  The obvious way to avoid a no-deal Brexit is to accept the deal that is on offer.  Listening to DUP spokesmen, however, especially to the contribution of Nigel Dodds in the House of Commons, it became clear to me that there is very little appetite for Prime Minister May's deal on those benches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#DD00100","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>They have said \"No\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#EE00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>They have said \"No\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#EE00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>They have said \"No\", so that is it.  Looking, as I did earlier, at the opinion given by the Attorney General, Mr. Cox, it became clear that this scenario was about to evolve.  This means that, on the face of it, although we can hope for the triumph of hope over experience, the realistic view is that she will lose the substantive motion and we will then go into the uncharted territory of hoping that there is a majority in the House of Commons for the rejection of a no-deal outcome, which I confidently believe is the case unless it is interfered with by partisan politics.  The cross-party view in Westminster is that there should not be a no-deal exit.<\/p> <p>If such a resolution is passed, one is then left with the question as to where the House of Commons goes to from there and what we can expect from that.  The obvious next step is to seek a postponement of Article 50 in some shape or form.  One thing we have to bear in mind was that Jean-Claude Juncker said yesterday, in the clearest possible terms, not to come back seeking an amendment or to renegotiate anything.  We face a serious situation.  If it is the European Union's position not to signal that further concessions are available to the European Research Group and the DUP, which I think is the correct position, we are depending on the emergence of a cross-party consensus within the House of Commons to reject a no-deal exit.  That is a precarious hope on which so many of our fortunes will depend.<\/p> <p>I support this Bill as a fire brigade measure, which is necessary.  I believed, like Senator Ned O'Sullivan, over the last few weeks that it would be a theoretical exercise.  It is now becoming far less theoretical and far more realistic that this legislation may be needed.  For there to be something in place before 29 March, I believe these Houses should co-operate with the Government in passing this legislation without further delay or complication.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept that it only addresses the immediate potential adverse consequences of a no-deal exit.  I am taking it on faith that the Government has done the minimal job necessary to protect us from major negative outcomes of a no-deal Brexit.  Further refining legislation may be required to deal with issues that simply have not been dealt with in this legislation, but I hope that is not the case.  If it is, we should give the Government the support it will need in introducing further legislation if it is absolutely necessary.<\/p><p>This is a sad day for Ireland and I am not making a point about Sinn F&eacute;in because it is pointless in doing so.  It is a sad day that no one is speaking in the halls of Westminster for the majority of people in Northern Ireland.  They deserve to have a voice and the people in the rest of the United Kingdom deserve to hear it in the clearest and strongest way possible.<\/p><p>I do not believe the members of the European Research Group, ERG, really care about Northern Ireland.  I do not believe their concern about the union is valid.  Even if there were differential treatment, for the purposes of the European Union, between the two parts of the United Kingdom - Northern Ireland and the island of Britain - I do not believe it would weaken the union.  However, I strongly believe the motivation of ERG members has been much more complex and slightly more devious than has been generally accepted.  They want the next best thing to a no-deal Brexit because they want to have a World Trade Organization or Canada-type scenario and know that the situation in Northern Ireland is an obstacle to it.<\/p><p>In their contributions in public Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Pattel have said Britain should be willing to use potential damage to this country as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  If we were to abandon the backstop and allow the next phase of negotiations to proceed, I have no doubt that that card would be played repeatedly to receive concessions, weaken the resolve of our partners in the European Union in the transition phase negotiations and put us in a progressively weaker position in upholding the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>I admire the Government's stance, of which I am totally supportive.  I particularly admire the Minister of State's personal contribution to the debate.  This House has shown itself to be conscientious and responsible.  We established our Brexit committee.  I commend Senator Richmond on his work as chairman of it.  We have done our best to try to be constructive, but the time is coming for us to be realistic.  On this occasion realism comes down to this.  It is unlikely that the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, will get her deal through.  It is possible that there will be a resolution in the House of Commons against a no-deal solution.  It is also possible that there will be a postponement of Article 50, but in view of the position taken by President Junker and the clear statement that effectively there is nothing further to be discussed in regard to the withdrawal agreement, we should not be under any illusion that it will be anything more than a mere postponement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should be very clear in our diplomacy and in what we say that those who are doing so much damage potentially to this island by attempting to bring about a no-deal solution should be identified and should take responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#EE00400","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>It is customary to welcome a Minister to the House but, for once, I am disappointed to see the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  That is nothing personal.  It is simply because while this legislation is necessary and while I welcome it, it is so utterly bad and disappointing that we have come to this stage that I struggle for once to welcome her.  I hope she does not take it personally.<\/p> <p>This is emergency legislation of the most base nature.  The fact we are even at this stage having to discuss it is a damning indictment of the British political system.  It is a reflection on the maturity of the Irish political system and the wider European political system that we are hoping for the best still, with less than 17 days or just over 400 hours to go.  I have gone from counting in days to hours.  However, unfortunately, we are in the position where we need to plan for the worst.  Let us be under no illusion that this emergency legislation is planning for the worst.  It is literally about keeping the trains running and keeping the lights on.  It is not something that is workable, that is a sunnier upland pasture or that I would ever like anyone to want as a policy direction.  Unfortunately, there are those who do want this as a policy direction but, thankfully, they are not in this Chamber.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact this legislation came through the D&aacute;il so swiftly.  I would like to address a few points raised by other speakers or which may be raised later.  I acknowledge some 30 amendments have been put down by Sinn F&eacute;in.  I will likely disagree with most of them based on their relevance at this stage or possibly with the policy thereafter, but we will have that discussion in a frank manner on Committee Stage, no doubt, or my colleagues will do so on a sectoral basis.  I hope we can move this legislation amendment-free or without contested amendments in order that we can get it in place as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>In terms of the timing, when the European Commission published its no-deal notification in December, it allowed the Government to produce this exhaustive piece of legislation on foot of the European recommendations but also on foot of what is needed.  When I say \"Government\" in this regard, I do not necessarily refer to the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach but rather to the officials and the diplomats who have worked so terribly hard and so thoroughly.<\/p> <p>I have to take issue with a number of the points made by Senator Ned O'Sullivan, although I do not know if he is making them personally.  When we look at the European comparisons and say the French and the Dutch have already completed this, in fact, not everything is the same.  We hear Fianna F&aacute;il say the Dutch have hired their customs officials but they have not because they are not at that point.  Continuing to say that and having the Fianna F&aacute;il finance spokesperson continue to say it, is grossly inappropriate and should be stopped.  We will have 429 customs officials in place by 29 March as needed, and a further 171 will come thereafter to allow for a total of 600.  We will have the veterinary officials in place.  The Dutch and the French have not published legislation in any detail that is comparable with this and they have allowed their European Ministers to act by decree.<\/p> <p>If the Senator would like to give the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, or the T&aacute;naiste those powers, I would welcome it.  However, I acknowledge that with 49 Deputies out of 158, that probably is not going to happen in the current D&aacute;il, let alone given the Seanad arithmetic.  We need to be accurate.  The Polish Government has not even produced its legislation yet and it is not available for public consumption.  I can go through every single member state, if Senator Ned O'Sullivan would like, and tell him exactly where the no-deal planning and preparation is for each one.  Regardless, we have to remember that the member states that will be most impacted by any kind of Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit, are Ireland and thereafter the Dutch, the Belgians and the Danes and perhaps the large economies of Germany and France.  However, it is completely inappropriate to compare the no-deal preparations of Estonia with Ireland.  It is unfair political point-scoring.  We talk about political point-scoring and Senator Ned O'Sullivan has rightly asked for-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#GG00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Senator Richmond is doing some of it himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#GG00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I am not necessarily saying it is pointless.

The person who really does not know what they are is Theresa May, nor do any members of her Government or any of the Members of Parliament in Westminster.  I could probably spend 45 minutes discussing what might happen later today or tomorrow, whether they will vote against a no-deal Brexit or if there will be an extension.  Ultimately, however, our responsibility is to this island, to pass this legislation and to continue our ratification process.<\/p> <p>I believe EU reform is needed but the Senator and I have a difference of opinion on where the EU should go, and we have shared many platforms.  Ultimately, the EU must reform to stop the next exit of one of the other 27 member states.  That might just be a reform of communication skills or starting to reach out more to the populace.  I hope this legislation will not be needed and is not enacted, that it simply sits in a drawer in a desk until the last minute and is not necessary.  We would love to have more time but I believe it was delayed deliberately to allow the preparation and the process to continue as well as possible.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell rightly spoke about the focus on no deal and the desires of the ERG.  I agree.  I do not believe the ERG acts in the interests of Northern Ireland or of the peace on this island, but I do not believe the DUP acts that way either.  When one looks at the DUP's record in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and some of the contributions made by its spokespersons either in the Houses of Parliament or on broadcast media, particularly in this jurisdiction, one must question what it wants for the people of this island, North and South, post Brexit.  What does it want for the farmers who will not be able to get goods to the market or the business people who will not be able to trade with the rest of the world, let alone their nearest neighbour, or the people who will be unable to feed their families and will face the absolute deprivation that a no-deal scenario will offer the ordinary people of this island and of Great Britain?  Be under no illusion about the absolute charlatans who push for no deal, the disaster capitalists on the fringe of a certain fringe element of certain political parties in the United Kingdom.  I question whether they care for anybody at all.  We are faced with a nefarious element in Westminster that is pushing something that is unfathomable for this island and for its own, and that is why we are in this position.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, we must pass extremely regrettable legislation.  We can hope it does not come into force but we must pass it.  We need the support of this House, as we had the support of the D&aacute;il.  Let us get it through in time and let us see what comes next out of London.  However, we should be under no illusion.  There are no negotiations.  They ended in November and this Government and the Oireachtas are trying to do the best for this island, and will continue to do so.  The best situation, of course, is that there is no Brexit, but we have no control over that.  The next best is to make sure we get a withdrawal agreement to allow a managed Brexit.  There is no such thing as a managed no deal; it is merely a form of words.  A no-deal scenario is like removing the roof from a house and replacing it with a sheet of paper.  That is where we are.<\/p> <p>The situation is not of our making and is not our decision, but we can do our best to prepare for it.  Ultimately, no country in the EU will be able to prepare fully for a no-deal Brexit but we are making the best effort to prepare in the best way possible.  I have no doubt that if a no-deal Brexit were to occur, further legislation and actions will be required but those discussions are for another day.  I sincerely hope we are never obliged to have those discussions.  Unfortunately, in the 419 hours to go to Brexit, we must act prudently for this island and the Union.  I have become something of a late-night addict to BBC Parliament.  I wish I did not have to watch it as much as I do, but that is where we are.<\/p> <p>I commend this Bill to the House and I commend the Minister of State's statement.

I know that she acknowledges, understands and appreciates this better than most.  I wish her and the Government well in the eleventh hour work that must be done in the next while because it is of such crucial national importance and will have an impact on every facet and aspect of Irish life.  There is no corner of this island that will not be touched negatively as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union.  As has been touched on, in typical and, as some would say, predictable fashion, this afternoon the DUP has stated \"No\".  While not entirely surprising, what should give the Minister of State and her Government colleagues strength and focus is the fact that Ulster has not said \"No\".  A majority of people in the North voted to remain and, according to all of the latest opinion polls which I am sure the Government has studied carefully, their support for remaining in the European Union has not just stayed the same but actually increased.  They do not want this reckless Brexit inflicted on the North against the will of its people.  As others have acknowledged, none of us wants to be here and I am sure that includes the Minister of State.  None of us wants to have to deal with this legislation, but it is work of last resort.  We are where we are in that regard.  <\/p><p>On amendments to the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in has sought to amend it with sincerity, in good faith and the spirit of co-operation we have all brought to this issue in the past two years.  As everyone here acknowledges, the withdrawal agreement must be legally sound and binding.  It must remain unaltered.  The backstop - the bare minimum insurance policy - must also remain unchanged and uncompromised.  It is our view that last night's events have not changed the legal position on the withdrawal agreement, as endorsed by the Oireachtas in November.  Our ultimate backstop is the Good Friday Agreement.  We must forever be alert to the further jeopardy Brexit and the actions of the British Parliament might inflict on the agreement which must be protected in all of its parts.  <\/p><p>This is a time of great and deep uncertainty.  People are very concerned.  I am concerned, not just as a politician and someone who is privileged to serve in this House but also as a cross-Border worker.  I am concerned as an Irish citizen who will, like hundreds of thousands of others, be trapped in a post-Brexit scenario against our will.  I note the Minister of State's remarks about the common travel area and rights in that regard continuing to be upheld.  However, we must acknowledge, even before Brexit, that Irish citizens in the North are being taken to court by the British Home Office by dint of their asserting their right under the Good Friday Agreement to be Irish.  With the greatest of respect and full awareness of the importance of tempering our remarks, we need to get real on the citizenship issue.  That is why some of the proposed Committee Stage amendments are of such crucial importance in asserting, fulfilling and living up to our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  To those who claim the British Government is serious about upholding the Good Friday Agreement in a post-Brexit scenario, I suggest it is not upholding it now as Irish citizens are being taken to court by the British Home Office for merely wanting to exercise the democratic right afforded to them under the agreement.  <\/p><p>I will not prolong this process as we must get this legislation passed in these Houses.  While I accept that there will be differences of opinion on our amendments, Sinn F&eacute;in will work collaboratively, in the best interests of the Irish people, North and South, with Government colleagues and colleagues in all parties and none in this House.  I accept Senator McDowell's word when he says he was not having a go at Sinn F&eacute;in.  I believe him when he says that.  However, it is worth stating ever increasing numbers of people are turning away from Westminster and looking to institutions on this island and in Brussels because they accept that Westminster, as has been proved, is not serving their interests.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Westminster is not working for their betterment, their well-being or their welfare.

The North has just been denied two European Parliament seats, so we have lost that voice also.  We do not have the ability to have our MPs speaking in these Houses, which is another opportunity lost to us.  Citizens are deeply concerned, which we discovered last week when the Brexit committee visited Belfast.

I do not believe that any of us can say we welcome the legislation to the House, despite its obvious importance.  We are in a remarkable and unusual situation where there is a high degree of support in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad for a Bill that none of us ever wants to see enacted.  We are dealing with emergency legislation that aims to protect, to a certain extent, against the worst effects of a hard Brexit.  We are trying to maintain seamless co-operation in case the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, the T&aacute;naiste and the officials who have worked so hard to produce the Bill before us today.  I truly hope it will never be enacted.  That is just the way it is.  It is a strange time to be debating this Bill, given that all eyes today are on Westminster and how the UK Parliament will vote this evening.  We are, as we have been for many months, ultimately waiting to see what the UK will do.  We have worked for two years to put a deal on the table that can avoid a hard border in Ireland, but despite the best efforts over the past few days, it is hard to be optimistic about tonight's events.<\/p><p>We are trying to balance the need for a legally-binding backstop with assurances to the UK over its concerns on the length and content of the backstop.  The advice from the UK's Attorney General today, and the reaction of many MPs, seem to suggest that it may not be enough.  In an almost impossible situation, it seems that constructive ambiguity over the legal character of the backstop may only go so far.  The core substance of the insurance policy to prevent a hard border on this island remains the same, and rightly so.  It is essential for peace and prosperity.<\/p><p>On whether this Bill will need to be enacted, it also seems possible that if the deal is not agreed tonight, the UK may seek an extension to buy more time.  This seems preferable to a devastating no-deal Brexit on 29 March but I am not convinced about what can change with an extension, apart from us repeating this process in two or three months&rsquo; time.  The Bill is trying to prepare for such a scenario and to maintain seamless co-operation as much as possible.  The sad reality is that current arrangements have allowed for this co-operation and the UK is very close to walking away from it.<\/p><p>The Brexiteer extremists who led this process did not care one bit about the North and their efforts in recent months have only reinforced that.  It barely registered in the campaign as they fought for an exit from the EU at all costs, and they seem happy to play with peace on this island.  It is truly shameful.  Brexiteers can pursue their tragic, imperial delusions safe in the knowledge that their investments, their property portfolios and so on will be fine.  They may even see a tidy profit.  The daily lives of average citizens across the UK and across this island are merely collateral damage.  It is a shameful attitude.  In that context, the Bill is sadly necessary and outlines efforts to deal with practical, everyday issues such as the provision of electricity, education, healthcare, our harbours and so on.  We are trying to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work done by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and so many Departments to get this legislation ready.  A huge amount of work has gone into producing the Bill and it is not taken for granted.  Alongside the diplomatic efforts it has taken a huge amount of time and resources in recent months.  Much of it is understandably focused on trade but I am glad that areas like social protection, in section 11, are included.  I think of the people relying on State support, worried about how a no-deal Brexit might up-end that, and we need to ensure that they are looked after.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We also need to recognise that this Bill is largely a first attempt in an emergency situation and to a certain extent it is the bare minimum.  There are much bigger and more fundamental issues that are not covered in this legislation.  If the withdrawal agreement is not passed and a no-deal Brexit comes about, we will need to have the more serious conversations to which the Government has referred in recent weeks.   We will need to have those conversations in the Oireachtas and in our communities but also with the UK and the EU about how we can avoid a hard border on this island.  This is not something the Government can fix by way of primary legislation days before the 29 March deadline.  It emphasises that the emergency measures before us today are minimal.  If it is a no-deal scenario, and I dearly hope it is not, we will be back in this Chamber very soon debating and trying to work out much more fundamental issues.  The UK will be obliged to comply with World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules and Ireland will be obliged to comply with EU and WTO rules.  An external frontier of the EU could run across this island, and we are going to be asked how we can protect the integrity of the EU's Single Market.  It makes the threat of a hard border very real.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and in all our work, at every hearing, at every meeting, in every written submission, it has been made crystal clear just how important it is to avoid a hard border.  Members of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union were in Belfast last week and it was very powerful to listen to people and to hear their anxiety.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge this is a goal shared by everyone in this House, and I have continually recognised the hard work that has been done to have that reflected in the backstop.  In its work, the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, hears about this constantly from business representatives, professionals and legal experts.  We also hear it from community groups and individuals, and their fear and anxiety are very apparent.  People are scared about the economic, political and social impact that a hard Brexit and a hard border could have, and they do not see the plan to avoid it if the current withdrawal agreement is not accepted.  Diplomatically, we have been trying to square a circle, and people want to know what plan B is if this does not work.  At the moment, we do not have an answer for them, and it is causing huge anxiety.<\/p><p>Professor Colin Harvey of Queen's University, Belfast, gave a fantastic presentation to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recently on citizens' fundamental rights.  He asked what rights he will have as an Irish citizen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  He produced his Irish passport from his pocket and asked the committee to tell him what that document really means and stands for.  It is a good question and one being asked with increasing regularity by Irish citizens in the North.  They will remain EU citizens after Brexit, but they will not be able to vote in European elections and as such, will have no formal representation in the EU's democratic structures.  These are fundamental issues that remain unsolved, despite the common sense and practical measures proposed in the Bill.  I am not laying the blame at the feet of the Government and I recognise the difficult situation we are in but this is not something about which we can be complacent.  I appreciate that, for obvious diplomatic reasons, we have been careful in how we discuss what plan B is, choosing instead to emphasise the importance of a legally-binding backstop but we are getting to the point where the Government needs to tell people what plans are being made for the possibility that no agreement is reached.  It is not enough to say we are not planning for a hard border.  The point may arrive sooner than we would like where we are going to have to ask how.  If we work through the implications of the different scenarios, it seems obvious to me that a no-deal Brexit and pressure to enforce a hard border on this island are going to put a border poll on the table.  I fully understand the need to be sensitive on this but it is not inflammatory to say that a no-deal Brexit significantly increases the possibility that it could happen at some point in the coming years.  I have made this point to the T&aacute;naiste.  It is something we have to and need to talk about, in a manner that includes everyone on this island, and demonstrates a generosity of spirit and respect for diversity.  We need to be able to speak openly and carefully about what a border poll would mean in practice.  If people may be asked to vote on reunification, we need to be able to discuss what that would mean economically, politically, socially, and culturally, for everyone in Ireland.  Brexit itself should offer a warning of what can happen when one plunges head first into a referendum without proper discussion, care, consideration and planning beforehand.  We need to be willing to have these conversations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is all I am asking.

I dearly hope it will never be enacted.  All eyes will be on Westminster tonight.  It is also clear to me that we may need to come back to this Chamber very soon to work out a plan B well beyond what is contained in the Bill.  Those conversations may be more difficult but we need to face them with bravery, honesty and courage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#KK00200","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Senator Norris.  I welcome the Minister of State and commend her for her steady and calm handling of this issue.  I commend her officials and the T&aacute;naiste also.  We have had a very co-operative and collaborative approach in both Houses and everybody has worked with the Government in a constructive fashion on seeking a way through this disaster.  I think we all agree that Brexit is a disaster.  A no-deal Brexit is a disaster compounded and squared.  Unfortunately, it looks increasingly likely that this is what we are facing now.<\/p> <p>Others have pointed out how time moves on in politics.  A week may be a long time but this morning, two hours was a long time. At 10 a.m. it seemed as if the new joint instrument and the declaration might be enough to overturn that 230 vote majority against the withdrawal agreement on a previous occasion in Westminster.  However, by 12 noon, the British Attorney General, in the devastating final paragraph of his legal advice, appeared to have scuppered it.  Now the DUP has said it will vote against it, not just abstain, as have the other hard-line Tories.  It is extraordinary.  When one reads this short legal opinion of only 19 paragraphs, in fact, the other paragraphs seem to be leading to a different conclusion.  Paragraph 14, for example, suggests that the joint instrument and declaration provide a substantive and binding reinforcement of the legal rights available to the UK in the event that the EU were to fail in its duties of good faith and best endeavours.  There was an alternative reading.  Paragraph 19 seems to me to sit oddly with the rest of the opinion.  In any case, it is done now.<\/p> <p>Certainly, that is not the only piece of bad news.  Within the last hour, Nissan has announced that it will stop manufacturing a particular model of car in Sunderland.  We are going to see a lot more of this fall-out from Brexit.  The only positive one can draw from the likely defeat of the withdrawal agreement tonight in Westminster, if that vote goes ahead, is that it could trigger a second referendum in which remaining was one option and an orderly exit was the other.  That is the only positive development.  There is a way to that, through the amendment that is to be put forward next week by the Labour Party backbench MPs, Kyle and Wilson.  I think that vote will still go ahead.  It is hard to see how they would get to a majority, however.  Theresa May has said she will put the vote on a no-deal Brexit to the House of Commons tomorrow but if the majority rejects that, it means the majority will have rejected everything put to it.  We have not seen a majority for anything.  A majority may, indeed, vote for an extension to Article 50 but the other 27 member states need to sign up to that.  The T&aacute;naiste was on his feet a few minutes ago in the D&aacute;il saying that Ireland would not stand in the way of an extension if the UK does seek one.  However, the UK would need to give a reason in order to be seeking an extension with any real prospect of agreement from the other member states.<\/p> <p>Some senior Tories are suggesting that the only likely outcome tonight is going to be a general election in Britain.  That would certainly be a reason to extend Article 50.  Perhaps at this point it is the best scenario for Ireland.  It is very difficult to see any positive way through.  One would have to agree with the analysis of 43 former British ambassadors speaking a month ago, who talked about the fiasco of Brexit and the national crisis.  If a general election were called, it is not even clear what the manifestos of the Labour Party or the Tories would be.  I speak as a Labour Party member here, and we have done all we can to seek to influence our colleagues in the British Labour Party to take a clearer stance in support of \"Remain\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope that will come through more clearly in light of recent developments.  There is a powerful cross-party movement in Britain for a second referendum and a people's vote.  This is the only light that can be seen at the moment.<\/p><p>The Bill before us is a complex Bill, which we all hope will not be needed.  Deputy Joan Burton called it a \"just-in-case Bill\".  My Labour Party colleagues and I will support the Bill in a constructive spirit.  We recognise that it is necessary to pass it but we hope it will not be necessary to implement it.<\/p><p>There are three issues of concern.  First is the constitutional issue which my colleague and party leader, Deputy Howlin, raised in the D&aacute;il.  There is concern around whether section 4 of the Bill overreaches the power of delegation of legislation and whether the Bill purports to give Ministers power, effectively, to amend primary legislation in a way contrary to Article 15 of the Constitution, as well as case law such as the Laurentiu case and the Mulcreevy case of 2004.  We can tease that issue out more effectively on Committee Stage but there is a concern that the power to delegate is too broadly stated and would replace the power to make primary legislation.  The Minister said secondary legislation was in preparation but we need to make sure we do not fall foul of our Constitution in framing secondary legislation.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin also raised questions about tax arrangements and pointed out that Part 6 might appear to give preferential tax treatment to the UK, which would be in breach of our obligations under the GATT treaty and the normal WTO rules.  I will raise this again on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Finally, in the context of immigration, how will Brexit impact on the rights of non-EEA family members of British citizens currently resident in Ireland?  This has been raised with me and may have been raised with other colleagues so I will seek clarification of that on Committee Stage.  We will reluctantly be supporting this Bill on a cross-party basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#MM00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>For the first time, I understand the attitude of General de Gaulle when Britain applied for membership.  He saw how difficult and awkward a member Britain would prove to be.  We are in a catastrophic situation because party interests were put ahead of national interests and it is a disgrace to politics that this was allowed to happen in Britain.  The other night, I listened to a Tory MP who said it was like they were in the jungle or the rainforest, hacking their way through but not knowing the direction in which they were going and feeling they were going around in circles.  That is exactly what is happening here.  Mr. Cox is a rather unsuitable person for this role and he would be more at home playing \"Rumpole of the Bailey\" with his jokes about his codpiece and other things.  This is an intensely serious and potentially catastrophic situation and the dimensions of his codpiece are of no relevance or significance.<\/p> <p>The Bill is a portmanteau Bill.  It is coming very late in the day, with two weeks to go until Brexit, but it is here.  I wonder what has been left out and I am quite certain we will discover that some things have been left out.  It is inevitable and I am not blaming anybody.  As a result of Mr. Cox's statement to the House of Commons, I believe he has sunk Theresa May's deal and that is a very good thing.  I am very pleased because it was a half measure.  We do not want a deal and we do not want Britain to be out of the European Union but to stay in it.<\/p> <p>I see Mrs. May's deal being voted down and the no-deal scenario also being voted down, following which they will look for an extension.

I believe that there will not be a no-deal situation but the Government is right to consider it because serious issues are involved.  There are the questions of aviation connectivity and road freight connectivity.  Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, predicted that flights throughout Europe would stop.  While that is unlikely, it is a frightening prospect.  A strike in France resulted in a line of lorries 17 miles long, which is what we can look forward to.  The landbridge in Britain will be absolutely landmined if that country leaves without a deal.<\/p> <p>The common travel area is extremely important, as the Minister of State noted, and I join my colleagues in complimenting her.  The attitude of some British politicians has been disgraceful.  There was an idea that a second famine could be visited on this country.  Have they no shame, no sense of history and no sense of what a humanitarian disaster the Famine was?  It is shocking to think about revisiting it.  While it is true that we must maintain the common travel area, it predates the EU and, therefore, should be saved for historic reasons.  We have had it since 1922 and we cannot possibly go back on it.<\/p> <p>There is also the issue of health services.  It is obvious that patients in County Donegal, for example, need to go to hospital in County Derry rather than coming all the way round, hour after hour, in an ambulance to Dublin.  Of course we must keep these ideas.  Old age pensions, illness benefit and child benefit must immediately be put on track because people on the margins depend on these services and if their payments are held up, they will be in real trouble.  There was a reference to free fees but that is a load of rubbish.  There is no such thing as free fees.  One either pays fees or the education is free.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that the Government has introduced supports, on which I compliment it, but while I have listened to advertisements on the radio, I note that many firms, particularly small and medium enterprises, have not yet signed up to a no-deal Brexit programme.  The financial services is one area in which there is no doubt that we can benefit and it is a plus for Ireland.  More than 200 financial services firms have decided to relocate from London and more than half of them are coming to Dublin, which is a tribute to the financial genius of the city of Dublin and the country of Ireland.  Out of the disaster of Brexit, if we can take one crumb of comfort, it is that this area will be protected and developed.  I look forward to it developing in a very positive manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#OO00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I join in the welcome to my neighbour, the Minister of State, and the general commendation of her great work and tenacity in this area.  It is becoming more problematic by the hour but if the vote is not won tonight, we all have to hope that a crash-out, no-deal Brexit will be ruled out tomorrow.  That has to be the next best hope if the vote fails tonight.  At that point, the onus remains on us, as is the objective of today's legislation, which I support, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and all its elements, and to protect as much co-operation between the UK and the Republic of Ireland as is conceivably possible.  There is a commitment in the protocol to the protection of the agreement.  There is also a commitment to the common travel area and various bilateral arrangements but this will hopefully actualise those.  Fundamental rights are guaranteed in the protocol.<\/p> <p>If there is a crash-out, Ireland and the EU will have a responsibility to protect the Single Market and customs union.  The UK will be affected by the requirements of the WTO.  All of those situations will have to be considered by respective governments.  It was clear in last night's commitments and from talk in this House and elsewhere that the backstop is not intended as a threat to the UK.  It is purely, as has been well plotted out, an insurance policy.  There are sinister elements in the UK and, tragically, on this land, who are trying to misconstrue that.  Let us call a spade a spade, since people are debating this question whose particular personal and family circumstances are such that they, their offspring or extended families could never be affected by the outcome, even if it was negative.  They are insulated by considerable wealth and that makes their behaviour all the more reprehensible and unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I would like to once again take a cursory look at the implications of a no-deal Brexit.  That is a malign scenario that none of us wants.  I do not believe it will arise because tomorrow will prevent that, and it will play out quite differently.  None of us wants to contemplate that and nobody here seriously believes that will happen.  There are a few stark statistics.  Out of our entire export of services from this island, worth &euro;101 billion, 18%, or approximately &euro;18 billion,  goes to the UK.  Of &euro;112 billion of goods exported from this island, &euro;15.6 billion or 13.9% goes to the UK.  Meat or beef comprises &euro;1.9 billion, dairy products, &euro;800 million and pharmaceuticals, &euro;1.5 billion in trade between here and the UK.  Visits from the UK comprise 41% of trips to Ireland.  Those implications are national and I gather that it would take &euro;1 billion out of the agriculture industry immediately.<\/p> <p>I ask Members to contemplate the horrific implications for the Border region.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is acutely familiar with a region bordering her own home, in Cavan-Monaghan, and along the Border.  The implications are beyond horrendous because of the many trading links and the passage of goods, North and South.  There is a matter my good friend, Senator Richmond, had to listen to repeatedly when I went to London and which I cite as a classic example.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In Bailieborough, the small town in which I live, Lakeland Dairies provides approximately 300 jobs.  Some 56% of its milk is sourced north of the Border.  Were there to be a hard Brexit, that would have to be processed in the new LacPatrick Dairies arrangement north of the Border.  The locks could be put on the town of Bailieborough if Lakeland Dairies were removed from it.  This is just one typical example which repeats itself in every village and town along the Border with various trading links involving the cattle industry, the milk industry, the pig industry where pigs are going North to be processed, Carton Brothers in Shercock, etc.  The implications in that area are enormous.  It merits repeating that it is our responsibility to try to avoid it and we are collectively doing our best.<\/p><p>We have achieved a few good things.  The European Commission has announced an increased in the ceiling for national support to farmers from &euro;15,000 to &euro;25,000.  That progress is to be applauded.  It will be necessary in all scenarios and particularly in the bad ones.  This year's budget allocated &euro;78 million to protect business against Brexit.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has spearheaded a getting-Brexit-ready information campaign across the country with 2,500 people having availed of the expertise there.  Revenue has engaged with 80,000 businesses on their customs obligations.<\/p><p>The Bill makes a number of provisions.  It provides for health services operating North and South across the Border, with paediatrics coming to Dublin, etc.  That is an important sphere.  The single electricity market remains important and is protected by this legislation.  Student grants and student exchanges from one country to the other are covered.  Pensions are critical.  I know many people living on a UK pension, including a first cousin of mine.  It is so important that those are provided for.<\/p><p>In summary I would make a few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#PP00100","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#QQ00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We need to continue working for a seamless border.

We, who have such an interest, should have had ours done some time ago.<\/p><p>As the time is now, however, it is right and proper that we debate this single omnibus Bill made up of 15 Parts relating to matters within the remit of nine Ministers.  I am heartened to see the strong co-operation across the House to move the Bill forward.  I commend the civil servants and staff of each of the Ministers on the important and technical job they have done.  Fianna F&aacute;il will do all it can to facilitate the passage of this Bill and to ensure this emergency legislation is in place as required.  The Bill prioritises issues we need to urgently address but, unfortunately, it cannot fully protect us from the havoc a no-deal Brexit would wreak on our trading relationship with the UK, our all-island economy and the peace process.<\/p><p>It is clear that, in addition to this Bill, the industries and sectors most exposed to Brexit need additional support and financial aid.  Thousands of jobs are on the line and businesses and SMEs need much greater support and assistance than the Government has offered to date.  The time for waiting and seeing what happens has long passed.  There is no room for complacency when it comes to safeguarding jobs and our economic prosperity.  The Bill, which would reduce the possibility of a serious disturbance in the economy of the State and the sound functioning of a number of market sectors and fields of State as a result of a disorderly Brexit is, therefore, urgent and most important.<\/p><p>Some 100 years ago, our founding fathers and mothers fought for a better future and we must fight for a better future for all - the future that our ancestors wished for.  It is vital that we have a proper plan.  Historically, we have not been great at master plans.  We learn as we go and, as a nation, we behave as if we have not been here for a long time.  We deny our true strengths.  We should be incredibly proud of our unique position in Europe as the only nation formed in the aftermath of the First World War with a continuous 100 years of parliamentary diplomacy, without occupation or dictatorship.<\/p><p>As friends of the UK, we must allow for space but, by the same token, we must protect ourselves.  Yes, we are protected by our friends in Europe but there are worrying times ahead, politically and economically.  I am concerned about the small details.  I am certain everyone who has worked on this has tried to think of all the scenarios but there are always situations where unintended consequences arise out of the best plans.  No matter what happens in the days to come, I am deeply concerned about the added pressures on the housing stock, as well as the potential for huge barriers to trade and tariffs on goods.  I worry about the disruption of the supply chain of materials needed for construction and the knock-on effect of increased costs and delays in construction.  Anything which may impact on the delivery of housing, public or private, or potential additional demands on the current housing stock is a massive cause for concern.  What are the financial implications arising from the Bill if additional money is required and where will it come from?  The haulage industry still has no clarity on the situation with regard to non-Irish drivers needing to cross the landbridge.  Drivers are still confused about what will be required of them should they venture to Northern Ireland in their own cars.<\/p><p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have jointly leveraged Exchequer funding to create a &euro;300 million loan scheme for businesses impacted by Brexit, with 40% of the funding ring-fenced for the food sector.  However, the latest parliamentary question replies released show that out of 42 eligible applications from food companies, just eight were approved for finance under this loan scheme.  The Minister of State should address this point.  Shockingly, this means just one in five eligible loan applications for the sector have actually been approved for funding worth &euro;3.8 million.  Worse still, this equates to just over 1% of the total &euro;300 million loan scheme having been approved for food companies so far.<\/p><p>Worryingly, we are over two and a half years on from the Brexit referendum and the Government continues to refuse to request at EU level the temporary relaxation of state aid competition rules in order to ready grant support schemes to safeguard exposed Irish export enterprises and jobs that will be impacted by a hard Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently called for an enterprise stabilisation fund and employment support scheme to be made available to the worst affected firms as a policy response to protect from the impact of a hard Brexit.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An incredible amount of issues would be worsened in the event of a crash-out Brexit.  This Bill prepares us for many things, but not for everything.  We cannot legislate for everything so we must see the Bill as the beginning.  We will learn a great deal from these uncertain times but I believe we will be scarred by this lesson.  This is very important for Ireland and our economy.  We need more information and there must be more awareness.  Numerous people and businesses have come to my clinics to ask me what we are doing.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify some of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#QQ00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to the House for what is a sad but important debate on the Bill before us.  These are grave and serious political times.  They cause a huge weight of concern for our citizens, both North and South.  It reminds me of just over ten years ago when we were legislating for the bailout, the upheaval of that time, the consequences that followed and the concerns of our citizens then.  There is similar uncertainty now regarding the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and the potential damage it could inflict on our citizens and economy.  This has the potential to reach all levels of society in a negative way.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister of State on the manner in which she has engaged with our EU partners and dealt with this very difficult issue to date.  I note how she built solid support from our EU partners across the EU.  She has also dealt with sometimes hostile and unreasonable comment and argument in respect of Brexit and the Irish position.  I also wish to commend the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the diplomatic corps in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the work they have done in protecting Ireland's interests in these difficult negotiations.<\/p> <p>This is a tragic political time.  It is a no-win scenario for the UK, Ireland and the EU regardless of the outcome, but we must do all in our power to mitigate the consequences.  It undoubtedly will have a deep impact on the UK and its citizens and, sadly, on Ireland's citizens too.  It is like witnessing a slow car crash, which is tragic.  I recognise the solidarity shown by our EU partners.  This is not an accident but is a result of the intense engagement of our Ministers, who continue to work on building understanding and support for the Irish position.  It is a fact that many of our citizens, both North and South, are fearful about the uncertainty, consequences and impact of Brexit.  There is uncertainty about the impact on trade and the possibility of tariffs, the impact on jobs and businesses and the impact on lifestyle standards and choices, travel and education.  There are also obvious concerns about the Border region, as we have heard from colleagues.<\/p> <p>We are an island nation and we must not forget that.  We are depending on our EU partners and, indeed, the UK for trade and interconnectivity on many levels.  I come from the south east and there is deep concern in that region and in Waterford.  It has a strong agrifood sector that relies heavily on exports to, and trade with, the UK.  Companies such as Glanbia, Dawn Meats Group Limited and many others, as well as the thousands of people in farm families, the primary producers, are depending on as good and positive an outcome as possible.  It is critical that we continue to support the Government as it continues on this difficult path.  It is also critical that the European Commission stands by Ireland and puts the necessary supports and contingency arrangements in place to provide for all eventualities and mitigate against the damage.<\/p> <p>Today is a significant day in the House of Commons.  I wish the MPs the very best in their deliberations and decisions today.  There is fading hope for a majority to accept the deal and there are concerns about the support that is required if it is not passed today.  It will leave a no-deal scenario, which is high risk and has major consequences for all.  As a politician, however, I still retain hope that politics can find a solution.  Politics is, after all, the art of the possible.  Constituents and citizens depend on leadership from their representatives, both in the UK and Ireland.  Sadly, it has been lacking so far in the UK but we retain hope that they will find a solution.  I acknowledge the role of the Opposition in Ireland, including Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independents, in facilitating this Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to emphasise that we can do without political point-scoring at this very critical stage. <\/p><p>There is a very noticeable void in the House of Commons in terms of representing the nationalist voice of Northern Ireland.  It is a shame that all we are hearing is the amplified voice of the DUP.  That party is actually ignoring its own constituents and the concerns being raised by unionist business men and women and by unionist farmers regarding a no-deal Brexit.  All we are hearing from the DUP are narrow, single-minded, party-political arguments that are of grave concern to all.  The DUP is putting polarising political views ahead of the genuine concerns of citizens.  The majority of people in Northern Ireland voted against Brexit and the vast majority voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is critical that their views are reflected in the debate and that the Good Friday Agreement is upheld.  We simply cannot afford to go back to the dark days of the past.  It is essential that we uphold the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, a priority for the Irish Government and the Irish people.  It is also important that we find a workable future relationship with the UK, as our nearest neighbour.  We must continue to listen to and advocate for citizens in Northern Ireland who are genuinely concerned and fearful of the consequences of Brexit.  As the Taoiseach has said, they cannot be left behind.  <\/p><p>We are debating this Bill reluctantly in this House today.  We hope that the Opposition will support us in our efforts to have it passed efficiently and effectively.  It is not a Bill that anyone here wants to see implemented, as many have said already.  This is a very distressing period, given the uncertainty that the British vote to leave the EU has caused.  I am glad that the common travel area will be protected.  This is a long-standing agreement between the UK and Ireland and its maintenance is something that the Irish Government set as one of its key objectives at the very outset.  I wish this Bill well as it passes through the House.  It is a Bill of last resort which puts in place provisions to mitigate the potentially disastrous consequences for Ireland and the UK of a no-deal Brexit.   <\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State well in her ongoing engagements with our EU partners, the UK and other stakeholders.  She has the support of Fine Gael and everyone in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#SS00200","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552392000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I want to start today by acknowledging the faceless people behind this Bill, the public servants who have worked tirelessly to bring it forward and who have supported the Minister of State and her Government colleagues in their work in Europe.  The Minister of State, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, the Taoiseach and the Government must be commended on their steadfast support for the view that this country's interests come first.  They have missed no opportunity to drive that forward.<\/p> <p>This is a Bill of last resort.  We all hoped that we would not get to this stage but we are here now.  We could criticise things and suggest that things have been missed but that is not why we are here now.  We are here to support the Government and get this Bill through.  I know many Irish people in the UK who are deeply concerned about how Brexit will impact them.  I also have many friends and colleagues in the North of Ireland who are very concerned, particularly small business owners who are unsure as to whether they should move to the Republic in order to maintain those businesses.  I am thinking about them today.  <\/p> <p>The divisive people in the UK, particularly at Westminster, and some in this country who would want to see this all go wrong need to step back a little.  I have no doubt that the work that the Government has done will ensure that, as far as possible, we will be supported by Europe if a no-deal scenario emerges but the UK will suffer badly.  Our brothers and sisters in the North of Ireland who are depending on an all-island solution will suffer badly.  <\/p> <p>I wish to express my gratitude to the Minister of State, the Government and to departmental officials for the work they have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031200002#TT00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1552392000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
