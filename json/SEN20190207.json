Its population has increased by more than 30%.  The town has witnessed major infrastructural development in terms of schools and roads.  Other infrastructural and sporting projects have all developed amazingly during the past decade.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to the lack of affordable housing in the town.  Work is under way on six private developments in the town.  An important social housing scheme comprising 40 houses is under construction, which is a very welcome development.  This importance of this &euro;9.7 million project needs to be acknowledged.  The remaining portion of land in the ownership of Cork County Council is quite significant.  The original plan was that this site could provide anything up to 150 houses but I am not sure if that figure still stands.  I understand an affordable housing scheme to be one that can involve both the local authority and private developers building houses at a cheaper rate to facilitate members of the general public accessing housing cheaper and also being able to have ownership of the property.<\/p> <p>This land has been in the ownership of the local authority since the early days of millennium.  Very little has been done with this land, other than the work carried out in recent months.  There is a wonderful opportunity to develop it for the residents of Kinsale.  We have nearly everything that is needed to do that bar the will to drive the development of such a project.  I would be hopeful that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government could instruct the local authority to move to ensure the development of the asset of this land portfolio.<\/p> <p>It is almost criminal that such land in the ownership of Cork County Council is not being developed.  This is a significant issue for the town.  We have spoken about land in the ownership of the State and about the housing crisis.  We have an affordable housing crisis and a social housing crisis in Kinsale.  We need a pathway to ensure the development of this land portfolio, whether it be through a public private partnership or the Department instructing the local authority that it will put the value of the land portfolio against the houses.  A mechanism needs to be put in place to ensure the delivery of this site for the construction of affordable housing in Kinsale.  This site could accommodate a significant number of houses, be it 50, 60 or 70.  I am not sure how many it could accommodate but the land is available.  We need the political will to develop it.  We need central government to work with the  local authority to deliver housing on the remainder of this land portfolio.  If that was done it would provide a perfect mix in Kinsale with an affordable housing scheme that, hopefully, we can get off the ground, the social scheme currently being built and the other private developments.<\/p> <p>The lack of an affordable housing scheme is the gap in the market that the people are talking about.  Such a scheme would assist a household with two incomes who find they are just short of what they need to get mortgage.  We need to ensure Cork County Council moves on this project.  That is important.  We need leadership from central government to ensure we get that movement on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#A00700","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising a very important issue for Kinsale as well as the wider issue of the affordability of housing and the Government's plans to deliver affordable housing.  The Senator is correct in saying that I have connections in Kinsale and I am always glad to discuss it and to visit it because it is a fabulous part of the country.  It is an area that is doing very well in the context of job creation, business and tourism.  It is a very self sufficient town for which housing is very important.  I have family who are very happy living in Kinsale.  The town is well served with schools and other education facilities but it is important that we deliver the necessary housing there too.  I am glad to say that 40 social housing units are being built on a site in the town.  Work on that site began just before Christmas and it is great to see construction activity there.  I hope to visit it soon.<\/p> <p>While the issue raised by Senator Lombard this morning is affordable housing, when it comes to social housing it must be said that there is a lot happening in Cork.  Cork County Council is probably one of the leading local authorities when it comes to the delivery of social housing under the direction of Mr. Tim Lucey, the county manager, and Mr. Maurice Manning, director of service for housing and his team.  I have met them on numerous occasions to discuss social housing projects as well as affordable housing schemes.  They are very interested in driving on with the development of affordable housing.  The Senator is on the nail in terms of the importance of affordable housing and Cork County Council understands that too and has been doing good work in that area.  I am happy to work with the local authorities in Cork to bring forward more proposals.  <\/p> <p>In fairness to all local authorities, they have been doing good work over the last year or two in rebuilding their housing teams, putting in serious effort and concentrating on the delivery of housing.  That is now paying off.  The delivery of social housing has increased a lot and we now have a healthy pipeline of projects.  In Cork, the pipeline contains more than 1,700 units over the next few years.  We want to double that again and keep going.  There is good pressure there in terms of social housing and now that we have the social housing delivery back on track, we want to move on to a key phase, which is the delivery of affordable housing for those who are at work but who are unable to afford a mortgage on the open market.  Affordable housing is for those people earning less than approximately &euro;75,000 jointly who would not be in a position to buy a house at full market value but who, with some help from local authorities in terms of providing sites, would be able to access an affordable home.  In this context, the State's land bank has an important role to play.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard has asked whether land in Kinsale which is owned by Cork County Council can be used for affordable housing and the short answer is \"Yes\".  It can be used and it will be used if all the plans for it come together.  I will outline the position in that regard shortly.  More generally, the State land bank plays a vital role in delivering housing.  Increasing and accelerating housing delivery, particularly for social and affordable purposes, is at the heart of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's action plan for housing and homelessness.  The Minister has made it clear that the focus will be on affordable housing going forward.  The plan places a particular focus on maximising the output of housing from the land banks of housing authorities, the Housing Agency and the broader public sector.  Thankfully, there is a large State-owned land bank in Cork.  There is enough land to deliver more than 3,500 houses.  There is also land in Cork in the ownership of the Housing Agency that can be used for housing.  There are many sites available, amounting to 160 ha, in State ownership that can be developed for social, affordable and private housing.<\/p> <p>On the site in Kinsale, to which Senator Lombard refers, I understand that Cork County Council has conducted an economic assessment and concluded that it would qualify for affordable housing.  The site was not put forward in the first round of affordable housing projects announced in June of last year.  We have now set aside &euro;310 million for the serviced sites fund which will service land belonging to local authorities and a second round will open in the coming weeks.  The local authority in Cork has assessed four or five different sites for affordable housing, and the site at Glanmire qualified for funding in the first round.  When the next round opens, I imagine it will put forward the site at Kinsale as well as others located in Mallow, Midleton, Carrigaline and Clonakilty, all of which would pass the test for affordable housing.  I hope that we will see a number of applications submitted by the local authority in Cork.  I see no reason for Kinsale not being successful.  Indeed, development of that site would compliment the work that is going on there already to provide social housing.  If everything goes to plan, 40 affordable housing units could be delivered in Kinsale.  There may even be some space to deliver more.  <\/p> <p>We are trying to use State owned land throughout the country.  We know that there are approximately 1,700 ha of land in the ownership of local authorities and we want to see a lot of it used for housing.  While it will not all be suitable for housing, the majority of it can be utilised for a blend of social, affordable and private housing.  Cork is leading the way in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#B00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which was very informative.  I welcome the announcement of a second round of funding to service sites for affordable housing.  That will give the opportunity for sites in Carrigaline, Kinsale and Clonakilty to be brought back into the system.  That is what I wanted to hear this morning.  I am glad the scheme will be reopened and other sites will be considered.  Kinsale is a very important site, as are the sites at Clonakilty and Carrigaline, in the context of the growing population around Cork city.  I welcome the Minister of State's assurance that there will be a second round of funding and I ask him to work closely with officials from the local authority to ensure that the sites to which I refer can be included.  If they are included, that will be the last string in the bow in terms of affordable housing projects that we need to get off the ground in Cork.  If these sites can be brought to market, the knock on effect will be very positive.  Those people whose joint income is less than &euro;70,000 will be able to access affordable housing.  The desire to own a home is very strong in Ireland.  People really want to own their homes.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to clarify when he is proposing to reopen the scheme to applications.

The funding was increased in budget 2019.  We will be opening the scheme again in the next few weeks but I do not have an exact date at the moment.  Local authorities will be invited to make applications for funding for various sites, including the ones we referred to in Cork.  I expect that the site in Kinsale will be on the application from Cork County Council.  We have engaged with local authority officials on this.  We had a workshop in November with the local authorities which was attended by Mr. Maurice Manning and his team and they engaged fully with us.  I was in Cork recently with Senator Lombard to open a housing project and had further discussions with Mr. Manning about opportunities to provide more affordable housing.  He is very much on the ball.<\/p> <p>In terms of how the process will work, local authorities will apply to the fund which will help to service the land that they own.  The regulations for the scheme will be announced in the next couple of weeks by the Minister.  These regulations will clarify who qualifies for the scheme.  It is expected that those who would qualify for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, that is, those with a joint income of around &euro;75,000, or a single income of &euro;50,000 will qualify for affordable housing.  Each local authority will decide itself on the priority and allocation process in terms of who qualifies for any houses built.  The allocation systems will be designed locally.<\/p> <p>This is a good scheme and we hope it will deliver between 6,000 and 7,000 houses over the next few years.  We will have an opportunity to deliver a lot more into the future too.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#B00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Functions","time":1549535400,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#B00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach's office for selecting this matter.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the reserved functions of the elected members of city and county councils in the context of the capital budget.  As we all know, all local authorities have a revenue budget and a capital budget.  Each local authority adopts its budget annually.  Members can accept, amend or reject the day-to-day revenue budget but there seems to be some misunderstanding in relation to the capital budget.  There is an inconsistency across the 31 local authorities in terms of how the capital budget is treated.<\/p> <p>Some weeks ago, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, was in this House talking about local government reform.  He spoke about the need for greater transparency and accountability.  He also spoke about empowering local city and county councillors to manage their organisations.  He referred to fancy ideas about mayors in some local authorities but not in others.  He said that it is Government policy to empower local councillors and to give them more functions and powers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I acknowledge the important step in that regard.  I want to be clear about it, however, and that is why I am seeking a response today.<\/p><p>I have in front of me legal advice from a number of local authorities.  There is inconsistency in that advice.  The Minister of State will be aware that section 135 of the Local Government Act 2001 clearly deals with capital budgets and the reserved and executive functions.  Where there is an absence of a reserved function, it is usually inferred that it falls back on the executive.  As a result, there is inconsistency.<\/p><p>I have spoken to a number of the Minister of State's party colleagues from various councils about this.  I would have believed it right and proper that members would have the right to accept, amend or reject capital budgets.  They are entrusted with responsibility and they are elected by the people.  It is important and correct that the executive prepares the rolling three-year capital budget but there is inconsistency across local authorities.  Some very good chief executives engage with their corporate policy group, bring the measure through the various sections in the council and seek interaction with the elected members while others quite bluntly refuse to do so, stating that it is an absolute executive function and that they have one obligation, namely, to go to the council and tell the members what has been agreed.  That is crazy.<\/p><p>If we are serious about local government reform and empowering elected city and county councillors, we need to address this issue.  I hope to hear today the Minister of State's professional legal advice from within the Department.  More important, I want to hear a sympathetic Minister state that this has to be a matter for the elected members of the councils.  Surely elected representatives have to hold an executive to account.  Surely elected councillors have a right to decide the priorities of their funding.  That is important.  I am not trying to water down any functions of the executives of any local authority, lest they think otherwise, but I want to be sure city and county councillors are empowered to accept, amend or reject capital budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#B00500","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Victor Boyhan for raising this issue.  I gather it is not the first time he has raised it.  As usual, he is persistent on these matters in order to get to the detail.  That is fair enough; that is what it is all about.  I hope to clarify the issue as best I can.  The Senator has raised an important question concerning the ability of local authority members to use their role to the maximum and also to have a say on major projects in their counties, be they local or of national significance.  Certainly, capital expenditure is important.  As we roll out Project Ireland 2040, which is a major capital expenditure programme for the country for the next ten years and beyond and which involves an allocation of &euro;120 billion in taxpayers' money, it is important that local authorities be involved in capital projects and in ensuring that they happen on time and, if at all possible, within budget.  Expenditure is an ongoing issue as costs increase.<\/p> <p>As set out in correspondence to the Senator from my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, it is not the role of Ministers to provide legal advice.  We cannot do that.  It is interesting that the Senator has obtained different legal advice from different sources.  It will differ depending on who gives it.  We cannot give the Senator legal advice but I will be happy to confirm what the legislation sets out and what it is meant to be.  That is the best I can do for the Senator.<\/p> <p>Elected members of local authorities are vested with various reserved functions that enable them to direct and oversee the activities of the local authority generally.  These reserved functions are provided for by a broad suite of enactments.  Section 149(4) of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides that every function of a local authority that is not a reserved function is an executive function to be carried out by the chief executive.  Part 14 of the 2001 Act sets out the role of the elected council and provides that it is a reserved function of the elected members to adopt a revenue budget; this provision does not extend to the capital budget or plan.  I am no sure of the history of that but that is the way it always has been.  It could certainly be considered in the future.  It was not a change in 2001; it was always that way.  I am just clarifying, from our point of view, what the legislation states.<\/p> <p>Section 135 of the 2001 Act provides that before the start of each local financial year, the chief executive shall prepare and submit to the elected council a report indicating the programme of capital projects proposed by the local authority for the forthcoming year and the following two local financial years, having regard to the availability of resources.  This report may be considered at the local authority budget meeting or at such other meeting as the elected council may by resolution decide.  While the Act provides that both the revenue budget and capital plan be placed before the elected members, section 103 requires the revenue budget to be adopted by the members, while section 135 requires that the capital programme be submitted for consideration and comment only.<\/p> <p>The Senator asked me about best practice.  I am stating the position in the legislation.  To me, it is best practice and would make sense for councillors to consult on and debate the capital programme, and even vote on a motion thereon.  I would imagine that, in most cases, local authorities do so.  From talking to councillors around the country, I am aware that they generally feel they have a say in this regard.  It happens in practice although it might not always be set out in legislation.  It would be good practice to have the members on board in respect of projects and to bring them with one as best one can.<\/p> <p>Other relevant provisions of the 2001 Act addressing the role of elected members in the area of capital budgeting - this is where they do have very clear powers - include: section 137, which provides that the elected council may by resolution require the chief executive to prepare plans and specifications for particular works and an estimate of their cost; section 138, which provides that the chief executive shall inform the elected council before any works, other than maintenance or repair, of the local authority are undertaken or before committing the local authority concerned to any expenditure in connection with the proposed works; and section 139, which provides that, once the elected council is informed in accordance with section 138 of any works, it may by resolution direct that those works shall not proceed.  Therein lies the power of a local authority member when it comes to capital projects.  It is very clear that they have a role if they have a difficulty with or are positively disposed towards a project.  Section 140 provides that the elected council may, by resolution and subject to the requirements of the section, direct that any specific act be done by the local authority.   Again, the elected members have very powers in this regard, which is important.  This might satisfy the Senator regarding what elected members can do under the law.<\/p> <p>While responsibility for the full range of local authority functions is split between the elected members and the executive, the intention has always been that the members, in the exercise of their role, would act on a basis akin to that of a board of directors served by a full-time chief executive.  Councillors, in my view, are the directors of a local authority.  They have a very serious and important role.  That is very clear in the Department's interpretation.<\/p> <p>The legal character of a local authority thus comprises two elements, the elected council and the executive, with responsibility for performing local authority functions shared between them.  Legally, however, all functions, whether performed by the elected council or by the chief executive, are exercised on behalf of the local authority.  While the law must provide for a precise division of functions, and responsibility for their exercise may be clearly defined, in practice the policy and executive roles are intended to be complementary.  That is best practice.  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the Seanad on this matter.  I hope I brought some clarity to the legal position.<\/p> <p>Most capital projects require the raising of money, which means loans.  Government grants might be available for some part of a project.  Under Project Ireland 2040, taxpayers' money, spent through Departments, will fund a significant amount but in some cases money will also have to be found locally.  Local authority members have to pass loans.  The cost of the loans, in interest, is part of a revenue budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#C00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that.

I also appreciate his knowledge on this matter.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, the Minister of State said it makes sense for councillors, elected members, to be involved with the capital budget.  Of course it does.  The Minister of State is clearly saying there is no provision in legislation.  This is the Legislature.  The Minister of State can take it from me today that I will, very soon in the next few weeks, seek to muster up support among members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for what I propose.  It is timely in the run-up to a local election, when politicians are going around the country canvassing and talking about powers in their communities, that we identify the absolute weakness.  I will write to the Minister formally today asking him to ask his colleagues and the Minister to examine this matter again.  We have identified a real problem here.  In some councils, when the manager has his or her capital budget he or she then proceeds to enter into commitments.  When people enter commitments, it costs money.

As we know, there is a cost review of this project ongoing at a cost of just under &euro;500,000.  We are told the review will be carried out relatively quickly and that we could press pause on the project while the review is ongoing because there has not been much more than the base works and groundworks completed on the site so far.

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  I assure him that I take the matter of the increased cost of the new children's hospital very seriously.  The significant increase in costs was and remains extremely disappointing and concerning.<\/p> <p>When Government approved the construction investment decision in April 2017, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project, following the evaluation of main construction tenders and selection of preferred contractors, was &euro;983 million, of which &euro;916 million was to be met by the Exchequer.  In December 2018, following completion of the guaranteed maximum price process, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project stood at &euro;1.433 billion.  The total of &euro;450 million requires net additional Exchequer funding of &euro;320 million, of which &euro;50 million is VAT, and an additional &euro;130 million in philanthropy funding.<\/p> <p>In December 2018, when the Government approved the construction investment to allow phase B of the hospital to be instructed, it made very clear its serious concerns about the major escalation in the cost of the project.  The Government considered the alternative options and made the decision on 18 December to proceed with the project with the current contractor.<\/p> <p>The new children's hospital project is under way, the contractor is on site at the St. James's Hospital campus and construction work is well under way on the two associated outpatient and urgent care centres, with the outpatient urgent care centre in Connolly Hospital due to open in a couple of months and the centre in Tallaght Hospital opening next year.  We must replace outdated hospital buildings with modern and appropriate infrastructure designed to best serve the needs of our children and their families and of the staff who care for them as soon as possible.  This project will not be halted.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, however, the Government approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum in respect of the new children's hospital.  This independent review has been commissioned by the HSE and is being undertaken by PwC.  The terms of reference have been revised and finalised and have now been published.  The primary focus of the review is on the governance and management arrangements in place within and between the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the executive, design team, relevant consultants, user groups and contractors.  The review will deal with the accountability of the relevant key parties, functions and roles.  This may inform appropriate next steps by decision-makers, including Government.  The review will establish the sequence of events regarding the cost increases experienced by the project; what was known, when and by whom; and the reporting of relevant information from the project team to the relevant oversight and governance bodies, including the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and its committees, the HSE and the Department of Health.  The terms of reference also require the review to develop any further recommendations which may identify any areas of potential cost savings or reductions which are consistent with the applicable contractual undertakings and the delivery of the project in light of its current status, address major residual risks, control and oversight issues and bring greater oversight of performance and value for money.<\/p> <p>The development board is fully committed to collaborating with this review and to implementing any recommendations arising.  The HSE and the Department will equally fully support the expeditious conduct and implementation of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#D00700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming here to handle this matter.

If these guys carry out a review and come back and tell us what we all know, that is, that this has got out of control and is costing double what we originally thought it would cost, how can we say \"this project will not be halted\" before we get back the results of the review?

There was much consideration of the options by the Department, the Minister and officials in the HSE prior to that meeting.  A decision was taken not to halt the project, and that decision was not taken lightly, I assure the Senator.<\/p> <p>As for the issue of the review being undertaken and commissioned by the Government, it is important to maintain a distance between the two different issues.

Now we are informed that a successful candidate from that process is due to start in the summer of 2019.

However, St. Vincent's University Hospital stated that, as a voluntary hospital, it operates its own recruitment policy and has full discretion regarding appointments.<\/p><p>We talk about value for money and adherence to policies but the hospital is funded by the State, which does not often sit comfortably with the hospital, so it should follow the HSE guidelines.  The hospital was not slow about following the HSE's guidelines when it came to pay cuts for healthcare staff.  The hospital cannot pick and choose what it will adhere to.  <\/p><p>My involvement started when I met a gravely ill group of sarcoma patients who had set up a support group and this is one of first issues that I lobbied on as a new Senator in 2016.  We managed to secure a meeting with the Minister for Health that summer.  Lo and behold who comes in behind him, whom we had not invited, only a troupe of personnel or top dogs from St. Vincent's hospital.  These people tried to answer for the Minister but he was there to answer to sick patients, many of whom have died since.  <\/p><p>I seek clarity on three issues.  What is the Minister of State's stance on publicly funded hospitals applying their own recruitment policies that have damaging consequences for patients?  Why was a temporary contract not offered to cover the period of more than two years since the departure of the last sarcoma specialist?

That is what I will address, if that is okay with the House.  <\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for the opportunity to update the House on the matter.  I am advised that the person recruited to fill a permanent post of consultant medical oncologist, with a special interest in sarcoma, at St. Vincent's University Hospital will commence on 1 September 2019.<\/p> <p>More than 200 adults are diagnosed with some form of sarcoma every year in Ireland.  For patients with a new sarcoma diagnosis, it is important that decisions on the management of cases are made through a multidisciplinary team process.  Multidisciplinary teams can involve clinicians and other medical personnel, as well as health and social care professionals, based in several hospitals.<\/p> <p>The outputs of their deliberations provide recommendations on the best approach to investigations, treatment and follow-up for the individual patient.  Services for patients with sarcoma are currently provided in St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, and in Cork University Hospital.  Both hospitals are designated cancer centres and have an extensive range of multidisciplinary services and expert clinical advice available.<\/p> <p>A national clinical lead in soft tissue sarcomas is in place to oversee services for patients.  Patients have their cases presented and discussed at one of the two sarcoma multidisciplinary teams and members of these teams have links with European specialists in sarcoma.<\/p> <p>This Government and the HSE are committed to providing a high quality, responsive and sustainable service for sarcoma patients.  St. Vincent's hospital has access to all of the relevant specialties for treatment, including surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology and pathology.<\/p> <p>The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 sets out the plan for the development of cancer services for the next decade.  Effective prevention, early diagnosis, access to quality treatment, survivorship, patient involvement and safe high quality patient-centred care are key aims of the strategy.  Services for rare cancers such as sarcoma received considerable attention in the development of the strategy.  The importance of improving awareness of rare cancers among both the public and healthcare practitioners is acknowledged.  Furthermore, the strategy sets out the need for clear care pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with rare cancers, with particular emphasis on timely treatment planning in multidisciplinary teams, sub-specialty expertise in diagnosis and treatment, and linkages to international centres of excellence for specialist advice and intervention.  There is a particular focus on the co-ordination of care in an expert setting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#E00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comments but he has chastised me by suggesting ways for me to table questions.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Health knows the details and history behind this matter.

I thank the Dominicans, the De La Salle Brothers and the Sisters of Charity for their 60-year contribution to education in Ballyfermot.  They have made serious strides and progression rates to third level education have increased by up to 50%.  We are in changing times and there is a shift towards co-education schools.  Ballyfermot is a settled area.  Three schools will merge into one and this school will require investment, including in gym, science and technology facilities.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Education and Skills the need for continuity of service.  The lands are available and only require capital investment.<\/p><p>The second issue I raise is also related to a secondary school.  It is in a different part of Dublin, namely, the Harold's Cross area, in Dublin 6W.  The Department of Education and Skills has excluded Dublin 12 from the patronage survey of this school and children from the Dublin 12 area will be excluded from accessing the school.  An Educate Together group comprising parents in the Dublin 8 and 12 areas has met and has a great deal of public support.  There is an urgent need for a co-educational non-denominational school in this area.  The committee of this school has found it very difficult to get a meeting with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister to meet the committee of the Educate Together school.<\/p><p>My final point is on a good news story.  I congratulate the Assumption secondary  school in Walkinstown which topped the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>school league table and was named the most improved school in the country.  This is an all-girls school in Walkinstown and 100% of the students last year went on to third level education.  That is a major step and I congratulate the principal, Siobh&aacute;in Hoey, her staff and all the girls in the school.

This morning at 10 a.m., the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government launched its report examining the potential impacts of Brexit on Ireland's housing market.  I acknowledge the enormous amount of work done by Deputy Maria Bailey, the Chairman of the committee on which all political groups in the House are represented.  It is an important report and I urge people to pick up a copy today.  I believe copies are being printed.  The report was launched in the audiovisual room at which there was a very good attendance.  There was also a good deal of media interest in it.<\/p> <p>I will focus on one of the key points, namely, the issue of encouraging skilled crafts people to return to this country.  One of the main issues highlighted in the report, which became very clear from the contributions of stakeholders and others who came before the committee, was the shortage of skilled workers in the economy.  Another problem is that some people who wish to return are unable to do so because renting accommodation is so difficult.<\/p> <p>We need to attract skilled workers, be they plasterers, plumbers, electricians, engineers or architects, to this country to put their shoulder to the wheel as we implement Rebuilding Ireland and address the housing crisis, including the lack of social and affordable homes, and problems in the construction sector.  That is one of the report's 14 strong recommendations.<\/p> <p>The other side of that is how we can crank up apprenticeships and what many of us would have known as the vocational education model.  This is a very good model as it allows young people aged 16 or 17 who are interested to start apprenticeships and develop skills.  How can we support young men and women who want to take on a trade and feed into what will be a major challenge in terms of Rebuilding Ireland and building homes for people.  All of that is addressed in one of the 14 key recommendations in this report.  The Leader has expressed views on this issue previously.  As we get Brexit ready, perhaps this would be an opportune time to debate the report in the House.  There are many facets to Brexit and it will present challenges for agriculture, forestry, the construction sector and so on.  In the coming weeks., we might debate aspects of these challenges, including this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#G00600","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will begin by referring briefly to the nurses' dispute about which much has been said.

There is a route map to a solution which has been spelled out by ICTU and the significance of ICTU saying that seems to have been completely missed by the Government parties as to how this issue can be dealt within the existing agreement.<\/p><p>The last point I will make on the nurses' dispute, and which needs to be recognised, is that if it is allowed to go into next week, it will never be forgiven and never be forgotten.  To close down our health service for three days next week is entirely up to the response of the Government.  It has very little time to get this right.<\/p><p>I wish to refer to Catalonia.  Next Tuesday, after having been in arbitrary pre-trial detention for more than 14 months, nine Catalan political prisoners, including six former members of the Catalan Government, the former Speaker of Parliament and two civil society leaders, are facing a long trial before the Spanish Supreme Court.  They face the grave charges of rebellion, disobedience and embezzlement of public funds.  I ask for a debate on Catalonia because of the importance of what is going on there.<\/p><p>Their crime was to have organised or supported a referendum on self-determination, in line with the democratic mandate given to them by the Catalan people.  They now risk a prison sentence of up to 25 years, since the crime of rebellion, which involves a \"violent and public uprising\" according to Spanish law, is one of the most serious crimes in the Spanish criminal code.  Yet the undeniable truth is that they did not use or incite any violence, as accepted by the German court which turned down the extradition of former Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont.  Indeed, the only violence came from the brutal and shameful police response that left more than 1,000 injured voters.  Police officers beating peaceful people trying to cast their ballot is an image we never again want to see in Europe.<\/p><p>Together with members of the EU-Catalonia dialogue platform in the European Parliament, I regret the repressive and judicial response of the Spanish authorities to a conflict that is political in nature.  I reject the false narrative behind the accusations and I denounce the fact that this trial is a political trial.  Dialogue and negotiation, not imprisonment and criminal prosecution, should have been the instruments through which Catalonia's legitimate and democratic right to self-determination ought to have been channelled.  This political trial is not only an internal Spanish affair, it has a clear European dimension since it clashes with the fundamental values of democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and the right to political participation.  Even the right to a fair trial is at stake, since the political prisoners have denounced numerous irregularities during the pre-trial phase.  For instance, most of their appeals against their pre-trial imprisonment brought before the Spanish constitutional court are pending, thereby blocking their access to the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p>We should all be watching this political trial closely.  Catalans have a legitimate right to democratically decide their own political future and Madrid and Brussels need politicians with the courage to settle political conflicts not with criminal charges but with the tools of democracy.  This trial will not contribute to a reasonable solution to the historical tensions between Catalonia and the institutions of Spain.  The Irish Government should not be silent on this issue and instead should work to ensure that a political and democratic solution may be reached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#G00900","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Last week during the Order of Business I drew attention to two reports, namely, the report on the inquest into the Carrickmines fire and the report of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Committee of Social Rights.

It does cover issues in a way that mainstream Dublin-based media fail to do.<\/p> <p>In a schoolroom setting, different children have different needs and our education system strives to tailor teaching to the needs of children as well as possible.  I am chair of a school board of management in east Galway and I am aware of the issues that can arise.  Children with Down's syndrome are loved and cherished by their families, school friends and teachers and they have particular needs that we have to ensure are addressed.  Last week, Down Syndrome Ireland gave an interesting presentation to Oireachtas Members about educational resources for children with Down's syndrome.  It provided detail on the latest research into new educational approaches which can allow Down's syndrome children to get the education they need within streamlined classrooms alongside their friends and peers.  Down Syndrome Ireland and their friends are looking for the Government to adequately resource and roll out a national training programme for teachers in mainstream schools.  They outlined a number of teaching approaches, including the use of specialised materials, varying the pace of lessons and learning, creating classroom groups according to the abilities of the various students and lessons that are differentiated based on the needs of the students involved.<\/p> <p>The July provision scheme, operated by the Department of Education and Skills, provides for an extension of the school year for children with a severe or profound learning disability or autism, either in the school or in the home.  We can all understand how an excessively long summer holiday can impact on the ability of children with particular needs to retain what they have learned but the vast majority of children with Down's syndrome do not qualify for the scheme at present.  They all should qualify because that would allow them to have additional structure on their education and help them keep up with their friends and peers.<\/p> <p>Individual education plans outline the specific learning goals to be achieved by a student with special needs and can be achieved through resourcing and teaching methods to create a better learning environment.  According to Down Syndrome Ireland, the ASTI and the TUI have advised their members to stop providing these plans due to inadequate resourcing, which is a very worrying development.  I ask the Leader to agree that these are issues which deserve support from this House and from Government and I ask him to facilitate an early debate on this very important area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#J03000","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Nurses and midwives will be joined in industrial action next week by psychiatric nurses, which will bring the total to 50,000 nurses.

There is a one billion plus company called HID Global which has a base in Inverin in Connemara with more than 100 employees.  It announced yesterday that it is moving to the far side of Galway city.  As the Minister knows, 100 jobs in rural Ireland are critically important.  This is a big hit to the Cois Fharraige area.  The vast majority of those employees are native Irish speakers and we have a plean Gaeilge asking people to speak Irish more frequently.  I have repeatedly stood up in this House to say not to ask people to speak more Irish but instead give them a chance to work in their locality.  It is about jobs.  More Irish is being spoken in Dorchester Avenue in Boston than there is in Lettermore or Carraroe.  HID Global is a world leader in IT technology.  I do not know why it is moving into Galway city.  There is a huge unemployment rate in rural Ireland and in the Cois Fharraige area.  Was there an offer from the IDA for the company to move to Galway city?<\/p> <p>I am a huge supporter of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  It works tirelessly to try to get, and to keep, employment in the Gaeltacht regions of rural Ireland.  It is a dangerous precedent that a company is moving from an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s area in rural Ireland to the far side of Galway city.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to come to the House to make a statement and to debate this.  I am pleading with the Government not to let rural Ireland die because it is dying.  We are all on the one team.  We need to support businesses and employment in rural Ireland.  The last thing we want is to lose a substantial company like this one to the east side of Galway city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#K00400","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Down Syndrome Ireland for its informative event in the audio-visual room last week.  I agree with one of the previous speakers about the July provision.  It is something I have raised here in a Commencement debate.  Children with Down Syndrome are not accepted under the July provision.  For those who do not know, the July provision is an opportunity to go to school in the month of July to get extra support.  It is certainly something these children and their families rely on.  During that Commencement debate, I was informed that a review was ongoing in the Department.  Children with Down's syndrome do not come under the remit of the July provision, yet children with autism do.  It is a shame they do not come under its remit.  We need the Minister to come to the House to discuss this matter as soon as possible because many families rely on the July provision.

Let us not forget that this inflammatory language has been used before and also reference was made to the comments by Ms Priti Patel, MP, to the effect that there will be food shortages in Ireland.  Ms Patel's comments were completely derogatory and derisory.  To put the matter in context, this is all borne out of frustration on the part of both the EU 27 and the UK.  I do not believe it is anything more sinister than that.  We need to be careful that the quotation is seen in context.  We saw evidence yesterday where the quotation in question was taken out of context and not in its entirety.  That actually changes the quotation significantly.  The blame game, finger pointing and colourful language does not add to this debate.  We are in a situation where every man, woman and child in the land is an expert on Brexit.  That is dangerous.<\/p> <p>Today marks a significant milestone.  It is 50 days until 29 March.  There will be 32 sitting days in that period.  Time is rapidly running out.  Prime Minister May was in Belfast on two days this week and some cynics would be forgiven for wondering what she achieved or what was the purpose of her visit.  However, there were a number of significant points.  Mrs. May stated, \"The need for change is to the backstop is the key issue and not the need to get rid of the backstop.\".  She also explicitly stated, \"The UK stands by her commitment in the joint report that there will be no hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks or controls.\"  She further stated, \"neither will I compromise on my promise to protect Northern Ireland's integral place in the UK.\"<\/p> <p>Technology can deliver at some point, but that point is not now.  Yesterday, we learned from the British tabloids of a solution put forward by Fujitsu to deal with the Border conundrum whereby a web portal linked to a mobile app, supplemented by GPS and artificial intelligence and using geo-fencing technology - potentially using number plate recognition - could identify vehicles, traders, tourist traffic and redirect anything of concern to a customs depot.  Could surveillance on the Border and on approved roads and redirection to customs depots could work or would it be a totally regressive step after 20 years of seamless frictionless trade across this island.  The Prime Minister's comments are certainly reassuring but it is possible to square this circle?  Is it the case that any agreement reached can be all things to all people?  This is the time for cool heads and strong leadership.  Tensions between the UK and Ireland are emerging because we all know that the retention of trade links and a strong healthy relationship are critically important.  After two years of negotiations during which everyone involved contributed to delivering solutions to problems, the deal on the table is arguably as good as it gets.  All must work together to reflect, review and assess where matters stand.  Decisions in the next few weeks will have an impact for years to come.  Strong leadership is often about listening to others and an ability to recognise that one may have got it wrong.  Democracy dictates that one has the freedom to change one's mind.  I am of the view that some people may have done so.  I urge Mrs. May to respect the vote, respect the people and let them support Government by validating the referendum result.  Is Brexit really what they want and is it really the right thing to do?  I am not sure that it is.  When he meets Prime Minister May tomorrow, I ask that the Taoiseach respectfully remind her that if any doubt exists about leaving the EU, then it is her duty to demonstrate strong leadership, to reconsider and to establish - two years on - whether this is still the right things for the UK to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#L00400","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#L00500","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Before calling Senator Lombard, I would like to welcome to the Public Gallery Mr. John O'Sullivan and also colleagues of Senator Devine from the Psychiatric Nurses Association and the INMO.

I also want to remedy and remediate the indiscretion in that regard.  I wanted to ensure that it would be procedurally possible for the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to continue with its proposed stakeholder engagement once the Bill had been introduced in this House.  The joint committee has decided that such an engagement will commence once the Bill completes its progress through the Seanad.  I understand that it will be procedurally possible to do this before the debate on the in the D&aacute;il commences.  This is priority legislation that will strengthen the regulatory framework for further and higher education, as well as for the English language sector.  Therefore, I hope Members from all parties will co-operate to ensure that the stakeholder engagement does not result in any delay to the progress of the Bill.<\/p> <p>I am very pleased to be back here having had the debate during the previous session.  When this Bill was last before the House, it was just days after the closure of Grafton College.  This closure highlighted issues surrounding employment practices in the English language education sector.  I wish to provide the House with a brief update on developments relating to this provider since last December.  I can report that those learners who were enrolled in Grafton College at the time of its closure have now been transferred to other schools in order to complete their courses.  This was achieved under learner protection arrangements put in place by Marketing English Ireland, MEI.  I thank MEI and its members alongside the staff of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and the Department of Justice and Equality for their efforts in supporting these students.  I have been informed that a liquidator has been appointed in respect of Grafton College and that this case now has the status of a formal insolvency arrangement.  In such cases, it is the responsibility of the liquidator to make applications on behalf of employees for payments from the redundancy payments scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of wage-related entitlements.  Employees of Grafton College should direct queries in this regard to the appointed liquidator, which is happening.<\/p> <p>One of the key objectives in bringing forward this legislation was to ensure that Ireland has an English language sector in which we can all have confidence and which provides a quality education to international students coming here to learn English.  There is no doubt that teachers and staff in this sector are a central element in ensuring the quality of that educational provision.  I made a commitment in December to appoint an experienced mediator to meet the bodies representing employers and employees in the English language education sector to explore the potential for a set of minimum employment standards that could be agreed for the English language sector.  Last month, I formally appointed Mr. Patrick King, the former general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, to this role and issued invitations to the various stakeholders from the sector to engage in this process.  Mr. King has met with a number of these stakeholders, including trade union representatives, to discuss and identify the key issues impacting the sector.  I encourage all relevant stakeholders, particularly providers, to engage meaningfully in this process.  It is in all our interests to strengthen the quality of English language provision in Ireland.  This is something I am committed to achieving.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> When we last debated the issue of employment practices in the English language sector I accepted the principle behind what Senators were aiming to achieve with their amendments in this area.  We are all in agreement that situations such as that with respect to Grafton College should not occur and that English language teachers should not go without pay or be prevented from accessing the full suite of employment rights supported by the State.  My primary concern is that any proposals to involve QQI in employment right issues would be consistent with the existing legal framework and consistent with QQI's regulatory remit.  Otherwise, such proposals will be unworkable and open to challenge.  <\/p><p>I accept the principle of the Labour Party amendment that has been accepted by this House.  It provides that the codes of practice that providers will need to comply with to become eligible for the international education mark, IEM, will include criteria relating to compliance with quality standards for the recruitment, employment and necessitation of employment of employees, and with employment law generally.  It further provides that in establishing requirements in these areas QQI shall consult with trade unions or staff associations that represent the employees of these providers.  As I mentioned, I fully accept the principle behind the Labour Party amendment.

This is provided for in the amended section 65(3), which enables QQI to determine when the annual charge will be paid by a specific class to the provider.  QQI will have the flexibility to engage with providers to determine a suitable date and the structure of that payment of this charge.  I hope that satisfies the Senator on that point.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 78, which she has raised, it is important to note that the annual charge applied to QQI will vary between providers due to the variety of factors and the criteria set out in the Bill.

However, in response to amendment No. 70, I tabled amendment No. 74 which will exempt Marino Institute of Education and Mary Immaculate College.  Senator Byrne raised the issue of Mary Immaculate College on Second Stage.  The institutions are principally publicly funded and amendments Nos. 72, 74 and 75 correct their omission from the original list of exempted bodies.  However, I cannot accept amendment No. 71 relating to the IPA at this time, although there is merit to the proposal.  In order to be consistent with the other bodies that are exempted from the fund, I ask Senator Ruane to allow me and my officials time to consider it further.  It is my intention to return with an amendment in this regard on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>I cannot accept amendment No. 73 which proposes to exempt not-for-profit community education providers from the learner protection fund because there is no obligation on providers to engage with QQI.  It is only if providers wish to have their programmes validated by QQI that they may have to contribute to the learner protection fund.  The community and voluntary sector is not a homogenous group.  QQI currently has approximately 130 providers which have self-declared as community and voluntary.  It is a very diverse group of providers with an equally diverse cohort of learners.  Some self-declared community and voluntary providers operate on a for-profit commercial basis and charge fees to students for programmes.  Protection for enrolled learner measures are necessary to ensure that the payments made by students are safeguarded in these cases.  Some community and voluntary providers will automatically be exempt from paying into the fund.  The QQI has advised that approximately 25% of its providers in this category only deliver programmes up to level 3 on the national qualifications framework.  These tend to be short programmes of less than three months duration.  Similarly, any programmes in respect of which moneys are not paid on behalf of a learner will be exempt from the fund.  This would include, for example, programmes that are publicly funded by the Exchequer such back to work schemes or upskilling programmes offered by education and training boards.  It is the intention that the protection of enrolled learners fund charge will only apply in circumstances where a provider accepts moneys from or on behalf of a learner in respect of a programme with a minimum duration of three months.  The learner protection fund charge will be developed by QQI in consultation with all relevant stakeholders against a set of criteria, including the number of learners enrolled on the programme, the level of the fees charged by the providers and the risk weighting.  I indicated earlier that QQI will specifically be asked to consult with providers before the level of payment into the fund is agreed.  I assure Senator Ruane and other Senators that I fully appreciate and strongly support the valuable role played by the community and the voluntary sector in providing education and training opportunities to marginalised communities, as demonstrated by the very significant funding resources provided to the community and voluntary sector to undertake these important training and education activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#R00600","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 71:<\/p><blockquote>In page 37, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:&ldquo;(n) the Institute of Public Administration,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#R00800","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 72:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 73:<\/p><blockquote>In page 37, line 26, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;(o) not-for-profit community education providers, or&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#R01200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 74:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 75:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549535400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 76 in the name of Senator Ruane has been discussed with amendment No. 70.

Why then did we restrict the college from calling itself a university within this State?  The anomaly seems odd and I am sure it is unhelpful to the college, particularly abroad.  The use of the term &quot;university&quot; is not one that is conferred casually, and rightly so.  There is ample evidence that the RCSI more than meets its exacting educational standards.  The college is an international leader in supporting healthcare professionals through high quality education, research and service.  We should remove any impediments that will prevent it from continuing its work and, ultimately, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.  I, therefore, support the amendment.  I also support the call made by Senator Reilly that this matter must be addressed within this House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#S00600","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in does not support the amendment.  We recognise the important work of the RCSI and applaud its staff for the service that they provide by training surgeons, who work in our hospitals, as well as students who are spread all across the world.  However, we have concerns.<\/p> <p>We must remember that the RCSI has a campus in Bahrain where widespread human rights abuses have taken place in hospitals in which RCSI students receive training.  Ceartas - Irish Lawyers for Human Rights has called on the Irish Medical Council to not approve the RCSI Bahrain campus for accreditation because of these widespread abuses carried out by the autocratic and sectarian regime that rules Bahrain with an iron fist.  Many former students of RCSI Bahrain have been arrested, tortured and imprisoned because they treated victims of the regime's security services.  They simply did what was demanded of them by their Hippocratic oath yet Bahrain continues to violate their medical neutrality.  Most relevant to the amendment is the fact that the RCSI has refused to condemn the regime for such actions.  Ceartas has plainly stated that RCSI Bahrain has \"an education programme integrated with health systems connected to torture, discriminatory conduct in the provision of healthcare and employment of medical staff, and consistent violation of the rights to freedom of expression\".  We are deeply concerned about the RCSI's connection to this brutal regime and that this name change would grant legitimacy to the campus in Bahrain.  We are, therefore, not be in a position to support this amendment.<\/p> <p>We would, however, like the Minister to comment on a couple of related questions.  If this amendment were to pass, and the title of RCSI was amended to include university, would there be any change to the status of the employees?  Would they become public servants similar to those employed in other Irish universities or is it simply a change in title rather than a change in structure? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#S00700","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I am sure all Members will join in the condemnation of human rights abuses in Bahrain and urge the Government to express its concerns and the concerns of everybody in this House regarding human rights abuses in Bahrain.

My understanding is, and thanks to the work of my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and officials in the Department of Education and Skills, that the RCSI can promote itself and refer to itself as a university abroad but not in Ireland, which goes to the heart of the matter.  This is a ridiculously anomalous situation that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>I have led many trade missions, for example, to various parts of the globe and I was often accompanied by leading figures in the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices sector.  It was rare that I did not meet somebody who was trained in the RCSI and who benefitted greatly from that.  The work they have done has greatly benefitted the states in which they live and serve as medical professionals.  We are all very proud of the work that the RCSI has done, and continues to do, in this country.  Significant investment has been undertaken by the RCSI in its facility and further significant investment is planned to expand the services provided by the college.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We can be proud of what the RCSI does here in Ireland.

I also thank the ten Senators who put their names to the proposed amendment.  To single out one, Senator James Reilly has me haunted on this issue, but I thank them all for the work they have done.<\/p> <p>Members will know from the discussion of these issues on Second Stage, the proposed use of the title \"University\" in the State by RCSI has arisen on several occasions over a number of years.  From having visited the RCSI in Ireland on many occasions, my engagement with staff and students and my knowledge of its international activities, I am very conscious of its unique contribution to the higher education system, the Irish health system and, indeed, Irish society more generally.  It is a statutory body and a statutory degree-awarding institution.  It has established an outstanding reputation internationally and in Ireland, as mentioned by Senator McFadden, for the quality of the education and training it provides, as well as excellence in research and service to society.  I share the sentiments expressed by the ten Senators and the speakers in the House today in regard to the high status and reputation of RCSI, and its performance in terms of certain key characteristics of a university, including, for example, the levels of degrees awarded and its research capability, external accreditation and internal governance.<\/p> <p>In terms of the specific amendment proposed, I should state I share the objective the Senators are seeking to achieve.  As was the case with the issue which arose previously in the context of the Technological Universities Bill 2015, a key issue is ensuring that we put in place a legally sound mechanism for responding to and resolving this issue.  In summary, the advice of the Office of the Attorney General to date is that providing access to the title \"University\" in the manner proposed is not legally robust.  There are already legislative frameworks in place for the recognition of certain higher education institutions as universities.  If we are going to extend the categories of institution which can be recognised as a university, there must be a clear and objective basis for this in legislation, namely, to ensure the maintenance of proper standards, to ensure we treat everyone fairly and to safeguard against the risk of a legal challenge which places a burden on the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>The Universities Act 1997 and the Technological Universities Act 2018 provide the current legislative frameworks.  Suitable amendments would be needed to ensure that any new pathway for recognition as a university is legally sound and that all necessary principles and policies are set out in the legislation to guide the decision maker.  As the RCSI is not a publicly-funded higher education institution in the sense of being dependent on public funding, it would not be appropriate for it to be subject to the detailed governance rules in place under the two aforementioned Acts.  In this context, my Department has been working closely in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to explore whether an alternative legislative approach can be found to enable university recognition other than as currently provided for in the 1997 and 2018 Acts.   The Department has had significant and constructive engagement with the RCSI on this matter.  I am confident it will be possible on Report Stage for me to come to this House to present an amendment that meets the relevant legal and policy objectives.<\/p> <p>In summary, I intend if at all possible to bring in an amendment on Report Stage in this House with the objective of putting in place a process to address the issue of university status for RCSI.  On Report Stage, I hope we will provide a mechanism whereby a higher education institution with statutory degree-awarding powers and an established reputation for excellence and achievement in higher education provision, research and service to society can apply for authorisation from the Minister of the day to describe itself as a university.  The amendment I have in mind would require the institution to make an application to the Minister.  It would provide for an independent evaluation process to inform the Minister in evaluating the application and, of course, for the grant or refusal of authorisation by the Minister.  In these circumstances, I do not believe it is necessary for Senators to press the amendment.  As I have said, I will in any event be proposing a detailed, comprehensive and equitable substitute amendment, which I expect to happen on Report Stage in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020700002#T00300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1549535400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comments.

Second, I would echo Senator Nash's point that there is no one in this House who would not condemn outright the human rights abuses that take place, not just in Bahrain but around the world.
