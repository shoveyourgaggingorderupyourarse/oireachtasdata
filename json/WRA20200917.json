Questions Nos. 51 and 59 together.<\/p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI)\u00a0under a contract signed\u00a0last November. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. <\/p><p>Under the NBP\u00a0deployment plan\u00a0premises will be\u00a0passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have\u00a0access to high speed broadband within the next four years. Nursing homes, within the intervention area, will be among the many premises which will benefit from the\u00a0roll out of the National Broadband Plan\u00a0which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.<\/p><p>Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 20 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and laying fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. <\/p><p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.<\/p><p>  The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700073#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700073#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[24468\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700073#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will address the need for a retrofit scheme in section 38 and 39 charities and small and medium approved housing bodies and other items (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1593","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets for the number and depth of residential retrofits to be completed by 2030.

The Scheme has been in existence since 2002 and has provided upgrades to over 142,000 homes, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <\/p><p>Eligibility for Fuel Allowance is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (<i>www.deasp.ie<\/i>). At present a Person Supported by the Service (PSS) is not entitled to Fuel Allowance, which is one of the criteria for eligibility for the Warmer Homes scheme. However, the Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need, including eligibility criteria. Recommendations in relation to the implementation of changes to the scheme will be finalised shortly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Deputy may also note that the properties referred to in his question may be eligible to receive support for upgrade works under the Better Energy Communities Scheme which is another scheme administered by SEAI.\u00a0 The Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers.

For example, it includes employees that were not previously eligible for the TWSS, such as seasonal workers and new hires, and applications for such workers under the EWSS may be backdated to 1 July 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, so it is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated.\u00a0 At the same time,\u00a0it is recognised that\u00a0economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the\u00a0Government\u00a0remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 15 September 2020, there were 33,348 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the whole duration of that scheme. As a result, there are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS. \u00a0However, I can confirm to the Deputies that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months.

In 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for\u00a0additional resources.\u00a0 This\u00a0reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer complete an application process annually to apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for an assessment or diagnosis from external professionals.<\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department delivers a tiered, consultative model of service. Schools are supported to put in place a continuum of support which encompasses, universal best practices for all, early and targeted intervention for some pupils at risk and more intensive and individualised supports for pupils with more complex and enduring needs. NEPS supports schools at a system level in relation to best practices at each level and provides an individual casework response for those with the greatest needs. In this model the school takes responsibility for initial identification, assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with emerging difficulties including those with developmental delay. Where, following initial school based intervention, difficulties persist or a pupil is not making the expected progress, they may request the involvement of a NEPS psychologist to assist with further assessment and intervention planning and monitoring for the pupil. This system allows psychologists to build capacity at school community level while giving early attention to the most complex cases. This model aims to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of this pandemic my Department has been proactive in supporting schools through the development of advice and guidance to support the wellbeing of school communities. \u00a0\u00a0On the ground at local level NEPS has continued to remotely deliver\u00a0 a psychological service to schools which has included to the extent possible continuance of support and advice in relation to concerns regarding individual pupils.\u00a0 As schools reopen\u00a0 NEPS psychologists will continue to work directly with schools at local level to identify and respond to priority needs including individual casework. \u00a0In Phase 1 (first half term) of the return to school NEPS is providing a service to all schools with a focus on wellbeing. NEPS psychologists are connecting with each school, listening to their needs and engaging in initial planning with schools on how best to respond. It is important that children and young people are supported to experience a successful transition back to school, recognising that transition is a process over time rather than a once-off event. In order to support needs an additional 17 NEPS psychologists are being appointed and will be deployed nationally. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700076#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700076#WRF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[24464\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700076#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if school transport for a child (details supplied) will be reviewed; the status of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.\u00a0In the 2019\/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Department's Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than\u00a03.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest school\u00a0as determined by my Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. <\/p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment\u00a0process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020\/21 school year\u00a0where such services are in operation.<\/p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann,\u00a0who operate school transport on behalf of my Department, has advised that the child referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for school transport under the terms of my Department's Primary School Transport Scheme as they are not attending their closest school.

This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.\u00a0 But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. \u00a0<\/p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.\u00a0 This\u00a0standardising\u00a0process\u00a0happens every year and\u00a0would\u00a0have happened\u00a0in 2020\u00a0had\u00a0the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.\u00a0 The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.\u00a0 This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The\u00a0overall data\u00a0on\u00a0school estimated marks showed\u00a0that there was a very significant rise\u00a0in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally.\u00a0This\u00a0level\u00a0of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been\u00a0unrealistic.\u00a0For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%.\u00a0Even with the\u00a0standardisation\u00a0process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.<\/p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools\u00a0 his means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.<\/p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.

The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2020 is approximately &euro;919 million.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.   <\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. <\/p>  <p>  The system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  <\/p>  <p>  Current disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple, making the means test for carers the least onerous within the social protection system.  <\/p>  <p>  A couple earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;37,500 (net of PRSI and other allowable deductions) can qualify for maximum payment and, given the tapered withdrawal approach, retain a payment of just under half-rate while earning &euro;49,750.  A single person may retain a full-rate payment while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, and retain a payment of just under half-rate while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.<\/p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households. <\/p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review; however, any changes to scheme criteria would have implications for overall spending and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700077#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700077#WRG03300"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[24510\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700077#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when the interdepartmental review of the community employment schemes will be published.","asker":"1463","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>The Community Employment (CE) programme is a community centred labour market initiative established for the purposes of social inclusion and activation, to help long-term unemployed people and other vulnerable groups to enter the workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment.<\/p><p>In early 2019, the Government agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore how social inclusion schemes might be organised going forward. <\/p><p>A number\u00a0of meetings of the IDG took\u00a0place and a series\u00a0of follow-up meetings were undertaken with the relevant Departments.

The report acknowledges the opportunities provided by digital technology but also highlights some of the risks and vulnerabilities faced by children and young people. It suggests that risks can be minimised by equipping children with the skills and knowledge they need to safely and smartly navigate the online world and by service providers putting proper safeguards in place to protect users. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am very aware of the risks and opportunities that the online world brings, and I am committed to working with my colleagues in a co-ordinated Government response to address issues arising.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.\u00a0 The general scheme of the OSMR Bill 2019, which has the aim of regulating harmful content and creating a safer environment online, was published by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in January 2020. The Bill sets a clear expectation for online platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the users of their service, including children. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner as part of a wider Media Commission to oversee the new regulatory framework for online safety. Online safety codes will deal with a wide range of issues, including measures to be taken by online services to tackle the availability of harmful online content, for example cyberbullying material and material promoting eating disorders, on their services. The Online Safety Commissioner will also have a role in promoting positive digital citizenship among children and young people, in conjunction with Webwise and other educational partners, schools, as well as the Ombudsman for Children. The Commissioner will also develop a research programme led by internationally recognised experts to review the existing and developing literature in relation to the consequences, benefits and potential harms to society and especially children, of digital activity. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19, which was launched by the then Taoiseach in July 2018, recognises that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department and sets out the rage of actions and activities underway across six key Government Departments (Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation) to keep children and adults safe online. <\/p>  <p>  Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan, in January 2019 my Department published an addendum to the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements.\u00a0In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the government response to Covid-19, in April, my Department launched a range of supports for parents and children to support them during this challenging time. This included a new online gov.ie resource for parents, entitled &lsquo;Parents Centre&rsquo;, which brings together high quality information and online resources for parents into one portal.

This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. \u00a0As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. <\/p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. \u00a0I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.<\/p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. \u00a0However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the new Programme for Government,\u00a0Our Shared Future,\u00a0prioritises the implementation of\u00a0the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the four year implementation plan A Policing Service for the Future. \u00a0In its report, published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety.\u00a0 The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. <\/p><p>A key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future is the rollout of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operating Model.\u00a0 The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime.\u00a0 I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.<\/p><p>In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of A Policing Service for the Future will see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act.\u00a0 My Department is progressing work on the preparation of a Policing and Community Safety Bill as a matter of priority. <\/p><p>In addition to setting out a new governance and oversight framework for policing, it will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable, place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety and refine local structures supporting local accountability for policing.\u00a0 In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700078#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700078#WRH03400"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[24471\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700078#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applications made under section 60 of the Coroners Act 1962 since the provision was inserted by the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 (details supplied); the supports or guidelines available to family members wishing to apply under this provision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>Section 30(3)(a) of\u00a0 the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) provides that the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) may establish and maintain a panel of solicitors who are willing to provide legal aid and advice to persons who are in receipt of legal services with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.\u00a0 Following receipt of such consent, in 2015 the Board established and now maintains a panel of solicitors who are willing to provide services to persons who have been granted a legal aid certificate by the Board for the purpose of\u00a0advice and representation in relation to the following categories of cases set out in Section 60(5) of the Coroners Act 1962 (inserted by Section 24(b) of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013):<\/p><p>(a)\u00a0 the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his\u00a0or her death, in the custody of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,<\/p><p>(b)\u00a0 the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his or her death, in custody in a prison within the meaning of section 2 of the Prisons Act 2007,<\/p><p>(c)\u00a0 the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his\u00a0or her death, in service custody within the meaning of section 2 of the Defence Act 1954,<\/p><p>(d)\u00a0 the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his or her death, involuntarily detained under Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001 in an approved centre within the meaning of section 2 of that Act,<\/p><p>(e)\u00a0 the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his or her death, detained in a designated centre within the meaning of section 3 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 or was a person to whom section 20 of that Act refers,<\/p><p>(f)the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his or her death, in custody in a remand centre within the meaning of section 3 of the Children Act 2001 or detained in a children detention school within the meaning of that section,<\/p><p>(g)\u00a0 the deceased was, at the time of his or her death or immediately before his or her death, a child in care, or <\/p><p>(h) the coroner is of the opinion that the death of the deceased occurred in circumstances the continuance or possible recurrence of which would be prejudicial to the health or safety of the public or any section of the public\u00a0such that there is a significant public interest in the family member of the deceased person being granted legal aid or legal advice, or both, for the purposes of the inquest concerned.<\/p><p>Persons seeking legal services in respect of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest\u00a0as provided under section 60(1) of the Coroners Act 1962 must make their applications\u00a0for legal representation to a coroner.

A number of initial priority areas for action have been determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls. These workstreams are currently developing proposals to improve women and girls' health and further updates will be made available on the official Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce webpage: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>Work related to this area is ongoing within HSE. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.

It is prosecuted by two fleets, the main fleet which operates\u00a0across the Celtic Sea\u00a0(primarily ICES division 7g) and the sentinel fleet comprising of vessels that are under 17 metres in length overall that operate in the Dunmore box (inshore waters in Dunmore East area). <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource owned by the State and are made available to fishing vessels based on an overall policy framework which has been developed over the past 30 years.\u00a0The result of this long standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The key commercial whitefish quotas (cod, haddock, monk, hake etc) are managed on a monthly basis with maximum catch limits set for vessels.\u00a0 Pelagic stocks such as mackerel and herring are managed on an annual or seasonal basis with catch limits set based on allocation regimes developed over many years and primarily related to historical catch records.\u00a0\u00a0 The Irish fish quota management system is designed to ensure, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, a fair and rational allocation of quotas between fishing vessel operators and management to support fishing seasons and the availability of by-catch quotas during the year. The management arrangements have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the introduction of quotas.\u00a0\u00a0 Any amendments or changes to the policy on management arrangements are determined by the Minister of the time following\u00a0detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Within the policy, allocations and other arrangements are decided by the Minister on an ongoing basis having regard for the advice of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) and, for the Celtic\u00a0Sea herring fishery, the Celtic\u00a0Sea Herring Management Advisory\u00a0Committee (CSHMAC) which was set up in 2005 to provide advice to the Minister in relation to the management of the Celtic Sea Herring Stock and fishery within the policy framework set by the Minister.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee is comprised of representatives from the four Fish Producer Organisations, the Fish Co-Ops and Processors and, since 2016, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF).\u00a0 The Committee meets at relevant intervals during the year to discuss issues of concern to the fishery such as scientific advice regarding the state of the stock and also proposals in relation to future management arrangements within the Minister's policy. <\/p>  <p>  The Celtic Sea Herring stock is at one of its lowest stock levels since 1958 and the ICES advice for 2020 was for zero catch. In 2019, the European Commission submitted a special request to ICES to &ldquo;provide advice on the minimum level of catches (tonnage) required in a sentinel fishery, which would provide sufficient data for ICES in order to continue providing scientific advice on the state of this stock&rdquo;.

The Government is committed to reform of the planning and appeals processes as set out in the Programme for Government and we have presented draft legislation to this effect which I expect to be presenting to the House in due course. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.<\/p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project. This plan is already yielding progress with felling licences issued in August the highest in the previous 13 months in both volume and area.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this plan a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced which aims to increase efficiencies in the appeals process. I very much welcome the almost 9,000 submissions on the Bill which we are now reviewing in advance of presenting the Bill to the House for consideration in the very near future.<\/p>  <p>  While it is the objective of my Department to issue tree felling licences within four months from the date advertised, now most applications are not issued within this timeframe.  Applications for forestry licences cannot be issued within the first 30 days to allow for public consultation.  Furthermore, once a decision is issued, the licensee must wait 28 days before commencing any forestry operations to allow for appeals.  It is the aim of my Department to return to issuing most tree felling licences, within given objectives, through the procedures set out in the project plan as set out above.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700082#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tuberculosis Eradication Programme","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700082#WRM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[24548\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700082#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of farmers with C10 herds who have been advised to cull cattle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[24549\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700082#WRM02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of cattle farmers have been advised to cull from categories C1 to C10; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

According to CSO data, the average farm size has remained relatively stable over the past decade or more with the average farm size of 32.7 hectares in 2010, 32.5 hectares in 2013 and 32.4 hectares in 2016. Over the same period, the number of farm holdings has also remained relatively stable with 139,860 farms recorded by the CSO in 2010, 139,600 in 2013 and 137,500 in 2016. In the 2016 FSS, the CSO indicated that of the 137,500 farms in Ireland, 137,100 (99.7%) were classified as family farms and that almost 43% of farms in Ireland were less than 20 hectares in size.<\/p>  <p>  Water quality in Ireland is generally considered in good health.\u00a0However, the latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water Quality in Ireland Report has identified a further decline in some catchments. Ireland has a regulatory framework for the protection of water by nutrient losses through the Nitrates Directive and the Nitrates Action Programme. Ireland's current Nitrates Action Programme concludes in 2021 and the process of reviewing the Nitrates regulations and derogation will commence soon and will be subject to consultation with all stakeholders. There is a commitment, and most importantly, a plan in place to reduce losses of nutrients from agricultural sources. <\/p>  <p>  I would accept that there is a significant climate challenge facing society globally, and agriculture must do its share to respond to this challenge. The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Every sector is expected to contribute to meeting this target by implementing policy changes, and the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, will be fully recognised in plans to achieve these targets. The agri-food sector has a strong foundation on which it can build to develop new practices, technologies and strategies to reduce its emissions. Many of these will also have co-benefits in terms of improving the productivity and efficiency of agri-food businesses, and indeed in terms of other environmental co-benefits. Taking a system wide approach can thus improve their environmental, economic and social sustainability<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the enormity of this challenge for the sector and for this reason, I believe that the successor strategy to Food Wise 2025 can play an important role in providing a framework for helping to realise this ambition. The Stakeholder Committee established to develop the new Strategy to 2030 are currently carrying out their deliberations. Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. I have already met with the Committee itself and I am satisfied that their work will make a very important contribution to ensuring the sustainability and viability of the agri-food sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has committed to publishing the new strategy within six months of Government formation. It also stated that the strategy should provide an ambitious blueprint for the industry for the years ahead, adding value sustainably in the agri-food sector into the future, and supporting family farms and employment in rural Ireland. There is also a commitment to ensure that, in addition to growing international markets and value-added export as a key priority, a strategic focus of the strategy will be on environmental protection, reversing biodiversity decline and developing additional market opportunities for primary producers, closer to home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700082#WRM05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700083#WRN00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Projects","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700083#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[24534\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700083#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if feasibility study funding will be provided for a strategic project (details supplied) in County Kerry; when a decision will be announced in relation to the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>My Department does not appear to have received an application from the project in question.\u00a0 <\/p><p>If the Deputy wishes to provide my office with further details of the application and the programme under which\u00a0the application was made, I will be happy to look further into the Deputy's query.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700083#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Services Programme","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700083#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[24538\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091700083#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if there is a review of the community services programme ongoing; if so, when it will be concluded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Community Services Programme, or CSP,\u00a0supports\u00a0more than\u00a0400 community organisations, to provide local services through a social enterprise model with funding provided as a contribution to the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) and a manager, where warranted.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, Indecon International Economic Consultants were commissioned by my Department\u00a0to carry out\u00a0an independent review of the Programme which has been completed.\u00a0The\u00a0final report has been received by my Department\u00a0and is\u00a0under currently under\u00a0consideration.

Initial funding of &euro;315m was secured over the period 2019 to 2022.\u00a0 This represents an unprecedented commitment by Government to strengthen our rural economies and communities.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, since its establishment, my Department has also relaunched the Local Improvement Scheme for private rural roads and laneways. <\/p><p>My Department's\u00a0policy\u00a0provides, for both urban and rural areas nationwide,\u00a0an integrated and strategic way of delivering supports, programmes and schemes, \u00a0coordinating measures to address imbalances or lack of opportunity,\u00a0\u00a0making a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  <b>Those policies include:<\/b><\/p><p>The <b>1st\u00a0National Policy on Social Enterprise published\u00a0in 2019.<\/b>Social enterprises play an important role in creating jobs, in investing in people, and in supporting communities.<\/p><p><b>The Strategy to Support the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Sector in Ireland Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities<\/b>sets out a long-term vision for our communities in Ireland. The Strategy sets a general direction for Government policy in relation to community development, local development and the community and voluntary sectors for the next five years and beyond. I was delighted funding in the 2020 Budget Allocations supports the implementation of the actions detailed in the Strategy.\u00a0 This will include enhanced supports for the structures which drive local engagement in decision making &ndash; the Public Participation Networks and the Local Community Development Committees.<\/p><p><b>The Forthcoming Policy for Rural Development 2020-2025 builds<\/b>on the Action Plan for Rural Development (Completed 2019), but with a more forward-looking approach to the policies, programmes and structures needed to embed economic and social development in rural areas and underscore the interdependence of urban and rural areas in national economic, social and cultural recovery.<b><\/b>DRCD is leading on ensuring strong coherence across key Government policies to ensure that rural communities and economies are in a strong position to:<\/p><p>- adapt to future challenges e.g. changing demographics within rural communities, climate change adaptation, Brexit, post-COVID recovery, and to <\/p><p>- take advantage of available\u00a0opportunities (e.g. diversification of rural economies, new ways of working, increased Government investment targeted at balanced regional\u00a0development). <\/p><p>In the present COVID environment the supports provided by my Department to assist vulnerable communities is more important than ever.
