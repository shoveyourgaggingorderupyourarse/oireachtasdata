Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  The minutes of the meeting of 20 September have been circulated.   Are they agreed?  Agreed.  There is a small change to be made to the minutes of the meeting of Tuesday, 25 September, which we will clear next week.  There are no matters arising from the minutes.<\/p> <p>  I move to correspondence.  There are no external witnesses before the committee today.  We are using this as an opportunity to consider correspondence received since the meeting in July, which numbers well in excess of 100 items some of which are routine.  People who have an interest in certain matters should watch proceedings as some of the items that we will publish today contain very interesting information.  We will not get to discuss them all in detail, inevitably some will have to be held over, but we will attempt to clear as many as we can.  This meeting should conclude at the latest by the time the series of votes comes before the D&aacute;il and so we would not return in the afternoon.  I propose that anything that is not dealt with is held over.  <\/p> <p>  The first item is No. 1479 B from Dr. Graham Love, Chief Executive, Higher Education Authority, dated 11 July 2018 providing the following information requested by the committee.  It is a comparative note on the financial position in terms of annual deficits-surpluses of all institutes of technology; and an update on the financial position of the accounts of Waterford Institute of Technology which has a substantial deficit of &euro;4.4 million.  Dr. Graham Love has indicated that he will leave his post soon.  At last week's meeting we asked him to come before the committee before he leaves the post at the end of October.  That request is in the system and we are waiting for a date.  We are keen for that meeting to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Will the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us what the rules are around institutes of technology and deficits?

I do not expect Dr. Love to say it in those terms, that would be unfair on him, but it would be responsible for us to follow that logic.<\/p> <p>  We have called the HEA in several times and have put it under pressure in relation to the need for reform in several areas and the kinds of governance structures that are in place.  What is the relationship between the institutes, the HEA and the Department?  Dr. Love is telling us that he is trying to drive reforms.  If it is the case that the HEA is being met with resistance from the Department, then surely that is a problem that should be examined. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#B01600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>If one has a deficit, one must fund it from somewhere.

I wish to make a number of observations on the detailed contents of this letter.  I draw members' attention to appendix 3 which outlines unpaid amounts, an issue that has been raised at this committee on previous occasions.  There was always a presumption that defaulters on a published tax defaulters list had paid the taxes owing, as detailed in the list.  However, we now know that the list only details the taxes due and does not necessarily mean that the tax was ever paid.  Appendix 3 provides a breakdown of the data relating to cases in 2017.  Of the total amount of cases published in 2017, the total debt as published at that time was &euro;53.13 million and the amount that remained unpaid was &euro;25.96 million.  Essentially, only 50% of what was published had actually been paid.  The most recent information relating to the unpaid &euro;25.96 million at the end of June 2018 is that &euro;11.64 million is not collectable, &euro;8.4 million of which relates to cases of an inability to pay due to liquidation.  There is still a balance that the Revenue Commissioners believe is collectable of &euro;14.1 million and this is being actively pursued.  We would like an assurance that a special effort is made by the Revenue Commissioners to collect the moneys owed by those on published tax defaulters lists.  Mr. Cody has said that of the total debt of &euro;53.13 million, an outstanding amount of &euro;14.1 million is collectable and is being pursued.  We would like to see a greater effort being made in this area.<\/p><p>The other part of the letter to which I draw the attention of members is that relating to the issue of the Tax Appeals Commission.  We asked for a detailed breakdown on the level of tax in dispute and the amounts settled by the Tax Appeals Commission.  Mr. Cody summarises the position by stating, &quot;The wide range of practical and operational complexities is such that it is not possible to forecast the proportion of the debt under appeal that is likely to be collected&quot;. <i><\/i>There is definitely a lacuna in the information available from the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax Appeals Commission.  Nobody seems to be able to provide a clear cut figure on what is collectable as a result of the Tax Appeals Commission process.  That is something that we will have to include in a periodic report.  We do not have a full breakdown of the figures yet.  I just wanted to make those two points about this correspondence from Mr. Cody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#D01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>When we met the representatives of the Tax Appeals Commission, what they told us about the circumstances under which they were working was jaw-dropping.

In some 50% of the audits there appears to be some comment about the lack of adherence to procurement rules.  It is rampant in the health sector, the HSE, the Department, and in education.  We need to look at the consequences of it.  Sometimes there are extreme manifestations of it such as in this case, which is subject to a criminal investigation.  There are other consequences in that there are risks to the organisations themselves if they do not follow the rules because there are always opportunities for those who feel they have been hard done by in the procurement process to take a case.

I welcome the Thorn report.  I have read it.  I would like the direction put into context.  A direction was issued by the Minister.  Can someone put that into context? Is that the first direction or is it the first of many to different organisations?<\/p> <p>  The report refers to effective governance and accountability as crucial.  I believe it is premature to go down the procurement route.  I agree with my colleague that the issue of procurement comes up repeatedly but there is a bigger picture here.  Effective governance and accountability is crucial.  The report outlines, in relation to Government procedures, that adequate arrangements to manage procurement and conflicts of interest were in place according to the documented procedures, however it highlights the shortcomings on an operative basis.  And so we are back again, and it was the same last Tuesday with the Department of the Taoiseach with regard to the President's Establishment, notwithstanding any attempts to deflect from the issue.  On paper we were learning in the reports that everything was fine but in practice it was not.  Here we have the same thing; on the ground everything is in place but on an operative basis it is not happening.  The Department has issued a very strong directive, has issued recommendations and has set timescales.  They had two weeks to respond to this but have they responded? I do not know.  When the Department issued this letter and direction they had two weeks to reply to it.  As there are many recommendations with timescales, we need to ensure those timescales are being complied with.  The committee should not be doing this, the Department of Education and Skills should be ensuring these timescales are complied with.<\/p> <p>  There is so much in this that one would despair.  Now they need an external agency again on this.  It is only thanks to those people who took a great interest, and to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office which deserves the main praise, and to the other people who paid attention to this, that we waded through all of this as best we could.

That then militates against small suppliers, however, so what one is looking for is a kind of happy medium.  With greater aggregation there are also longer chains of supply and one is more dependent on one supplier and can kind of get locked into a big supplier, so it is a very complicated process.

This was a report on a variety of issues but one of the substantial ones was the opening and reopening of Garda stations, which we gave a very good hearing here.  It was quite obvious to this committee that decisions were being made to reopen certain Garda stations that did not chime with the priorities of senior garda&iacute; on the ground, and we made a number of recommendations in this regard.  I am not at all satisfied with the responses we have got back on this.  They are parliamentary question-type responses that go through the motions but do not say anything, really.  It seems they will continue with the course of action on which they have embarked.  Some people have called this stroke politics.  That is how I see it, to be honest.  It is not good practice; it is bad practice, in my view.  That is the first issue.<\/p> <p>  There is also an issue I was following up concerning the IDA and the methodology used to verify the number of jobs created.  It does not accept the recommendation from this committee and is still holding to the view that it should be self-assessment.  I do not think that is right because we deserve to have the accurate figures.  Everybody benefits from having accurate figures, not figures that are based on self-assessment and a questionnaire that goes out to a client company asking how many jobs were created, with no verification process and a request to take at face value what is being said.  I do not think that is any way to make an evaluation because policy decisions arise from these figures as well.  They are also used, as we know, for propaganda purposes, which is fine as well.  Notwithstanding that, I am not happy with that response either.  The Chairman is saying to hold off on the matter.  My question is, given that we are doing periodic reports and getting responses - and it is good that we have got a response as at least they are reading our stuff and have to respond to it - should we have another leg to our work?

There is a note on the money accrued as a consequence of appeal cases taken for 2016 and 2017; a note on the legislative changes that have taken place and further improvements; and a note on the number of cases in hand and the age analysis.  For the information of the public, there is very interesting information in this document and I will ask for it to be put up on screen in order that people will see to what I am referring.  <\/p> <p>  Question No. 1 relates to a note on the money accrued as a consequence of appeals received in 2016.  It is alarming.  We are told that there are three cases under active appeal and that the amount of tax involved is &euro;361 million in respect of these three cases.  That means that there is an average sum of &euro;120 million involved in each of the three cases.  We ask that these matters be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  They are cases that were lodged in 2016 and 2017.  They were not lodged this year.  <\/p> <p>  The next line deals with cases over &euro;100 million.  We asked that question and I am surprised to note that there are three still in the system, with an amount potentially due to the taxpayer of &euro;361 million.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to cases involving amounts greater than &euro;10 million, there are 14 cases, with a total value of &euro;350 million, which gives an average figure of &euro;25 million for each case.  With regard to cases involving amounts greater than &euro;1 million, there are 61 cases involving a total sum of &euro;166 million.  <\/p> <p>  In total, there are 78 cases with the Tax Appeals Commissioner, with a potential value of &euro;878 million in outstanding tax.  Whatever the issues are, we will write back on foot of them to ask what special measures are being taken to bring the 78 cases to a conclusion.  It is fine to talk about the 342 cases in which the amounts involved are less than &euro;1,000 each.  I hope it does not have a system under which it deals with matters in date order and that instead there is in place a system of streaming and prioritising, especially when there are three cases involving a sum of &euro;120 million each.  Some of the cases involve a dispute about a tax clearance certificate and there might be no money involved.  We want a detailed report on the top 78 cases.  We do not want to identify the people involved, but to know what special measures in the interests of the taxpayer are being taken to resolve them as promptly as possible.  Are we agreed on that point?  I think people will be surprised by the extent of the moneys involved in that handful of cases.

The letter from the TUI is a cry for help and assistance from the many people who came forward in the institute at the request of the person carrying out the report who wrote to all staff members asking them to come forward if they had any information and meet him in confidence and they did.  I received a lot of protected disclosures and never put them into the public domain.  We went through the structures appropriately and brought in the Accounting Officer.  We put questions to the HEA which put a process in place.  We were to produce a report which was to be published last September.  One year on there is no sign of it.  There are very wealthy and influential people who have a right to defend themselves if they believe they need to legally challenge the report.<\/p><p>I have no difficulty with that but it should not hold up the report forever and there is no sense at this point that we will ever get a report.

People have come forward to tell me that they are now going for interviews for promotion and they are concerned about whether they will get the promotions.  There is a lot at stake here in terms of the reputation of the institute and the protection of individuals who came forward and because the HEA did not carry out due diligence in compiling the report, we are constantly told that it is being pushed back to the extent that we may never see it.  That is not acceptable and I do not know how we will remedy the situation but it must be remedied because we have to get a report, we have to get answers to the questions we put and we have to do justice to the people who came forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#G03900","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Can we ask that of Dr. Graham Love and the Department when they are here?

They are taking issue with correspondence between parties in a case and that is a matter for them.  We have to play with the deck that comes our way and some of those cards did come to us.  The only interest I had - and the committee was in general agreement - was in whether there was a role for us there to prevent a court case being taken and for us to ultimately get what we wanted in our report back in January, which was the establishment of a committee of inspection to provide relevant oversight.  I take Mr. McCarthy's point that it might not be correct for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be on that committee of inspection for different reasons but there certainly seems to be an absence of oversight.  As I said previously, this may already be in the process of being handled in the manner that provides the best value for money going but it is the most expensive liquidation in the history of the State and probably close to being the biggest in Europe, if not the biggest.  Because of the money involved, any perception of it being on autopilot due to the lack of a committee of inspection is an issue.  The applicant in the case before the courts appears to have the same motive as us, except that it is costing us all money there.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence that was shown to me - and I put this on record at a previous meeting because I Deputy Cullinane had been asking if I had been shown correspondence that I did not share with the committee - showed that the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO, had made an approach to the solicitors for the applicant asking if they would withdraw their case if the CSSO were to defer to the Committee on Public Accounts, which is something that I would agree with if it was possible for it to happen.  I have a problem with us being used as a pawn in somebody else's game.  If they want us to be involved, then they should involve us but it is not within the gift of the CSSO, any more than it is within the gift of the Department or of the Taoiseach to offer the work of this committee as an olive branch to anybody else, notwithstanding the fact that I would agree with that happening.  I do not know where it is going.  We have put it on record that we would like to engage and we have noted the importance of appropriate oversight in our report on what is heading for &euro;300 million in costs so far.  It could rise as far as &euro;1 billion by the time it is finished.  Nobody knows, but we have KPMG here, which I am sure is doing a fantastic job and paying itself from recoveries.  Those amounts, while agreed in terms of the lower rates negotiated by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, would be questioned by a committee of inspection as to whether two partners, four juniors and a technician are needed for a specific course of action for example.  That level of oversight would be there with such a committee.  We do not have that now and while the Act theoretically vests a lot more power in the Minister than a committee of inspection would, Ministers are busy people and they depend on officials.  Despite the excellent work of Mr. Carville and his team, it is a relatively small team and following our exchange with him on the matter, we established that there was not a lot of legal expertise on the team, even though that was something that had just been rectified or was about to be rectified at the time.<\/p><p>There is a lot of concern about the moneys involved and the lack of public oversight.  I put in the rider that perhaps everything is in order and better than it could be with 40 committees of inspection.  However, it may not be.  That is why we should continue as a committee to promote the establishment of a committee of inspection in line with our report in January.  Perhaps we can write back to the Department to say we stand ready to assist it if there is a way to avoid wasting taxpayers' money through the Department defending this.  To the best of my knowledge, however, the Department has not issued a defence, which itself is the subject of a court hearing in early October.  That is more money being cost to the State whereas we all want the same thing here.  Can no one sit around the table and crack heads?  In any legal proceedings in which I have had the misfortune to be involved, legal teams tended to communicate through the back channels.  Perhaps we could save the State some money and get the level of oversight the committee, on behalf of the people, yearns for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#H01300","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>At the meeting the last day, we asked the official from the Department of Finance, Mr. Carville, whether there was a reference to the Committee of Public Accounts in connection with this case from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor without any consultation with us in respect of our views on that matter.

It is very unsatisfactory that this is still going on.  I echo the points made about the person taking the case.  He is trying to achieve exactly the same thing we would want to achieve by having the kind of oversight which has been suggested.  It is unusual for the Department of Finance to be the supervisor in a liquidation.  Notwithstanding the size of the liquidation, if I recall correctly one or two people in the Department were supervising it.  This was Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society and we all know the cost that has had to be carried following the collapse and the assumption of the debt by the State.  The idea that there is no full scrutiny or full visibility on the scrutiny is completely unacceptable.  I am concerned that this is not only adding to the costs, but that there is delay.  All year, assets are being disposed of and, as this goes on, the problem is reinforced.  There was a very poor relationship between the Department of Finance and IBRC before the liquidation.  The rules around how assets are sold changed post liquidation but I want to see, as a member of the committee and as a citizen, exactly how that is working.  It is completely unsatisfactory.  When Deputy MacSharry raised this first, it was simply a question of asking whether we could have a conversation and to see if it would be possible in terms of the court case.

Certainly, my understanding was that the issues raised in the plenary summons were practical questions on the overall supervision and monitoring.  We asked at that point if those questions would be answered clearly because the Department had a duty to answer them.  We asked why we had to go through a plenary summons and a statement of claim.  At that point, the official said he did not disagree with that interpretation.  I emphasise that this is my understanding of it.

To the best of my knowledge and the last time I checked, no defence had been lodged but there is a hearing on that.

It is an extensive letter from which I wish to highlight a couple of points.  Deputy Connolly has an interest in some of this also.  Regarding to the 2002 indemnity agreement, which takes us back 16 years at this stage, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; refers to table C and says &euro;4.21 million remains to be realised from that 16 year-old agreement.  He refers to appendix 2 in relation to the 2002 agreement and the position in relation to Mounthawk in Tralee and says it is not possible to provide a timeframe for completion in that regard as it depends on the resolution of litigation.  The property is being used as a primary school currently and, as such, we have the benefit of it, if not yet the legal title.  The same applies to Waterpark, Newtown Road, Waterford, where the estimated timeframe for completion is the end of the third quarter of 2018, which is this weekend.<\/p><p>He also says that he will have the matters concerning Coisc&eacute;im, Cappoquin and the Sacred Heart Centre in Waterford cleared by this weekend.  The estimated timeframe for completion of this is the end of this week.  This is the letter we received from him in July.  I propose we give him ten days and write to confirm the day.  The timescales he gave us of his own volition in July have been upheld.  Concerning the second agreement, that is, the 2009 voluntary offer, there are still outstanding moneys.  A cash contribution of &euro;8.8 million remains outstanding from the Christian Brothers.  The contribution is expected to be completed before the end of this year.<\/p><p> Appendix 3 concerns properties to be transferred as part of the 2009 voluntary transfer agreement.  Some items are still outstanding.  I refer to St. Bernard's Group Homes, Fethard, Tipperary.  The estimated time for completion of that transfer is this weekend.  The transfer of the adult education centre on Ozanam Street in Waterford is to be completed by the end of this year.  The transfer of lands at Convent Road, Cahir, County Tipperary is to be completed by this weekend.  Lands at Ballyjamesduff in Cavan are to be transferred by the end of this year.  Also to be completed at the end of this year or possibly next year is transfer of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<\/p><p> The following items have an estimated time for completion of the end of the year; the Blaith&iacute;n childcare facility at Gracepark Road, Drumcondra; St. Patrick's primary school, Altamont Street, Westport, County Mayo; and St. Anne's Industrial School for Girls and Junior Boys, Lenaboy, Galway.  In ten days we will want a report on the commitments that have been made to completing those by the end of September, outlining whether these commitments were met.  We will want a report in January on whether commitments have been met to complete projects by the end of this year, bearing in mind that the most recent are nine years old and the older projects ones are 16 years old.  We should not be here talking about matters that should have been resolved 15 years ago.  However, we will not let them go.  Unfortunately it is the nature of this committee.  We will write to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; on that basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#J01900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I recall that I raised this issue in connection with the redress board and the very detailed report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We realised then that there were outstanding moneys and there were two different agreements.  The 2002 agreement is legally enforceable.  Some 3%, &euro;4.21 million, of what was agreed under that has yet to be realised.<\/p> <p>  The Ryan report was then published, with all its stories of pain and horror.  I will not go into it.  In a different life I was there and had the privilege of seeing it first-hand.  As a result of that, the 18 congregations were again asked to contribute.  Some 15 of them did.  They came forward with a new agreement in 2009.  I want to thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; for doing his best with all of these letters.  It has certainly improved the detail.  It has taken some time and I thank him.  I hope that level of clarity will continue because it will help us get our heads around it.  Even with this level of clarity it is difficult, because the Christian Brothers are thrown in there with &euro;127 million.  I am sure Dublin TDs will have a particular interest in that.  <\/p> <p>  Where am I going with this?  We were unaware of this except for the general assurances that these two agreements were in place, one legally enforceable and the other not.  In Galway there is a particular property which is symbolic.  It is an industrial school in Taylor's Hill that by the Department's admission has been empty since 2011.  My knowledge tells me it has been empty for even longer.  It was functioning as a childcare centre.  It has been empty since.  Why I am zoning in on this?  Galway 2020 made the very positive announcement that the nuns had contributed this building as a gift to the city.  That upset me and a lot of other people.  There is no place for emotion on this committee, but that was wrong.  It was not a gift.  It was part of a package from 2009.  As such, the narrative continued to be a false one right up to 2017 and 2018.  That is the difficulty about openness and accountability.  If the city council had announced that this was not a gift but part of a redress package, particularly the 2009 one, it would have been very helpful to the narrative and to healing.  Had they put the survivors at the top of the list, that would have been very helpful.<\/p> <p>  I notice that there has been a change in language today.  I note the property I have mentioned has still not been transferred.  The report states that if the city council assumes ownership of the property it plans to renovate \"this will include consultation and engagement with interested stakeholders, especially persons who were associated with the property in its many previous guises\".  That is the first time this has been recognised. <\/p> <p>  I will come to a general point in a minute if members will bear with me.  This is one example where a building has remained unnecessarily empty since 2009.  Whatever value it had then has depreciated because it is has become dilapidated.  While there is a positive story, in that the city is going to gain, no explanation has ever been given for the building being empty from 2009, despite the fact that the city council tabled a motion at the time asking for it to be transferred.  That is just one example of how these agreements are implemented, or not implemented, without monitoring.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the second agreement in 2009, as part of which 15 congregations came forward.  Somebody may correct me here, because I am not an expert in figures.  Some 53% of that has yet to be realised.  That is outlined on page 1 of the report.  This is subject to a few small considerations.  That is totally unacceptable.  This is 2018.  Notwithstanding that it is not legally enforceable, the congregations came forward willingly on the basis of what was set out in the Ryan report, the results of that report and the amount paid by the State for the redress board.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might remind me.  I think it was &euro;1 billion but that may be clarified.  The congregations came forward with a contribution of which 53% still has be implemented in 2018.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#K00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>The figure of 53% refers to both agreements.

I do not need to go into the rest of it.  I have serious concerns about the robust governance structures but, importantly, many people on the ground have serious concerns also.  I welcome that the Department is saying this, but what robust governance structures are already in place for the money paid out?  There is &euro;15 million committed.

That is why the cost went from in the region of &euro;6 million to approximately &euro;8 million over a period from 2006 to 2018.  Regarding this one, I checked this today.  Let us stick to the facts.  The latest person to resign was the chief executive officer.<\/p><p>Yesterday I received an invitation to an event which was signed by the personal assistant to the CEO.  The website for the Galway European Capital of Culture still lists Ms Kiely as CEO.  One might say these are minor details but they are a reflection of the situation.

There are many other issues which may not be within the remit of the committee, such as the lack of an Irish language officer and so on, but in the context of value for money, what robust structures are in place to safeguard the spending of the &euro;15 million being allocated by a Department?

On the \"This Week\" programme on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 last Sunday, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, again defended the scheme in spite of the fact that only six communities across the country have taken up the CCTV scheme.  He put the onus back on local communities and did not address the fundamental questions raised by the committee in respect of data and how they are managed.  Judging by the interviews carried out with members of local communities, the communities are crying out for assistance.  They have been left with an onerous task.  The questions raised by the committee have not been answered but the scheme is still being defended publicly, as was the case last weekend.  I wish to support the cause of those communities.  The current situation is unacceptable.  No one should stand over a scheme which has only been taken up by six communities across the country.  The scheme is not working and that is not defendable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#M04300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>We will return to the topic next Thursday.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1506 from Mr. Martin Whelan of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, dated 3 August and providing up-to-date information requested by the committee at a previous meeting.  A number of matters arising from the meeting are covered.  In regard to the funding of debt management, a chart is provided which outlines cash balances since 2004.  That information will be of interest to some.  The correspondence provides information on the Irish Strategic Investment Fund relating to a schedule of projects excluded for environmental and tobacco reasons.  The next item details the amount of funding for residential housing.  However, the information given in that respect is inaccurate and is corrected by the subsequent item of correspondence.  Details are provided on the State Claims Agency and the list of public bodies under its remit.  There is information on the role of NewERA and details relating to the corporate governance of the NTMA.  We will note and publish that.  The information will be of great interest to some people.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence concerns a similar topic.  It is No. 1507 B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing an information note requested by the committee on to the possible inclusion of local authorities and other public bodies on the general indemnity scheme.  Mr. Watt points out that it would require a decision of the relevant Minister to include local authorities in the indemnity scheme.  There is a later item of correspondence on this issue which we can also discuss later.  There is a big issue in respect of this letter.  When the State Claims Agency was here, we asked what public bodies were included under its aegis.  It gave us a list and I asked for the main areas that were excluded.  Going back to the previous correspondence, the sectors that do not come under the State Claims Agency are the university sector, the voluntary secondary schools sector, the primary schools sector, local authorities, Teagasc and semi-State bodies.  I raised it because the section 38 bodies recently come in under the State Claims Agency's brief and I asked if that could not be extended to others.  That is what prompted this.  We also wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the issue.  In correspondence No. 1507 B, the Secretary General said they are insured by Irish Public Bodies, IPB.  I want to know why we have two bodies insuring State organisations with the State Claims Agency handling their cases when they have an insurance policy.  We asked about the value for money.  Mr. Watt writes:<\/p><blockquote>However, the value for money provided by Irish Public Bodies has been examined.  In April 2015, a Value for Money Steering Group was established with representatives of the County and City Managers Association, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  The objective of the Steering Group was to oversee a value for money review by IPB and it concluded that &quot;at an aggregate level, IPB is providing an insurance service that represents value for money for its members and is operated efficiently&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>We want a copy of that report immediately, nothing more and nothing less, with no prevarication.<br\/><br\/>We had separate correspondence from Ms Dowling, the former chairperson of the insurance body that looks at those figures.  Having seen the conversations, she wished us luck.  As chair of the board that dealt with some of those insurance issues, she could never get it.  The section 38 bodies - all the hospitals - can move in under the State Claims Agency and have it handle the cases.  Maybe Irish Public Bodies gives a great service but nobody can say that except by looking at that report, which we want to see.  We will write back to the Secretary General saying that he is to get the report because he is the one who told us about it.  It comes in under the Office of Government Procurement, the City and County Managers Association and the ETBs.  I do not care who gives it to us but Mr. Robert Watt is to secure that report for the committee.  It will tell us whether there is value for money and will deal with the whole issue of claims to local authorities.  The State Claims Agency handles the central ones.  We need to see that.  It is not just about local authorities.  We note No. 1522 C, which also relates to these issues.<br\/><br\/>The next item - some of it is a bit slow to go through - is another minute from the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to the committee's periodic report.  There are three such items, which we will over, so people can have time to study them in the meantime.  We will hold that over until next week.<br\/><br\/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1512 B from An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, dated 2 August 2018, responding to the committee&rsquo;s concerns about data protection issues impacting on inquiries and commissions of investigation.  The Taoiseach advises he has referred the matter to the Attorney General.  Can we agree to note and publish this?  Agreed.  The Cook report or somebody else raised that issue with us and we passed it on to the Taoiseach to be considered in respect of the terms of reference and if there were going to be data protection issues.<br\/><br\/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1513 B<b><\/b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, providing further details requested by the committee on the status of the non-screening cervical cancer misdiagnosis claims.  We will be coming to that matter separately.  We might go into private session at the end of this part of the meeting to discuss the best way for us and the Joint Committee on Health to handle it.  We will note and publish that.<br\/><br\/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1514 B<b><\/b>from the NTMA, concerning the &euro;526 million provided for residential housing.  I want to deal with this.  We got a previous letter from the NTMA which I referred to a moment ago.  Clearly, the figures in that were wrong.  This is essentially a correction of No. 1506.  When it was before the committee, in respect of the &euro;526 million for residential housing, we asked the NTMA for a note on the number of houses delivered by the end of 2017 and the projected numbers for each year from 2021 from this investment.  This was as part of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is under the NTMA.  At the meeting, we were told that it had allocated &euro;526 million.  We asked how many houses it had built by the end of 2017 and the reply, No. 1506, said that from the &euro;526 million referred to in the annual report for residential housing, 1,747 units had been completed to date.  Then this letter comes back to say that the number of units completed at the end of 2017 was 894.  That is a different figure from what was given before.  Maybe it is just correcting that.  The money did not produce the number of houses we thought it had.  We note and publish that item.<br\/><br\/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1515 B<b><\/b>from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing a note as requested on the timely submission of financial statements of education organisations that receive over &euro;1 million in funding from the Department.  We note and publish that as part of our ongoing work to make sure organisations provide their accounts in a timely manner.  These are organisations that receive funding from the Department but are not directly under its remit.<br\/><br\/>Next items of correspondence are Nos. 1526 B, 1528 B and 1530 B<b><\/b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, dated 17 and 20 August 2018.

I do not know if other people have read this.  It is going on for a number of years now.  This letter is as if they were not here at all.  That is my view on it.<\/p><p>The issues we have are as follows.  We have disclosures, and the people mentioned in the disclosures were responsible for providing legal briefs to companies to come up with terms of reference for what, ultimately, was a desktop audit.  The people who did it only talked to senior management, many of whom were allegedly mentioned in the disclosures.  Several meetings ago, I said that we needed to start at the beginning with this KPMG report and to work through it.  There may be an issue in how disclosures are dealt with nationally from a procedural point of view and as a matter of public policy.  Without prejudice to anyone involved, one cannot have people named in a disclosure having any hand, act or part in setting terms of reference or providing a legal brief.  Many of the answers we had on that day were to the effect that they got solicitors to come but they drafted the terms of reference.  Solicitors will do nothing for somebody without being given a brief, though they might give an idea of what is best practice.<\/p><p> I am told that there were people on the audit committee.  Forgive my language - I am mixing up internal audit and the audit committee.  The people on the audit committee were potentially mentioned in the disclosure.  The same individuals secured the services of another legal firm and set the terms of reference for them.  The same people who advised them on how to handle the fallout from the KPMG report had a hand in determining the brief for KPMG in carrying out the desktop audit.  It was not thorough enough and the same people were involved.  We cannot have a perception of a conflict of interest, however misplaced it might be.  There may be an national issue but I am certainly not happy about this individual case.  There are missing pages and other stuff.  The people mentioned in the disclosures are investigating themselves so CIT is, in effect, investigating itself.  That is not right and we cannot sit here comfortably and say the matter has been dealt with.<\/p><p> I know that a previous Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was not a member, looked at the KPMG report but we need to start at the beginning again as it is unsatisfactory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#N00600","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>CIT is the gift that keeps on giving.

In fairness to the HEA, it gives us a response in its letter, No. 1561, a paragraph of which I will now read into the record as there has been quite a bit of discussion about it.  We had written to it about the weakness in control.  The letter states:<\/p><blockquote>[Our] correspondence was considered by HEA Board&rsquo;s Finance and Governance Committee at its meeting on 24 July 2018.  At the meeting the Committee agreed that that the HEA should reply to CIT noting the process changes the Institute has implemented and recommending a change to the sign-off process.  Specifically, the Committee recommended that in relation to the change made to CIT&rsquo;s hospitality procedure that requires prior approval from the Vice-President for Finance and Administration for President or Governing Body-related expenditure over &euro;500, the Committee was of the view [that is, the HEA board's finance and governance committee] that it would be more appropriate for such expenditure to be signed off by the Chairman of the Governing Body&rsquo;s Finance Sub-Committee.  A letter to that effect issued to CIT on 29 August 2018.<br \/><br \/>In relation to the amount of expenditure incurred for these events that the HEA considers was not subject to appropriate controls (ca. &euro;6,700), the HEA is currently considering the most appropriate means of recouping this money from CIT.<\/blockquote><p>In fairness, I could have read that before the conversation started, but there is a system in place and at least somebody is doing something.  I do not know how &euro;6,700 will affect the CIT.  There is a strong point being made here as a result of the ongoing discussions related to that particular function.  For the first time at national level, the HEA will specifically recoup money that in its view was not subject to appropriate control.  It is a small victory but there is a matter of principle established here, which must be widely circulated.  Where the HEA or other bodies come to the conclusion that the expenditure was not subject to appropriate control it will have to be recouped from the body.  There is a point that is being well made, and it has been helpful.  Once the message gets out that that money will have to be recouped where HEA is satisfied that it was not appropriate, there is a good lesson learned here.  This item of correspondence is helping with the conversation we are having, and we will note and publish it.

It might be worth at some point considering talking to someone about institutional culture and how to change behaviour in order that we can have a range of things that might be available to us to suggest in the future.  In other public account committees in other countries, what are the things that produced that kind of outcome?  We should have a range of things we can suggest.

They blame the culture, the system, the policy and so on.  It is about individuals as well.  It is not about an ice sculpture or a portrait, which is the visible stuff, the window dressing that we get to see, and which makes me worried about what is under the bonnet, particularly when one looks at investigations done by KPMG and so on where there has been at least the complexion of people investigating themselves.  There might be no wrongdoing at all, but then again there might be.  It is all wrong.  It is great that the chairman of the governing body will sign off from now on, but as things stood I have no doubt the chairman of the governing body would have signed off for the ice sculpture, the party and everything else.  In fairness to Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, when he was here and we raised this matter, he said it was a matter of fact that the contribution of someone who has served his or her country and institution so well would be acknowledged, and I agree with that.<\/p> <p>  In everybody else's office, however, it is \"pass the hat around\", everyone puts in a score, and there is a bit of finger food, a pint and a voucher for Brown Thomas if one is lucky.  That is the end of it.  As for the portrait thing, CIT has an art college.  I am sure it is proud of its students, and I am sure the best student could be provided with a bursary of &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400 or - let us really push the boat out - &euro;500, as opposed to spending &euro;22,000.  I am sure it has confidence in its own students.  That is the minutiae, the window dressing, the surface stuff, but the fact that it existed and happened worries me about what is beneath the bonnet.  It is common sense; we should not throw lavish bashes.  It is not Mr. Robert Mugabe's going away party that we run here.  There is a way to do business and that is not it.  In fairness, in most private-sector companies that I worked in, and certainly in the House, when an usher or someone else retires, an email goes out and if people want to give a few shillings they do, and there is a modest evening and maybe a gift given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#P00900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>There is a good principle established here.  We have been through this in a different guise, and it is something the Committee of Public Accounts should return to at a later date.  The submission of accounts by various organisations, such as the education and training boards, ETBs and so on, was delayed in the past.  However, section 38 and 39 organisations also had a poor record of submitting audited accounts to the HSE, and the HSE's former chief executive, Mr. Tony O'Brien, thanked the Committee on Public Accounts for putting the boot in on those delays.  It allowed him go to every one of them and say that unless they got their accounts into the HSE in a timely manner their funding would be held up for the current year.  Lo and behold, there was 100% compliance.  There was a consequence for the boards.  I propose that any time we suggest a sanction on an organisation for a corporate or cultural issue, or something that is under the board's remit, it should be directed at the board members and should not be taken out of the service that is provided.  When a board is employed to do a job, where the members all get their couple of grand each year, if they do not do their job there should be consequences at board level.  If the board sends down the right message through the chief executive, what will happen down the line is remarkable.

One is the fact that Enet was awarded the contract in 2004 and the contract was then extended until 2030 without going back to the market with a tender.  Much of what has gone on in relation to the issue is opaque and requires scrutiny.  In mid-2017 the infrastructural investment fund invested &euro;200 million in Enet.  To be honest, I find that curious given that it is buying into a company whose only product is owned by the State, so the investment was in the State's own asset, as it were.<\/p> <p>  There are probably two issues.  The first is that when the investment was made, Enet was vying for the broadband contract.  It is not clear which came first.  That is something we need to know because it would have had a bearing on the investment.  Broadband has been a huge source of frustration for a long time, given that much has been promised and the roll-out has been hugely disappointing outside of major urban centres.  A lot of money has been invested.  The situation is opaque and there is a need for scrutiny into what happened.  We are now at the point where, currently, there is only one tender.  We talk about the need for competitive tendering.  The personnel within the company who made the tender has changed over time.  I do not know if we can look at the issue but it is happening in real time.  The problem is that Actavo, formerly Sitserv, was involved, and there is a commission of investigation into it.  The whole issue is hugely problematic.  At the very least in this term we should get the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come before the committee to get a better understanding of what has happened to date in terms of the investment that was made in relation to this contract and about having better oversight of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#R01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>And the lessons learnt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#R01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Yes, because it is the kind of thing one could predict in the future would require an additional spend.

The Government programme divides the country up into various areas, including what is known as an amber area that will be subject to the new contract where there is only one bidder.  My experience is that private companies who provide broadband commercially outside of the scheme are eating into the amber areas on the edge of towns.  I fear the Department is trundling along thinking the amber areas will have X number of people and are constructing the contract on that basis.  By the time the work is ready to start a lot of cherry-picking will have happened in the amber areas and there will be fewer houses available for incorporation into the plan.  Broadband is a dynamic issue and is not fixed while tenders and revised tenders take place.  The other operators are eating into the good bits of the amber areas as we speak and by the time a contract is signed the total population of the amber areas requiring broadband will have changed from today's configuration.  Even though we are talking about future expenditure I hope the lesson has been learnt from the previous process.  We will put broadband issues into the work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#R01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.

I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on this issue previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#S03700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538035200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I did a report a number of years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#S03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>There is a previous report.  At this stage, if the individual wants to take up a policy issue on the matter, we refer him to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for whatever action it deems appropriate.<\/p> <p>  No. 1533 is a matter from an individual dated 20 August 2018 on a query from the committee on foot of our correspondence regarding the timely presentation of accounts.

We have discussed this issue at length and it is noted.<\/p> <p>  No. 1539 is from an individual, dated 15 August, on presidential remuneration.  We note it but will not discuss it.<\/p> <p>  No. 1540 is from an individual, dated 23 August, who is inquiring about the costs associated with an inquiry into the Midlands Regional Hospital and the PRG investigation into Portlaoise.  I propose we write to the HSE for a detailed information note on the direct and indirect costs associated with this matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1541 is a letter from Mr. John Devitt, chief executive, Transparency International Ireland, dated 27 August 2018, providing information on its integrity at work programme; the Speak Up Report 2017 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this correspondence?  Agreed.  Mr. Devitt has offered to meet the committee and we will consider that suggestion as part of our work programme.<\/p><p>We will keep it on the list for consideration.<\/p><p> Nos. 1553, 1555, 1559 and 1564 are from an individual requesting confirmation that the Government did not incur expenses arising from the visit of the Pope to Ireland.  I propose we request the information from the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as appropriate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 1565 is from Deputy David Cullinane regarding a proposed invitation to Dr. Gabriel Scally regarding his report.  We will deal with that separately in the context of how we deal with the cervical cancer as part of our role compared to the role of the Joint Committee on Health.<\/p><p> No. 1580 is from me, proposing that the committee examine Vote 1.  There will be no further discussion.<\/p><p> No. 1581 is dated 18 September, from Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, looking for clarification on whether she is needed for next week's meeting on CervicalCheck, which was supposed to be this week's business, but we are rescheduling that.  We will hold her offer to attend open until we finalise that work programme and the date for that.  She was the clinical director of CervicalCheck but no longer works for the HSE.<\/p><p> Nos. 1516, 1517, 1573 and 1574 are from an individual with regard to a previous HSE human resources, HR, inquiry.  The correspondence is further to previous correspondence that was dealt with at our meeting in July.  It was agreed to ask the HSE to respond.  The HSE to wrote to us on the matter and advised that an agreement was concluded between the staff panel, unions and the HSE under the aegis of the national joint committee in May 2015.  The corporate employee relations service notified all divisions of the HSE and section 38 agencies of the provisions of the agreement and the necessity to advise those who were unsuccessful in their application for regularisation or who have otherwise not received any outcome of their application.  I propose to send the HSE response to the individual and if the individual wants to come back to us with further information, he or she is free to do so.  While all those wonderful provisions happened at national level, it appeared from what the individual wrote that staff members on the ground never got the information.  They were never aware of this programme.  While employee relations services, corporate committees and joint committees said it was all in order, staff members who may have been interested in being considered for that insist they were never notified.  We will send all that.  That is the official response.  What happened on the ground may have been different.  If he or she has evidence, we will look at that matter because it does not fully address the exact query with regard to individuals not being informed on a local level.<\/p><p> No. 1576 is from an individual, dated 30 August, who alleges unauthorised state aid is paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to Horse Sport Ireland.  I propose we request a response from the Department.  It does not like giving money to Horse Sport Ireland.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 1578 is from an individual, dated 14 September, requesting the committee to make recommendations to the Government regarding accountability for the management of the State's property assets.  This matter is related to a forthcoming report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and refers to an issue raised with the previous committee.  I propose we await the forthcoming report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and consider it as part of our work programme at that stage.<\/p><p> No. 1579 is from Susan Gilvarry, solicitor to the Cooke commission of investigation, dated 14 September 2018, requesting documents submitted to the committee from Fortress during the inquiry into Project Eagle.  The secretariat has sent the requested documentation to the committee and we will note the request.  The letter refers to Deputy Catherine Murphy but it should have been Deputy Catherine Connolly.<\/p><p> No. 1587 is from a solicitor, dated 27 August, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding increased cost of long-term care in West Kerry Community Hospital.  That is probably funded by the fair deal scheme.  The people who set the price for the fair deal scheme are the National Treatment Purchase Fund, or it might be a matter for the HSE.  We will write to both organisations for a response to that matter because I am sure the State is paying most of the costs of care in that organisation, through the fair deal scheme or otherwise, even though there is a private element involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#S03900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538035200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>It seems to be a private patient in a public nursing home, so that would be determined by the HSE rather than HIQA-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#T00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538035200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Sorry, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092700002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1538035200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>We will write directly to the HSE for a detailed response to the issue with regard to that West Kerry Community Hospital.

This is an employment issue.  It states that the individual contacted the committee in early 2009.  It appears to be a ten year old issue.  I will not mention the individual's name.  The end of the correspondence indicates that the individual was encouraged to seek legal advice, and had done so initially but this time it was with protection.  We will note it.

The correspondence has not been circulated because there are some libel and general data protection regulation, GDPR, concerns.  There is also considerable personal information.  At Deputy Fitzmaurice's request, I met him and the person who made the complaints before the summer recess and asked them to send us a detailed letter.  We will not circulate this.  I will go back to Deputy Fitzmaurice and ask for the points to be made in a fresh letter without the personal details next time.  It relates to the possibility of improper or illegal charging of residents for incontinence wear at the Brothers of Charity Services in Roscommon and the right of those residents to a refund.  The matter relates to the general governance of sections 38 and 39 organisations.  I propose we write to the HSE to establish whether it is satisfied that all residents who were improperly or illegally charged for incontinence wear at the Brothers of Charity Services in Roscommon have been refunded and to provide a note on the HSE's oversight of this matter and how and whether the matter has been fully dealt with.
