There is no such thing as a good Brexit.  It will be negative for the economy, trade, jobs, households, the labour market and so on.  The study's analysis of a no-deal, or disorderly, Brexit is particularly stark and significantly more negative than that of previous reports.  Some 80,000 jobs will be lost in the event of a disorderly Brexit and there will be a severe impact on trade, notwithstanding whatever positive diversion we receive from foreign direct investment.  The overall impact will be negative and damaging to Ireland, while a no-deal Brexit, in particular, will affect firms' capacity to trade, the labour market, the public finances, the household sector and the broader economy.<\/p><p>That underlines a reminder to politicians on all sides across Europe, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland that a no-deal scenario must be avoided if at all possible.  I am not sure if that is the view of everybody across Europe or some of our friends in the United Kingdom.  I got a sense at the European summit last week that some people were saying that they had had enough of this, that they should get rid of it and move on to the next business.  It is not the next business for the 80,000 people who would lose their jobs or the livelihoods and companies that will be damaged.  There has to be a reassertion of the imperative to avoid a no-deal Brexit.<\/p> <p> I believe President Macron asked the Taoiseach what will happen if there is a no-deal Brexit.  He asked the Taoiseach if Ireland would be fine, which is probably the overstatement of the week, to which the Taoiseach replied that we can cope.  This has not been denied.  I would like an explanation of how the 80,000 people who will lose their jobs will cope.  We should take every opportunity to point out to our European colleagues that it needs a medium-term extension.  There should be no equivocation about the necessity for one.<\/p> <p> I believe Chancellor Angela Merkel asked the Taoiseach about the Border question.  It has been revealed that the Commission is in talks with the Irish Government about a no-deal scenario and what would happen at the Border.  It says that if there is no deal, there is no backstop, and there will be checks at the Border and, in essence, there will be a Border.  The precise form and nature of the checks, how they will take place, and at what distance is being discussed.  I think the Taoiseach said it is preliminary and there is a rough plan.  Does the Taoiseach not think it is time for him to be upfront and transparent with the D&aacute;il and public about the impact of a no-deal scenario on the Border question?  What will happen at the Border?  What is the nature of the discussions under way between the Commission and the Government?  Will the Taoiseach outline details of the type of arrangements being discussed in the context of a no-deal scenario?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553609100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The ESRI report published this morning is a reminder of the very stark consequences that Brexit will have for Ireland and the Irish economy.  It confirms many things that we knew already.  Brexit will be bad for Ireland in any scenario.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland.  While there may be opportunities, there will certainly be more downsides than upsides.  It confirms again that a deal is better than no deal, and a managed no-deal situation would be better than a disorderly no-deal situation.  It also shows that the economy will continue to grow.  It will not be as fast as we anticipate it will grow in the event of a deal but it will continue to grow.  We will not go into recession, at least according to the ESRI.  There will continue to be an increase in the number of jobs.  There will be more jobs, just not as many extra jobs as we would have in the event of a deal.  Incomes will continue to rise, just not as fast as they would rise in the event of a deal.  Public finances would deteriorate, but not to the extent that we witnessed ten years ago.  We would move from a small surplus into a small deficit.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, we should not underestimate how serious a no-deal Brexit could be for some very vulnerable sectors in our economy, especially the agrifood sector, tourism and small exporters whose only market is the UK.  That is where we are most exposed and they will need the most support should we end up in a no-deal scenario in a few weeks.  I heard Deputy Martin say a moment ago that we should avoid no deal at all costs.  I am not entirely sure what he means by \"at all costs\" or what price Fianna F&aacute;il would be willing to pay to avoid no deal.

Ours has been the only party here that has been resolute in avoiding the need for a general election in order that the Government will have space to negotiate on Brexit.

The Taoiseach, Fine Gael and its partners in Fianna F&aacute;il support increasing carbon taxes and it is almost certain that that recommendation will feature in the committee's report.  Regardless, the Taoiseach has indicated that it is, in effect, Government policy.  At the weekend he said increasing carbon taxes was on the table for inclusion in the October budget and that increases would be in line with the committee's recommendation of &euro;80 per tonne, or four times the current level.<\/p><p>Climate change is a massive problem.  It is perhaps the defining challenge of our generation.  There is an all of society acceptance that IT must be tackled and that we are already way behind where we need to be in tackling the issue effectively.  The way to fight climate change is not to penalise ordinary families and working people by increasing their fuel costs or utility bills.  That is not something Sinn F&eacute;in will support.  We will not support any increase in carbon tax that will not protect low and middle income earners and ensure the big polluters will carry their responsibilities and pay their way.  We already have very high fuel and energy costs in this state and the current carbon tax has not lowered emissions levels.  Carbon emissions have, in fact, increased and loading another layer of cost and tax on ordinary people will not change behaviour, yet the Government seems intent on pursuing this course of action.  Unless it puts measures in place to give families alternatives, a carbon tax is just a punitive tax and must absolutely be opposed.  The Taoiseach should be aware that there are families who are at the pin of their collar.  They are just about getting by and should not have to pay the price because of the actions of big corporate polluters.  I hope the Taoiseach agrees with that sentiment.  We need to see climate change tackled in a progressive way that will combine social justice and fairness with the obvious environmental demands.  People need to be able to switch to alternatives.  That means that we need a comprehensive retrofitting programme.  People need to be able to switch to heat pumps easily, make the change to electric vehicles in a cost effective way and avail of microgeneration.  We also need real investment in public transport.<\/p> <p> The type of carbon tax the Government is proposing is not the solution.  It would be ineffective, regressive and only creates the illusion of action.  Can the Taoiseach accept that, as currently devised, the Government's carbon tax plan will impact disproportionately on low and middle income families who cannot afford to switch to electric cars and make their homes more fuel efficient?  Will he accept that this approach is wrong and commit to going back to the drawing board and scrapping the Government's regressive and out of touch proposals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600005#C01800","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553610300,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Deputy is getting the all-party committee mixed up with the Government and the Fine Gael Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610300,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach does that all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600006#D00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610300,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Never allow the facts to get in the way of a good political charge.  I have published no carbon tax plan.  The all-party committee is working on the issue and I hope it will be able to report this week.  I also hope we will all give its report a good reading and a fair hearing before coming out against it.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the Government took the decision not to increase carbon tax in the last budget and that we sustained some criticism for not doing so.  By the way, we did increase the fuel allowance, but we did not increase the carbon tax and took the decision not to do so for very good reasons.  First, VAT was going up in the new year and we did not want to increase two taxes; rather, we wanted to reduce taxes, as we did in the case of income tax and USC, for example.  Second, we were very aware of the impact higher fuel prices could have on people who needed to fill their tank and heat their homes, people who used gas and electricity, as all of us do, and people who needed to commute and had no other choice but to commute by car.  That is why we took the decision, for which we were heavily criticised, not to increase carbon tax in the last budget.<\/p>  <p>  We do need, however, to take climate action.  We are well behind in meeting our emissions targets.  We need to catch up and be honest with people.  The carbon tax will not solve the problem of climate change, but we will not solve it without a carbon tax.  It is and has to be part of the solution.  It involves three measures: regulation; investment in public transport and renewable energy initiatives and the carbon tax.  The whole point of having the carbon tax is that it is done in a way that nudges people and corporations to change their behaviour.  It makes it more economical to buy an electric vehicle rather than a diesel car and to invest in a fuel pump, rather than using alternative heating systems.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to pretend to people that the Government can somehow come up with &euro;50 billion, &euro;60 billion or &euro;70 billion to do all of it in the form of grants.<\/p><p>It cannot.  That is not true.  It it not honest.  The Deputy is not being honest and is not really on the side of the environment.  We cannot meet our obligations when it comes to climate change unless we have carbon tax, not as a solution, but it does need to be part of the solution.  I saw it suggested yesterday that the carbon tax might increase fourfold in the next budget and that this is somehow on the table.  I can say emphatically that it is not.  There is no prospect of a carbon tax increase of that scale or anything remotely approaching it being proposed by the Government in the next budget.  If there is an increase in the carbon tax - the budget has to be negotiated, as Deputies are aware - it is my strong view that the money should be ring-fenced and given back to people in the form of increases in the fuel allowance to protect those who are least well off, in the form of increased tax credits, and in the form of a dividend model.  That is the model I prefer.  I have no doubt that Sinn F&eacute;in will do what it always does, the populist thing, which is to peddle solutions that do not add up, oppose things that are unpopular, and still somehow pretend it is for the environment.  We all know the far left is anti-environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600006#D00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553610900,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Sadly, the evidence of this fee and dividend model that the Taoiseach is advocating, whereby people receive their money back on the carbon tax they pay, has been proven not to work.

It will not work for the very simple reason that we cannot change people's behaviours in ways that they cannot afford.  It may well be that the tax Fine Gael will negotiate with its coalition partners in Fianna F&aacute;il may facilitate the better-off in society to improve the energy rating of their homes.  They may even invest in an expensive electric car.  I can tell the Taoiseach that for the broad mass of people, that is simply beyond their reach.

This week, the Department of Finance and the ESRI have warned that a disorderly Brexit could cost this country 80,000 jobs.  Some of these job losses would be due to lower economic growth and lower job creation.  There is also an obvious real risk to tens of thousands of current jobs. What is worse, these jobs are concentrated in certain economic sectors and certain regions, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged.  Food exporters, many of whom only export to Britain, are particularly vulnerable to tariffs that may arise.<\/p><p>The UK has signalled that tariffs will be in place for dairy and beef products, but other sectors are also at risk.  Many manufacturers rely on materials and components sourced in Britain.  This is a reality of the global supply chain.  Those who look to Britain for imports will be under pressure.  Any tariff or restrictions on imports from Britain will impact on the capacity of all manufacturers to export to other countries, which will impact on their bottom line.  It will affect their competitiveness, including their ability to produce goods quickly enough in the just-in-time global economy.  Another risk to Ireland is the potential for collapse in the euro-sterling exchange rate.  Wild fluctuations could have devastating effects on many businesses.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party's core concern is the impact of Brexit on jobs and livelihoods.  The Taoiseach has made a bold claim that the Government will protect incomes and jobs and will support businesses \"whatever happens in the next few weeks\".  My understanding is that the EU has agreed to approve state aid to the value of &euro;200 million.  Is that the case?  With 80,000 jobs at risk, surely that cannot be true.  A total of &euro;200 million in soft loans is not enough, and it is not the correct type of support for the potential impact on jobs that would flow from a hard Brexit.  Labour has joined the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, in calling on the Government to make sure that at least &euro;500 million is available to the new Brexit preparation fund.

That element was increased by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, from &euro;20 million to &euro;200 million in the last while.  That is a particular instrument where money can be provided to a business to rescue it if necessary and to fund restructuring so that it can change the way it does its business to ensure its survival.  That is a particular instrument for particular types of businesses and mainly involves exporters not involved in the agrifood sector.  <\/p>  <p>  There are different supports in place for the agrifood sector, including farmers, fishermen and primary producers for the wider industry.  Those supports are provided by the Common Agricultural Policy and the CMO regulation.  We will require sums very far north of &euro;200 million to support incomes and save jobs in the agrifood sector.  I said at the weekend that if we end up in a no-deal Brexit scenario, no amount of Government intervention or State support will make it all okay.  I meant that.  It will still be bad.

As we are speaking, the National Transport Authority has outlined its latest paper on the next level of design options.  I have had a chance to read it online and we look forward to attending its session this afternoon with Members of Parliament to ask questions.  I hope we can agree, as we have agreed on the previous occasion, to bring this before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for a really detailed debate.  We all know the history of this with 20 years of planning the metro.  It was always planned to be extended to the Luas green line.  Real concerns arise that in a driverless segregated system, the section from Ranelagh to Dundrum, would have the serious consequences of loss of pedestrian, cycling and local accessibility.  We had expected some sort of response to that today to see what would be technically possible.<\/p>  <p>  The response seems to be to put it off for 20 years.  We will not proceed now.  We will run the tunnel machine beyond Charlemont to just south of Ranelagh and use it as a shunting yard while we wait 20 years before upgrading it.  That is not the right approach to take.  We need to be ambitious in public transport development.  What the Taoiseach said earlier about the climate is very true.  We need to do many things and so much more.  In transport alone, even with the MetroLink and the BusConnects project in Dublin, the National Transport Authority expects a 30% increase in emissions when what we need a 30% decrease by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to be open to looking at all options, including extending the Luas green line now if that is the best transport solution.  We should look at other solutions.  One of people's main concerns is that the lack of upgrade to the Luas green line will see people from Sandyford, Cherrywood and beyond, where large developments are occurring, not having a sufficient capacity to get on the line.<\/p><p>That is a real issue.  One option we could choose to solve that problem would be that rather than stopping the tunnelling machine in Ranelagh, it could continue on to UCD and from there to Sandyford, thus creating a new line that has heightened demands - UCD is a huge centre and there are others along that route &ndash; thereby solving that problem.  The other might be to run it to the south west to Terenure and Rathfarnham but, critically, we are in a consultation process where we should not shut out the options.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said last month: \"I won't countenance any project which comes up with a proposal which inconveniences commuters\" to the extent of a four-year closure, which he stated was possible.  He said: \"it won't be happening\".  Is that the last word from the Government on this issue or can we examine all the options in a sensible way to make sure we get a transport solution for south Dublin?  We will need the same for west and north Dublin and for every other city and every rural community.  We need radical ambitious plans for public transport to stop the &euro;2 billion cost of gridlock that is evolving, to tackle our emissions and to improve our quality of life.  Doing nothing or abandoning public transport projects should not be the answer.  Is the Taoiseach open to looking at all the options that are still before us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600009#G00500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553612700,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  First, to pick up on a theme mentioned earlier, I do not think we can meet our obligations when it comes to reducing emissions, taking climate action or satisfying the demands of young people who want us to do more around climate change without a metro but just like a carbon tax, a metro on its own does not solve the problem.  It only deals with one part of the problem but it needs to be all these things and not any one of them if we are serious about taking climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Like the Deputy, I also represent a commuter constituency.  Today thousands of my constituents will spend an hour or more in their cars or on the bus getting in and out of town, which has an enormous impact on people's quality of life, but things can be so much better.  In a city of this size we can have people getting into the city centre in 30 or 35 minutes, even from the outer suburbs, but that means investing in public transport and cycling and in projects such as the metro and BusConnects as well as, for example, DART electrification to the western suburbs.<\/p>  <p>  All the solutions are not in Dublin.  In order to solve our congestion problems we need to build up the other big cities and some other towns so that we have much more balanced development.  All the philosophy behind Project Ireland 2040 is about growing those towns and cities at twice the rate of Dublin.  Part of the solution to Dublin's problems is to develop our other cities and we are very committed to that.  It involves better planning in Dublin so we that have much more high density, which would make public transport more viable.  It also involves investment in cycling and public transport, as the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  I had a chance to meet the people in the National Transport Authority a few weeks ago to get a briefing from them as to what the direction of travel was.  My understanding is that the new alignment, which the authority is going to produce today, will involve some important changes.  It will protect the Na Fianna GAA club, which I am sure all of us will agree is very important.  It will also protect Kickhams, which is also very important, in order that the club can move to its new grounds and have new facilities in Ballymun.  It will change the proposal to tunnel through Ranelagh, which I believe the residents of Ranelagh will very much welcome.  Rather than going the full way down the line, the tunnel will stop in Ranelagh and the Luas south of there, the green line, will be very significantly upgraded.  The reason the authority decided not to go the whole way down that line is that it would involve closing the Luas for two to four years, which it had determined, and I agree, was not a viable option.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, notwithstanding the fact that this is a statutory process, we need to be open to suggestions as to where the tunnel should go from there.  The Deputy suggested Terenure and Rathfarnham but they have said to me that the density there would not justify it - we would have to put in a lot more high-rise building around there in order to justify it - but that UCD and Sandyford might make sense.  \"Yes\" is the answer to the Deputy's question.  I think we should be open to considering that but I would not like that to hold up the project because nobody is arguing against it in the airport, in Swords, Glasnevin, Santry or at the Mater - that entire area has been waiting for this for far too long.  I would not like anything to hold that up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600010#H00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553612700,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I fully agree; nothing should hold it up.

The advantage of running to UCD is that we could have a whole series of station stops where development is going to occur anyway.  To put the stations in at the same time as the foundations are being poured makes real sense as the numbers would be huge straightaway and it solves the problem of capacity on the green line.<\/p> <p> It is a statutory process.  We do not want to run the NTA's business.  It has to do the proper engineering analysis and this has to be done in the end with best transport engineering.  Where is the best place for us to have that civil debate?  It is not just obsessing about south Dublin, but south Dublin happens to be the issue before us and is where we will have a tunnelling machine coming across the Liffey.  We need to know what to do.

As the Deputy points out, the option of going to Sandyford solves the long-term problem of the Luas green line, so there is common sense in that, in my view.<\/p>  <p>  How do we take it from here?  Again, as I understand it, it is a statutory process, the NTA will publish the revised route today and there will be a further statutory consultation period during which people will be able to make further suggestions.

However, I would say this and I know the Deputy will agree with me: if we are going to examine where the tunnel goes south, let us not allow it to hold up the rest of the project.  Nobody doubts the need for it at Swords, the airport, Santry, DCU, the Mater, the north inner city, the intersect with the Maynooth line at Glasnevin and through to O'Connell Street, Trinity and St. Stephen's Green, and linking up with DART and Luas.

Among the measures that were approved today is an amendment to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to strengthen the powers of the Department's deciding officers to determine whether someone is self-employed, protections against victimisation by people who say they are bogusly self-employed, as well as the establishment of a dedicated unit within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to carry out greater inspections.

There is a terrible situation in Tallaght, which may be one of the first tests of the legislation.  In Exchange Hall, more than ten families have received eviction notices.  They are mostly people who work in Tallaght Hospital next door, they rely on a network for support of one another, and if they are evicted, they will find it very difficult to find other affordable accommodation.  It is clear that the landlord's motive is greed and that it is seeking to maximise profit and selling price by selling with vacant possession, given that the properties are being advertised as such.  The tenants are correctly organising and refusing to be evicted, and they will make a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.

While it is normally granted at the discretion of the employer, as legislators, we need to ensure bereaved parents will have one less source of stress at a time when their lives have been shaken to the core.  Owing to the lack of legislation there in a grey area in law. which is unfair on employees and employers.  As matters stand, those who find themselves in such a period of tragedy often do not know what their entitlements are and this can needlessly cause distress.  Often employers provide bereavement leave on the basis of <i>force majeure,<\/i>but it is often limited.  While some workplaces may also provide compassionate leave, it is very much at the employer's discretion.  Employees should not have to negotiate to take leave at a time when they have lost a child.  That is simply unfair.  While most employers are sympathetic at a time of such heartbreak, not everyone is and this needs to change.  The Bill is short and the purpose of the adjustment is not only to have a more compassionate approach adopted but also to provide clarity and for balance for employees and employers.  The Bill defines &quot;a child&quot; as a person younger than 18 years and includes a stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Michael Brennan reported in the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>that the extra revenue raised through the national training fund increases had been used to reduce the core contribution of the Government to third level institutions.  Is that correct?  In effect, there was a &euro;15 million cut in Government funding, which was offset by &euro;51 million in additional revenue from the national training fund.  Some &euro;36 million covered the cost of additional pay under the public sector agreement, while there was &euro;16 million to meet the cost of increased student numbers.  There was, however, no additional funding for new initiatives, which is not right.  I ask the Taoiseach to address that issue.  It is three years since the Cassells report was published in March 2016 on the funding of third level education.  There are big issues to be dealt with, but there are really important issues to be dealt with related to the future of third level education in Ireland.

It should be acknowledged that Dr. Scally has said he is encouraged by the progress made to date.  However, there are a number of issues raised in his report that warrant our attention.  He notes that a significant number of actions are due for completion in the second quarter of this year and that they need to be managed closely to ensure the timeframes set will not slip.  I was very alarmed to learn that there were few, if any, departmental staff for whom the implementation of the recommendations was their dedicated task.  Dr. Scally has warned that as the recommendations impact across divisions and units, careful monitoring will be needed.  Surely, given the scale of the challenges and the nature of the crisis and for the 1.2 million women who rely on cervical screening programmes, the Minister for Health should appoint staff full time within his Department to ensure the inquiry's recommendations will be implemented.  It should also be noted that the issue of open disclosure continues to present a problem.  Dr. Scally's inquiry described the policy and practice on open disclosure as contradictory and wholly unsatisfactory.  The Taoiseach might recall his commitment when Minister for Health over three years ago to enshrine open disclosure in legislation.  The inquiry found that there was no compelling requirement for clinicians to disclose.  Dr. Scally's latest report finds that the deeply flawed policy on open disclosure remains in place, which is not good enough.  It is unacceptable that the paternalistic model of relationship between women and their clinicians continues in the health service and that there appears to be absolutely no sense of urgency on the part of the Government to fix it.

It was agreed that there would be another major demonstration on 18 May because of the failure of the Government to address the housing crisis and provide the desperately needed public and affordable housing required to address the housing emergency.  I have to say one aspect of the Government's policy commitments has been talking about the social mix and affordable housing.  On Friday there were promises to provide 6,000 affordable homes with no fanfare and I am not terribly surprised when the contents are looked at.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, published the regulations on affordable housing.  We have been promised 6,000 affordable homes, but not a single one has been delivered.  We have been waiting for two years for the regulations, but what is in them?  There is absolutely nothing in them that will do anything to provide affordable housing.  They talk about 40% of the market price being the discount that will be offered.  In south Dublin the average house price is &euro;590,000.  A 40% discount will not help to provide affordable housing for those on low and average incomes.  As it does not even include income eligibility criteria, we do not know who will actually be able to apply and, most importantly, there are no affordable houses planned to be delivered.  Could the Taoiseach blame us for thinking we have to get out on the streets again in advance of the local elections to say the Government has failed, that it is not delivering on the promises it made, that there is not a single affordable home being delivered and that the affordable home scheme the Government is offering will not actually deliver affordable homes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600019#S01400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1553617500,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Taoiseach on the fact that in less than six months he has managed to reduce the claimed cost of his tax cut promise in half without changing anything about it.  At the weekend he claimed that there were clear plans in place for public services and social policies and that they all could be implemented and still leave room for a tax cut which supposedly is so significant that it is the only new budget policy announced since the budget.  People will be aware of a detailed and costed proposal that the Taoiseach developed in opposition before the last general election when he said he would abolish the universal social charge.  He said in an interview at the weekend that the Government had given very detailed consideration to the proposals and that it proposed to abolish USC at the cost of billions of euro.<\/p><p>Of course, it was abandoned as soon as the election came in afterwards.  On this proposal, has the Government prepared any particular study or is it still relying on the documents published with the budget last year?  We still do not have full transparency on the budgetary figures for next year in terms of what is available next year to spend.  What is the amount that the Government will have at its disposal within the fiscal framework and rules to allocate to services and to tax issues?<\/p> <p> In recent days the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has said once again she believes the pension increases for old age pensioners, which we insisted on in the last budget and the one before, should be reduced and kept in line with lower benchmarks.  The Taoiseach will remember that in August 2017, the Minister announced that Fine Gael was not committed to a pension increase of &euro;5 and that the money should go elsewhere.  After that bit of honesty, there was an attempt at a massive clean-up operation, which ended in the ridiculous sight of Fine Gael Ministers issuing press releases claiming credit for pension increases they had actually opposed.  The clear implication of the Minister's words is that this determination to reduce pension increases below levels received by other groups remains as strong as ever and is core Fine Gael policy.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Minister is not going rogue and that she has the right to speak on behalf of her party and the Government on pension matters?  If, on the other hand, she is going rogue and the Taoiseach does not support her statements, will he be taking any action to correct the record?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600019#S01500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553618100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>There have been increases of funding for the third level sector for the past couple of years running.

There has also been funding for extra students.<\/p>  <p>  I will have to check into the specific issue Deputy Howlin raises in respect of the National Training Fund money.  My understanding was that a 0.1% increase in the national training levy raises about &euro;50 million, which would be additionality and would not be offset by a cut in funding from central Exchequer, but I will double check that.  I do not think it is so, but if it is, I had better know about it.  I will check it out.  We have also identified a super surplus in the National Training Fund of &euro;300 million, which will be available as part of a human capital initiative for third level institutions to bid for.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of future funding, the model of increasing the National Training Fund by 0.1% has been largely accepted by employers.  I thank employers for accepting that small increase in the contributions and payroll taxes they pay every year.  It provides an extra &euro;50 million a year for higher education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600020#T00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553618100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>The Exchequer took it back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600020#T00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1553618100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>In fairness to employers, they recognise that this is an investment in their future workforce among other things.

I am very reluctant to go down the model of a student loan system because I see in other countries how that leaves students graduating from college with very large debts.  To a certain extent that is true in England and it is very true in the United States.  That has long-term consequences.

It is too early to read too much into that and there are other factors at play.  I acknowledge that.  There is very strong evidence now of a slowdown in house prices and maybe even a fall in house prices in Dublin, and a lot of that is connected to the additional supply.  It is not true to say there is not a single affordable home.  The average price of a house outside the Dublin area is &euro;250,000 and in many counties it is possible to buy a home for &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000.  I acknowledge that this is not the case in all parts of the country and that is why we need special affordability schemes in places like the Dublin area.  They are under way.

That has not been discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee, but it was discussed at Cabinet today and previously.  I am conscious that while nobody can condone the choices she has made and the actions she took in aligning herself with ISIS, a terrorist regime that is hell-bent on the destruction of the West and Christendom, she has a two year old child who is an Irish citizen.  That child is an innocent child.  As is the case with all Irish citizens they will be permitted to re-enter the State should they try to do so.  Of course, a security assessment will need to be carried out to ensure that Lisa Marie Smith is not a threat to any of us.  We are working out how that best can be done to ensure she does not become a threat to life and limb here in Ireland.  That does not apply, obviously, to a two year old child.<\/p>  <p>  I heard some suggestions that the Government jet might be used.  That is absolutely without foundation.  First, we do not use the Government jet to repatriate citizens.  Second, it does not fly as far as Syria or even as far as Turkey.  I do not know where that comes from, but it is absolutely not the case.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that she is in an annex to the Al Hol camp in the area of northern Syria controlled by Kurdish forces.  Another televised interview with the person in question was broadcast over the weekend.  Efforts are continuing to verify the details and make direct contact with her.  Consular assistance is provided to all Irish citizens abroad when requested, but our capacity to do so in an active war zone is limited.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless I am aware of the vulnerability of the two year old child in these circumstances.  The safety and welfare of Irish citizens is a priority for the consular service and the Government.  This applies to the case in question where two Irish citizens are in high-risk locations and wish to leave.  Officials from across Departments and Government services have been meeting this weekend to identify options to provide consular assistance to children such as these in Syria.  We will step up these efforts and work with international partners, including international organisations, to ensure that decent humanitarian treatment is afforded.  We will do what can and should be done to assist Irish citizens in distress or danger overseas, including by helping them return home.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about the Garda and its engagement with the Muslim community.  I cannot speak for the Garda, but I know from my visits to the mosque and conversations with garda&iacute; that Garda liaison officers are appointed to the Muslim community.  They do very effective work, or at least that is the impression I have.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton asked about the national security advisory centre.  That will form part of my Department but it will not be on-site as we do not have any room.  We are looking for off-site accommodation for it.  The reason it will form part of my Department follows on from the O'Toole commission, but more relevant than that it is co-ordinating three other Departments - Defence Forces intelligence, Garda intelligence and the National Cyber Security Centre, which falls under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  As it is co-ordinating the work of three bodies under three other Departments, it made sense to have it in the Department of the Taoiseach, rather than in one of those three Departments for obvious reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously Government acknowledges that Defence Forces pay is a major issue.  While we have been very successful at recruiting people to the Defence Forces, with record recruitment levels in recent times, there is a very high turnover.  The Defence Forces turnover rate is about 8%.<\/p><p>In the past it would have been more like 5% or 6% leaving every year, which would be closer to what one would expect than would be 8%.  As to what is being done about it, instead of having bursts of recruitment, there will be year-around recruitment.  For the first time, people can now re-enter the Defence Forces.  In the past if they left they could not come back.  Many want to come back and they will now be able to re-enter.<\/p> <p> Pay restoration is very much under way under the agreements we have with the trade unions.  The Public Service Pay Commission is doing a discrete piece of work on allowances that could be increased or restored if it recommends that this should be done and that it would be successful.  Also, I have asked the Chief of Staff to examine the issue of housing.  In the past, subsidised housing was provided on barracks and bases for members of the Defence Forces.  Often when they were saving up for a deposit they would avail of that.  I want them to consider that and see if we can do something similar on some of the bases where there is land in terms of providing low-cost subsidised housing for members of our Defence Forces, thus allowing them to save some money and build up a deposit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600022#V03500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553619900,"counter":249,"content":"<p>What about my question about Trump?

This is happening through increased engagement with stakeholders, an enhanced Brexit page on the Department's website, the circulation of focused trader notices, the establishment of a dedicated Brexit call centre and central email address, and the increased use of social media.  <\/p><p>In order to help mitigate the impacts on the sector, I have introduced a number of budgetary measures over the past three years aimed at helping farmers and fishermen, at improving competitiveness, and at supporting market and product diversification.  This included a &euro;78 million package in budget 2019.  This provided an additional &euro;43 million given directly to farmers, including &euro;23 million in additional funding for the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme and &euro;20 million for the beef environmental efficiency pilot, which complements the &euro;300 million beef data and genomics scheme.  <\/p><p>More recently - including on the margins of last week's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels - I have held bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on the impact of Brexit and the need for comprehensive supports to be deployed, in particular to mitigate the impact on the beef sector.

For him to try to tell us that the beef scheme or the ANC scheme is somehow related to his Brexit response is a bit rich.  Since October 2017 when budget 2018 was announced and published, he has been telling us consistently that the Brexit loan scheme he announced in that budget would be a key part of his response and preparation for a hard Brexit.  Yet today, only a few weeks from 12 April and only three days from the original exit date, where is that loan scheme?  It has not been delivered by him despite the fact that it was his response and first defence with respect to how he was going to do the devil and all to prepare for Brexit.  Likewise, last August, we heard him indicate he was going to hire 300 sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, officers but in September he revised that down to 114.  How many of those are available today?  The Minister cannot tell us because they are not there.  Again, we are totally unprepared.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is aware of the massive pressure the beef sector in particular is under.

I take the observation the Deputy made that it is long awaited but he will appreciate, in the context of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, that the reality is that many businesses, agribusinesses included, have pressed a pause button until they see the certainty.  The focus of the Government&rsquo;s endeavour has been on trying to provide certainty in an area where we do not control the levers in terms of what the UK decisions will be.  Our preference is that it would ratify a withdrawal agreement.  I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s rationale that it looks more unlikely.  In fact, more recent developments might suggest that the withdrawal agreement might be moving back centre stage again in the context of deliberations in the UK Parliament but I am very satisfied that we are ready.

Regardless of the issue or concern we would raise with him, his response was to the effect, \"Don&rsquo;t worry guys.  I have this loan scheme coming\".

Any tariff regime is unambiguously very serious for Irish agrifood exports to the UK and most particularly for the beef sector, which would be worst affected.

However, it should be stressed that no option would be as good as what is available on the table in the withdrawal agreement.

The UK has not done that.  Instead, it has taken a rather <i>&agrave; la carte <\/i>approach to tariffs.  Obviously, what we would have calculated on a full WTO tariff of around &euro;700 million on the beef side is somewhat less in the context of what it has proposed, but nonetheless damaging.  For example, on sheepmeat, it has taken a position to apply the full tariff because it has a significant market in France and it is trying to protect its home market, given it is losing that French market.  It has been designed to suit the UK's purpose.  Our response will be tailored and, obviously, the beef sector, because it would take the biggest hit, although not as bad as it could have been if the UK had applied full WTO tariffs, would have to be assessed as to what the price impact is for producers who are finishing cattle, and how we would direct responses to those farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600024#X00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1553620500,"counter":273,"content":"<p>We are all aware of the huge amounts of Irish beef that cross the channel to Britain.

Many of the workers they have employed are transient because it is not like the past.

There are very few Irish people working in them and most of the people working in the meat factories are Brazilians or from other countries because it is a low wage sector.  The danger is the processors could move everything, lock, stock and barrel, across the water and bring the cattle across to avoid these tariffs.  That would be very detrimental for a whole sector of our meat industry and for the spin-off it has in the economies where factories exist.

The exceptional aid was deployed previously under the Common Market Organisation regulation when the Russian market was closed and there was a particular impact on the Baltic states.

The Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agrifood sector, while also ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.  In 2018, live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 compared to 2017.  This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports totalling 58,000 up to early March, which is a 35% increase on the same period in 2018.

The development of additional lairage capacity is a commercial issue.  The live export sector may wish to consider developing an additional lairage in Cherbourg or engaging with the owners of existing facilities to explore the potential for additional capacity.  Notwithstanding this, there has been significant engagement with the French authorities regarding this matter.  In September 2018, officials from my Department visited Cherbourg to discuss the capacity issue with the French authorities and local lairage operators.  Last month, Bord Bia met local lairage operators, while departmental officials held a meeting with the IFA and French embassy representatives.  I also raised the issue last month with the French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian and last week I discussed the matter further with my French agriculture counterpart, Didier Guillaume, at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels.  I should make it clear that the facilitation of the French ministry relates to the approval of private sector developments.  Following this engagement, I am happy to report that in recent weeks the French authorities have approved an increase of the holding capacity of the Qualivia lairage in Cherbourg.  This will provide additional daily capacity for 400 animals.  Based on current ferry sailing schedules, this provides increased capacity of some 1,200 animals per week.

The Minister knows that the Irish beef sector is under massive pressure in terms of prices and the losses that farmers are taking.  The only good market in recent months has been the demand in Spain and Holland for dairy bull calves, which have been plentiful in recent years as a result of the milk quota having been abolished.  The Minister should have been working with the sector to ensure there were no blockages in terms of lairage capacity at Cherbourg that would limit the amount of animals that could be exported from the country.  Instead, he washed his hands of any role in this.  At the same time, he is trying to take credit for a belated and small increase in capacity.

Indeed, the 2017 figures saw an increase of 30% on the 2016 figures.  The commitment of the Government and Members on this side of the House to live exports is on the record in that context.  What I will not do, however -  and I hope the Deputy will not condone it either - is facilitate live exports through the breaching of regulations.

I asked them to engage with the lairage providers in France and told them to organise themselves so that they could share the facilities and sweat them to the maximum extent possible.

The development of additional lairage capacity is a commercial issue.  The live export sector may wish to consider developing additional lairage in Cherbourg or engaging with owners of existing facilities there to explore the potential to provide additional capacity.  Notwithstanding this, there has been significant engagement with the French authorities on this matter.  In September 2018 officials from my Department visited Cherbourg to discuss the capacity issue with the French authorities and local lairage operators.  Last month Bord Bia met local lairage operators, while departmental officials held a meeting with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and French embassy representatives.  I also raised the issue last month with the French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, while last week I discussed the matter with my French counterpart, Didier Guillaume, at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels.  I should make it clear that the facilitation of the French ministry relates to the approval of private sector developments.  Following this engagement, I am happy to report that in recent weeks the French authorities have approved an increase in the holding capacity of the Qualivia lairage in Cherbourg.  It will provide additional daily capacity for 400 animals.  Based on current ferry sailing schedules, it will provide increased capacity for some 1,200 animals per week.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy can rest assured that I will continue to advocate on behalf of exporters on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600025#Y02200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553621700,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the efforts he is making.

We attach a lot of significance to securing the maximum facilitation of trade, but with that trade comes terms and conditions.  In many respects, we are takers.  For example, if China determines that it will not take cattle under 30 months and that it does not want cattle that have spent the last period of their lives - 70 days - on one holding, or if international customers determine that they do not want cattle that have been subject to more than four movements, these are all conditions with which we, as an exporter, will have to comply.

The issue of the price differential between here and the United Kingdom is often raised, but it must be borne in mind that Ireland has to export 90% of what it produces, be it to the UK market or anywhere else; there is, therefore, a cost element.  There is also the fact that the UK consumer receives preference in the case of Red Tractor assured beef, rather than produce from other countries.  Ireland enjoys preferential status in the UK market, but its beef is not valued as highly in the context of the British consumer's preference for Red Tractor assured beef.  When I meet representatives of the meat industry, I repeatedly make the point to them that there would be no meat companies or meat industry without the beef farmers and that the industry must be conscious that this fact underpins the business.  <\/p>  <p>  I put it to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae that the position of sergeant for weights and measures is a thing of the past.  They are now functions of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  My Department has a function in the calibration of grading machines.  The payment arising from the grid system stems from a contractual arrangement entered into between the farm organisations and the processors, depending on where one's cattle lands on the grid which is complex.  There are 225 disparate categorisations.  The payment that follows, depending on into which slots the cattle fall, is an issue between the farm organisations and the processors as negotiated; it is not something for which the Department has responsibility.

Research suggests the biogas produced from anaerobic digestion could potentially play a significant role in the heat and transport sectors, in particular.<\/p>  <p>  The anaerobic digestion industry in Ireland is at an early stage of development compared to the more established industry in many European countries.  Potential for the growth of the anaerobic digestion sector in Ireland is strong, but it should be seen as a long-term development.  The main support for the development of anaerobic digestion will be through the pending support scheme for renewable heat operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  The scheme will provide ongoing operational support for anaerobic digestion biogas boilers or biogas high efficiency combined heat and power heating systems.<\/p>  <p>  My Department supports research, development and demonstration in this area.  As recently as October 2018, two projects were approved for funding from the European Innovation Partnerships Initiative under the rural development programme.  The Biorefinery Glas small-scale, farmer-led green biorefineries and the Irish BioEnergy Association's small biogas demonstration programme have each been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000.  In addition, my Department has a key regulatory role to play when using animal by-products as feedstock for anaerobic digestion.  We encourage the use and recovery of these by-products in a safe and protected manner and look forward to the growth of the sector and the opportunities it can provide for rural Ireland to meet renewable energy and carbon and emissions targets.  There are 12 anaerobic digesters producing biogas in operation nationally that are approved by and operating under licence from my Department.  The capital costs of such anaerobic digestion systems are quite significant and challenges remain in the sustainable supply of various feedstocks for anaerobic digestion.  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the lead Department in this area, to ensure the supply of domestic fuels available in the forest and agriculture sectors will be mobilised to support green energy generation from a range of bioenergy technologies, including anaerobic digestion.<\/p><p>It is the last clause the Minister read where the challenge is in terms of feedstock.  As well as looking at successes in other countries, there are areas at which to look which raise real concerns.  North of the Border, in Northern Ireland, there has been a massive expansion in anaerobic digestion, which seems to serve certain self-interested industrial farming production methods with knock-on environmental consequences which are very serious.  Research reports which I have seen show real concern about the availability of feedstock which would not if we, for example, used grass, kick into our ability to feed our national herd.  We have had fodder crises in the last two years.  There are potentially major knock-on consequences in the release of ammonia and the nature of the farming system one gets with this system.  I come back to my key question; what assessment has the Department done of the environmental challenge of developing anaerobic digestion without developing a massive and polluting industrial farming system to go with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600026#Z01000","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553622300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The issue is under active consideration in my Department and that of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, in the context of the overall Government plan on climate change proposals.

In fact, I was looking at some data and note it can cost anything from &euro;191,000 for a 4 kW anaerobic digestion, AD, plant to almost &euro;4.5 million for a 500 kW plant.  That is just the capital investment required and does not take into account issues around the supply of feedstock to sustain that and the renewable energy feed-in tariff scheme, REFIT, tariff that might be necessary.  Supporting capital infrastructure, ongoing supports that might be necessary through a REFIT tariff, the availability on a sustainable basis of feedstock, either animal by-products or in other forms and how that might impact on the availability of feedstock for the national herd are all part of the complex matrix of issues that need to be deliberated.  It is not possible at this stage to draw definitive conclusions other than to say that it is capital intensive and will have a significant ongoing cost.

That should be driven by environmental considerations first.  While capital and other considerations are equally issues, they are not the key issue.  We must ensure that if we are Origin Green in name, we are Origin Green in reality.  We must not make the mistake that was made in Northern Ireland whereby certain types of production are increased massively, which may be harmful in other ways, just to get an anaerobic digestion grant out or to get capital projects over the line.

Total Irish agrifood exports to Iran in 2017 were approximately &euro;11.5 million, the majority of which, or &euro;10.25 million, was accounted for by dairy exports.  According to the CSO, 26 tonnes of beef were exported to Iran in 2017, but there have been no exports of sheepmeat to date.  The role of my Department is to open up markets for the industry and it is then up to the industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of these opportunities.

Access for sheepmeat was officially announced in October 2016.  Therefore, these markets are open at present but the resumption of exports is a matter for the industry.  Limited or no exports to Iran can be explained by a combination of unfavourable trading conditions, cheaper supplies of beef from Brazil and of lamb from Australia to the Iranian market and financial barriers.

It is located 2 km from the port and I asked how we would manage to protect the integrity of goods in moving from one place to the other.  Did the European Union have a comment to make on the appropriateness of that facility?  Does the Minister still believe it will be available on 29 March or 11 April, as the case may be, if there is a hard Brexit?

As a result of the Commission's skilful handling of that, substantial commodities of skimmed milk powder were removed from the equation and this allowed the market to trade more freely without that depressant hanging over it.

The challenge for us, in the context of the UK market, is to keep our product there while we get to a situation where we negotiate a comprehensive free trading agreement.

The scheme was opened for applications on 28 March 2018 and will remain open until 31 March 2020.  It provides for loans of between &euro;25,000 and &euro;1.5 million per eligible enterprise at a maximum interest rate of 4%, ranging from one year to three years, with unsecured loans up to &euro;500,000.  The loans can be used for future working capital requirements or to fund innovation, change or adaptation of the business to mitigate the impact of Brexit.  Applications for eligibility assessment must be made to the SBCI which, on approval, assigns an eligibility reference number.  The reference number, along with the loan application, may be then provided to a participating lender.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 March, 523 eligibility applications had been received, of which 472 were approved and 9 were ineligible.

While the number of loans progressed to sanction level is relatively low, it reflects the current uncertainty regarding the outcome of Brexit.  The number of eligibility applications approved, however, indicates a good level of interest in the scheme and is a good indicator of businesses engaging in Brexit preparedness.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Brexit loan scheme, the future growth loan scheme has been developed by my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in partnership with the Department of Finance, the SBCI and the European Investment Fund, EIF.

The loans will be competitively priced, will be for terms of between eight and ten years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security.  It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.

This has been raised particularly by a lady living in Ballyshannon, Victoria Matthews, who has protested and campaigned very hard on this.  She is a wheelchair user.  She intends to do a course in the institute of technology in Sligo and there is no public transport to bring her there because there is no wheelchair accessibility on the bus serving that route.<\/p><p>When she started this campaign, many others in similar situations in many parts of the country raised the issue and there have been articles about this issue in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and other newspapers.  When we talk to people in Bus &Eacute;ireann the answer we get is that it is moving toward a situation where transport will be accessible to all.  To do that properly it needs, in as many places as possible, particularly relatively short routes, such as the one from Donegal to Sligo, to use the buses with low access.  When the bus pulls in a short ramp comes out and the person with the wheelchair is on the bus very quickly.  That is the model we need to see in most places.  Bus &Eacute;ireann in Sligo tells me it has several buses doing that but they are not allocated to that route and it says it does not allocate the buses to the routes, that is done by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  That is a disconnect that needs to be resolved.  <\/p><p>I am sure the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has a written reply telling me about all the places where there is public transport that is accessible to all.  There are many routes in rural Ireland like this one, where people in wheelchairs and people who have difficulties and disabilities want to access public transport, not just from an equality point of view but also because it would enhance their lives and give them a sense of a future by doing courses in college, as this lady wants to do, or employment opportunities they may want to take up but that they do not even consider because travel to those places is closed off as there is not proper access on the bus routes. <\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister's reply.  Vicky Matthews is starting this course at the end of next September.  We need to see fully wheelchair-accessible transport in place between Donegal town and Sligo IT, and Sligo town, on that route 480 before then.  I appeal to the Minister to make that happen. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600032#FF00600","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1553625300,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am aware of the campaign and the case to which he is referring.  Whereas we have concentrated and done an enormous amount for people with disabilities and there is no doubt about that, it is shown in the figures and the results, we cannot do everything and I cannot intervene in a specific case or route to satisfy one person, however awful their hardship.  That is not my role.  I will, however, certainly pass on what the Deputy says about that case to the NTA.<\/p>  <p>  What we have done for disabilities in transport, what the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport has done and what people such as Senator Dolan and the Minister of State with special responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, as well as others in this House who are involved, have done has involved making a great deal of progress but it is slow enough progress.  When a Deputy brings an impeccable and unanswerable case like that before the House, we will do everything we possibly can to see that as soon as possible, the Deputy will not be able to come into the House with cases like that and nor will any other Deputy.  There are multiple such cases around the country.  I know the Deputy is right about that because certain coaches are not fully wheelchair accessible but we are moving as fast as we can in that direction.  The Deputy's case, which is compelling, will be conveyed to the NTA and I will suggest that it should spur it on to further efforts to make sure the necessary measures are taken countrywide, which we aim to take as soon as possible. <\/p><p>I am not involved in the day to day operations of public transport.  This is a very good and suitable forum for the Deputy to bring up the case but he would not expect me to say that I will move and do something with the 480 route between Donegal town and Sligo, including access to Sligo Institute of Technology, this evening.  It is not something which is either within my power or would be possible for me to do.  What the Deputy has done is to highlight the case which is there, as well as others, who are undoubtedly in the same boat.  I have explained to the House previously that under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA has statutory responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network.<\/p> <p> In addition, the NTA has responsibility for the purchase of bus and coach fleets required by Bus &Eacute;ireann to which the Deputy referred, Dublin Bus, Go Ahead and other operators which operate subsidised public service obligation, PSO bus services on behalf of the NTA.  The NTA has advised that Dublin Bus and Go Ahead fleets are fully wheelchair-accessible by ramp.  All urban services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann are also fully wheelchair-accessible by ramp.  However, and the Deputy obviously wishes to highlight this, Bus &Eacute;ireann's regional services are primarily operated using high-floor coaches, which are wheelchair-accessible by lift.  In practice, lifts are less flexible than ramps as they require the removal of seating in order to accommodate passengers in wheelchairs.  I am advised that for that reason, passengers need to give Bus &Eacute;ireann advance notice of their intention to travel.  In addition, a large flat area of adjacent footpath is required to operate the lift, typically 3 m wide and 3.5 m in depth.  According to the NTA, in many towns and villages it is extremely challenging to achieve the necessary footpath dimensions for the vehicle lift to function.  Solutions such as relocating the bus stop to an alternative location may be necessary, but this can give rise to additional problems in that the alternative stop location may not suit other users.  In other cases, land or property acquisition may be required to obtain the necessary space, potentially requiring the exercise of compulsory acquisition powers to acquire the relevant lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600032#FF00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553625900,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I understand that while the Minister cannot specifically deal with this case I would like to broaden the issue out.  I met Vicky and other wheelchair users in Ballyshannon in recent weeks and they told me that if, for instance, they want to go to Dublin Airport on the bus, they can use a bus that has a lift to get onto the bus.  However, they feel this is most inappropriate because it really emphasises their difference in society because the bus has to stop and a huge area of footpath is taken up after which a ramp comes out and comes down.  As one of them said, it is like loading cargo.  It takes almost ten minutes for them to get loaded onto the bus.  Then if it is a long bus trip in particular, very few of them use it but try to get a train instead because at least on a train, there are toilet facilities, which do not exist on the bus.  The bus does not stop and if it does stop somewhere where they want to use the toilet, it is a siege and a half to get off the bus and get back on again.<\/p>  <p>  There really needs to be some joined-up thinking on this issue.  The Minister's reference to the National Transport Authority in respect of that is well and good but high-floor buses basically do not work for people in wheelchairs or for people with disabilities in general.  I looked at that bus that was being used in Donegal.  It was parked in the bus station in Ballyshannon on one of the days we were visiting the town.  I counted six steps to get up to the level of the bus.  Even if one takes away the person in the wheelchair, there is the elderly person and it is a serious issue for older or more frail people who have difficulty walking or using steps.  What we need to do is to quickly move to a situation where low-access buses are used in as many places as possible.  Particularly in the case of long journeys, if rail transport can be used and is more accessible, we need to make sure there are links to such transport for people with disabilities.  In some cases, one will be talking about going back to trying to have a taxi available to bring people to college and so on.<\/p>  <p>  In this particular case, there is a solution.  There are buses based in Sligo that have low access and if those buses are transferred onto this route, this issue can be solved.  I appreciate it is not the Minister's job to direct the National Transport Authority but at the same time, I am sure he could have a conversation with it, without directing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600033#GG00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1553625900,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Hopefully, the NTA hears what the Deputy is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600033#GG00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553625900,"counter":381,"content":"<p>So can the Deputy.  I am sure the NTA would be as accessible to him as it is to me.  I agree with everything the Deputy says.  I will not be content until we have got a situation where those in wheelchairs can travel as easily as we can and we are nowhere near that situation yet.  I am not saying anything in a mood of self-satisfaction but hopefully we are moving in that direction.  We have acknowledged it with additional funds and fast moves in the direction of greater accessibility but it is not good enough yet.<\/p>  <p>  Let me update the Deputy with the situation as it is now.  The NTA's objective is to upgrade bus stops, where possible, to ensure that all main towns have at least one wheelchair lift-accessible bus stop in each direction.  This programme is at an early stage.  The NTA advised that plans are in progress for the installation of wheelchair-accessible stops at Ballyshannon and Sligo bus stations.  However, according to the NTA, it is likely to be 2020 or 2021 before those works are completed.  The NTA is aware that high floor single deck coaches do not offer a good customer experience to wheelchair users, which is what the Deputy referred to.  While there is currently no viable alternative to the use of these vehicles on longer distance services, the NTA, along with Bus &Eacute;ireann, is implementing a change in its fleet strategy for shorter regional commuter services.  In future, an increasing number of these services will be operated by low entry coach-style vehicles, rather than high-floor coaches.  The NTA is in the process of procuring these vehicles, which are equipped with a ramp at the entrance door suitable for the mobility impaired and a dedicated wheelchair space within a low floor area in the front half of the vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, operators are responsible for determining the allocation of bus fleet to individual bus routes.  From a policy perspective, I advised the House recently that one of my priorities is to complete a review of existing public transport policy as committed to under A Programme for a Partnership Government.  This review is a significant and substantial resource commitment and my Department has commenced and substantially completed the research and analysis required.  I urge everyone, including Members of the Oireachtas, to take the opportunity to contribute to the public consultation and outline their views on all aspects of public transport policy, including in relation to accessible public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600033#GG00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1553625900,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Is the Minister taking the next matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600033#GG00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553625900,"counter":383,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600033#GG00600","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1553625900,"counter":384,"content":"<p>We will suspend the House for five minutes in view of the absence of any Minister to take any business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600033#GG00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553625900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.09 p.m. and resumed at 6.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","time":1553626500,"counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600034#HH00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1553626500,"counter":387,"content":"<p>There is a serious crisis in the area in which I live for people suffering disability who are trying to live at home and maintain a living standard in their own home with due and proper care.  There are nine community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas in the country.  I live in County Louth and represent part of County Meath.  My community healthcare organisation area also includes part of the midlands.  I had a constituent who, because of their disability, was entitled to 56 hours home support per week.  For days, they would lie bedridden with nobody to care for them or go in and out.  The other family member was away working during these hours.  The answer we were given as to why there was nobody to do the work, even though 56 hours had been granted, was that the only hours which could be allocated are recouped from existing service users and recycled.  In other words, somebody would have to die before that person could get the hours they needed.  It is not the only such case in this area.  At least three other cases have been brought to my attention where a person needed a significant number of home support hours and could not get them until another party died.  That is absolutely unacceptable, particularly in these days when, as the Minister of State knows and which I welcome, more money than ever is available to allow people to have home help.<\/p>  <p>  I refer the Minister of State to the spending review of 2018 entitled, Trends in public Social Care Service Provision and Expenditure for Older Persons.

There is a significant underspend in Louth, Meath and the midlands in respect of home care.  These are figures produced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform based on census data from the year 2016.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  I acknowledge and support the Government policy of a statutory right to home care packages.  I support people's right to have care in their homes, the right not to be forced into nursing homes against their will and the right to independent living as best they can.  However, it is not happening in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  I would also bring another case to the Minister of State's attention.  I refer to a child of six who has a rare syndrome, Pallister-Killian syndrome.  After they passed the age of five, 18 months ago, they passed from the care of the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation into State services.  For 18 months they have been granted home care hours but there is nobody to provide that service whom the HSE will pay.  This person lives in the County Meath part of my constituency and the services providers there cannot provide a qualified person.  There is somebody who is qualified for the Jack and Jill services, who can provide the services professionally but the HSE will not pay them.  That is a shame and a disgrace.  The family is in deep distress.  They have asked me to bring the matter to the Minister of State for reply this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600034#HH00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1553626800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position on the provision of home care packages for people with disabilities.  I can assure him of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing services and supports for people with disabilities, which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  The commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government and guided by the principles of equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  This year &euro;1.9 billion has been allocated for the HSE&rsquo;s disability service programme, which represents an increase of 7.5% on the allocation for last year.  It will fund the provision of a wide and complex range of services and supports for people with disabilities, including the provision of home support packages.  HSE disability services constantly review all allocated hours to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of resources in an effort to meet emerging needs.  The review of the current allocation is ongoing and every effort is being made to meet demand within the current available resources. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also working to improving quality of life for people with disabilities through the provision of home support hours.  In its national service plan for 2018 the executive&rsquo;s priority was to provide 2.93 million home support hours for over 7,400 people with a disability.  The actual number of home support hours provided in 2018 was higher; over 3 million hours were provided for over 8,000 people with a disability.  This reflects the responsive nature of the service and takes account of the fluctuation in assessed need over time, as the needs of individual people change.  This year the HSE is committed to maximising the provision of health and social care services, including home support services, within available resources.  In its national service plan for 2019 the HSE expects to deliver over 3.08 million home support hours to over 8,000 people with a disability.  This represents an increase of 150,000 hours on the last year&rsquo;s target.  <\/p>  <p>  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.  The goal is to help as many people as we can.  This is a positive development, on which we can build in years to come.  <\/p>  <p>  On the individual matter raised by the Deputy, I am sure he will understand my reluctance to speak in any great detail in the House about the specifics of any one case, given the personal nature and circumstances of the matter.  However, I am aware that a multi-disciplinary team meeting was held on 11 March to discuss the current waiting list in the County Meath disability service, with a view to the prioritisation and allocation of resource hours which became available this week.  Subsequently, the individual concerned was allocated 42 hours a week.  She will remain on the waiting list to be allocated the additional 14 hours.  The Deputy can be assured that I will take a special interest in the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600035#JJ00100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1553626800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but I regret that I do not accept the principle he is enunciating.

They have been called \"recycled hours\", meaning that they have been reallocated on someone's death.  While I agree and acknowledge that more money is being spent than ever before, it is not being spent in this area and I want the Minister of State to investigate the reason for this.  I have spoken to officials in the HSE who are also very concerned.  Why is it the case that the service in CHO 8 has not received an increase in allocation?  Why is there no money available?

That is unacceptable in our society.  I acknowledge the work the Minister of State is doing and the &euro;20 million in extra funding he is providing to keep people out of hospital and in their homes, but we are not going far enough.

The topic affects many people throughout the country.  The home support service provides domestic or personal care inputs on a weekly basis.  Temporary relief is offered to the carer by way of providing a trained, reliable care attendant to look after the needs of the person with a disability.  The service provides support for parents which enables them to spend quality time with other siblings in the family.  It also supports the individual with the disability in the context of his or her care plan, with particular attention being paid to the personal needs of the individual.  Home supports can be provided through a dedicated home support service or the generic home health service.  They can be an alternative to residential care where support for the individuals in daily living can avoid the need for a full-time residential service.  I assure the House that I will do everything in my power to ensure these services will be protected and I hope increased over time in order that more individuals can be supported.  <\/p>  <p>  On the specific case raised by the Deputy, the HSE endeavours to use the funding and hours available in the most effective ways possible.

It is the worst backlog I have ever seen in my time in politics and happening because there is a problem with the roof at Merlin Park hospital.  Instead of having two operating theatres, only one is operable.  There was supposed to be a quick solution, including the provision of temporary buildings.  Therefore, I find it difficult to understand why the building has not been repaired by now.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the roof of the operating theatre in Merlin Park cannot be fixed to allow operations to take place.  A temporary modular building cannot be put in as promised to allow operations to take place.  The patients do not care how it is done.  They just want it done.<\/p> <p> Many years ago when I was selling fencing stakes, I once ran out of them.  Somebody rang me looking for fencing stakes.  When I started giving excuses, they said something to me that has stuck in my mind since.  They said: \"&Eacute;amon, I'm not looking for excuses.  I'm looking for fencing stakes.\"  The people in Galway are looking for orthopaedic procedures, not excuses.  Some 2,000 people are in pain waiting for services such as hip and knee procedures, injections that have to be done in an operating theatre, operations on backs etc.  They want to know when they will be put out of their pain and misery and have the service provided.<\/p> <p> The past eight years have been characterised by more reports, more investigations and more procedures except for the procedures that are not being done, namely, the actual operations.  We have had every other kind of procedure to prevent from happening the procedures we need to happen - those operations on patients that need to be done to take them out of their misery and let them get on with their lives.  As the Minister of State knows, people waiting in pain often take a large number of painkillers etc. which can have its own effect on the body.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State has good news for me and a firm date for when we will start tackling these waiting lists, ensuring that the people of Galway and the west in general have a very basic service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600035#JJ00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553627400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Teachta as ucht an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; agus t&aacute; orainn go l&eacute;ir obair a dh&eacute;anamh ar son muintir na Gaillimhe.  I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  Of course, he has to be given a very detailed and considered response.<\/p>  <p>  Galway University Hospitals, GUH, comprises University Hospital Galway, UHG, and Merlin Park University Hospital, both managed by the Saolta University Health Care Group.  Merlin Park University Hospital provides elective medical and surgical orthopaedic and minor surgery services, renal services, including a haemodialysis unit, two designated rehabilitation units, and a number of specialist outpatient clinics.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, in September 2017, leaks developed in the roof of a building in the Merlin Park hospital campus that housed the hospital&rsquo;s two orthopaedic theatres.  To ensure a continuation of the orthopaedic service and with the support of Merlin Park staff, the hospital facilitated the transfer of elective sessions to University Hospital Galway, UHG.  In addition, some minor procedures were undertaken in hospital 1 Merlin Park.  In March 2018, remedial work facilitated the reopening of one of the two theatres at Merlin Park to restore service.<\/p>  <p>  To bring the services back up to full capacity, a tender process was undertaken to provide two modular theatres and a successful vendor was selected for the project.  Contracts were exchanged and were under discussion between both parties and a planning application was submitted in December 2018.  However, the HSE has advised that, unfortunately, contracts could not be executed, and after discussion with legal advisers, the decision was taken to terminate this procurement.  The HSE is working on a revised procurement strategy to restore full capacity at Merlin Park.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that patients are aware that services have continued to be provided at Merlin Park since the initial problem arose.  In the 12 months to the end of September 2018, more than 2,300 patients had orthopaedic procedures at Merlin Park.  Every week, an additional ten theatre sessions are completed, treating 44 cases on average.<\/p>  <p>  To address the waiting list issues immediately, the hospital is working to optimise current capacity to treat patients.  The Government is committed to providing timely access to treatment for patients and has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million this year.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published Department of Health-HSE-NTPF scheduled care access plan for 2019 sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  The plan will again this year place a strong focus on high-volume procedures, including orthopaedics.  When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than six months for hip or knee replacements.  The NTPF will deliver additional activity in the health service by working with hospital groups and individual hospitals as well as private healthcare providers to maximise the number of patients treated in both a public and private capacity.  I strongly encourage all hospitals, including Galway University Hospital, to collaborate with the NTPF to identify waiting list initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600036#KK00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1553627400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>It is extraordinary that in September 2017 there was a problem with the roof and it will not be solved by September 2019.

It is the county town and has a population of more than 17,000 people or 11% of the population of the county.  The last Fine Gael-Labour Party Government that was in office from 2011 to 2016 significantly damaged Clonmel.  It abolished Clonmel Borough Council; it closed the 50-bed St. Michael's psychiatric unit in South Tipperary General Hospital; it closed Kickham Barracks, a military establishment in Clonmel since 1650, with the loss of 150 jobs and approximately &euro;10 million that was spent annually; and it transferred the headquarters of the vocational education committee from Clonmel.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's recent decision regarding the municipal district of Clonmel and Cahir has made matters worse.  Far from restoring the borough council, it makes Clonmel the second smallest municipal district in the county.  It significantly reduces funding to the town and it reduces staffing.  As the district manager told the Minister of State recently at a meeting in the town hall in Clonmel, a practical example of this was where it had been proposed that the current scheme for the centre of the town enhancement programme in O'Connell Street, Gladstone Street and Irishtown was to be done over a five-year period, it will now take ten years.

This was around something myself and Deputy Clare Daly had discussed on Committee Stage with the Minister, which was effectively that, should an individual make a complaint, that complaint would be responded to in writing.  We were not asking that every single complaint be investigated thoroughly or anything like it but, as Deputy Clare Daly will agree, simply that a complaint would be responded to.  I want to correct the record because I did not mean what I said then to come out like it did, in that I had said that complaints were not being dealt with effectively by the DAA, when that was a charge some people were making.  There is now an opportunity, given there will be an independent competent authority, for this level of independence to be there.  What this is really about is ensuring that we are not watering down this amendment, which we had agreed in principle on Committee Stage.  The Minister had indicated on Committee Stage that this is something he would accept but his own amendment flies in the face of that.

I believe this meets the intention of Deputy Clare Daly's amendment.  In the first instance, under amendment No. 51, it will be a matter solely for the noise regulator to consider if there are grounds to review a noise assessment where circumstances may have changed.  It also gives power for the regulator to direct the airport authority to provide it with any necessary information it requires to undertake such an assessment.  Under amendment No. 91, any person can make a complaint to the regulator and ask it to review the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures in place.  This provides for a mechanism by which a person with a genuine complaint has somewhere to go and be heard.  Amendments Nos. 90 and 92 are consequential on amendment No. 91.  In summary, only the regulator can consider whether there is good reason to open up a regulatory decision in between the five-year regulatory cycle but any person can complain to the regulator at any point and request an investigation into non-compliance with a regulatory decision.<\/p>  <p>  I did not propose to mandate the regulator in primary legislation to respond in writing to every single request on the reasonable expectation that Fingal County Council would engage with people in accordance with its own existing citizens charter.  Fingal County Council's citizens charter, which is available on its website, sets out the quality of service that can be expected from Fingal County Council across all of its functions, including the availability of information, timeliness, complaints procedures and redress.  Primary legislation is not typically the place for setting out detailed administrative procedures such as this.  However, in response to what has been said on this issue and in the interests of transparency, I hear what has been said about requiring the noise regulator to write back to people who make complaints.  In response to the genuine concerns of Deputies Troy, Clare Daly and Darragh O'Brien, I am prepared to bring an amendment forward to the Seanad on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600038#MM02800","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1553628600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I do not know why the Minister could not have said that in the first past of his response but that is what we were looking for.

It is my understanding that all of these amendments relate to the issues of phraseology, language and intent.  In various parts of the legislation reference is made to the competent authority or the appeals body deciding that a noise mitigation measure should be put in place.  Such a measure is something that is of benefit to the community and it has been decided that it will be implemented.  This amendment, along with others in the grouping, refers to the language around instances where such a decision may not be implemented.  In essence, what the Bill says in various places is that the competent authority can &quot;defer&quot; the introduction of positive noise mitigation measures for a period of time.  We discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  There is obviously a certain logic around that because in some instances the measure simply cannot be implemented straight away.  We understand that but what we are trying to do by changing the language is to have a much more positive approach.  My amendments provide that the assumption should be that the noise mitigation measure is moved to be implemented immediately.  Instead of the term &quot;defer&quot;, which is a negative word that means to delay or put off, I provide that the competent authority can &quot;authorise&quot;, for reasons contained in the notice, a lead-in time for the coming into force of a noise mitigation measure.  In essence, what I am doing in all of these amendments is taking out &quot;defer&quot;, which allows a certain laxity which is not helpful, and replacing it with &quot;authorise&quot;, providing that the competent authority or the appeals body can authorise a lead-in time.  By doing that, the onus is on the DAA or whatever body is required to implement the noise mitigation measure to start straight away.  If the mitigation measure means that a building must be built, we realise that it will not be completed straight away but we want it to be started straight away.  The language is very important here.  The aim is to get away from the possibility of laxity which allows an out or a delay.<\/p><p>We must bear in mind that every delay has a punitive effect on the residents living nearby who have to put up with noise which has been deemed to be unacceptable by either the competent authority or the appeals body.  A decision has been made that something must be put in place to mitigate the noise, and what I am trying to do here is to make sure that the legislation cannot be exploited by an authority that wants to wriggle out of its responsibility.  The language is balanced in the sense of being practical.  We are not being ridiculous and saying that the mitigation measures must be implemented overnight.  We understand that some measures can take time, but the assumption must be that the implementation should start straight away, even if it takes some time to conclude.  My language is far better than that used in the Bill currently and I urge Members to endorse this group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600039#NN02500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1553629200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>We discussed this in some detail on Committee Stage.  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly that the assumption must be positive.  These amendments are based on striving for a balanced approach.  We want to take into account the genuine concerns of residents while the airport develops and while we protect, enhance and grow jobs and livelihoods.  As discussed previously, we are not saying that measures must be implemented immediately, although if they can be, they should.  If mitigation measures require substantial works on campus, for example, the competent authority can authorise such works and determine that they must be completed within a certain period.  Of course, some degree of flexibility would be allowed, as with the planning process generally, so that if something could not be completed, the relevant authority could come back and apply for a further extension.  The legislation as it is written at the moment means that the competent authority could decide to defer the works, and in that way positive changes could be left in abeyance.  The changes to the Bill are minor.  We are all on the same page with regard to what we want the competent authority to do in terms of making sure that mitigation measures deemed necessary cannot just be deferred.  This slight change in language makes a lot of sense.  It makes the Bill more positive and more focused on balancing the needs of residents and neighbouring communities with the needs of the airport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600039#NN02700","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1553629800,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Residents in the Dublin 15 area are increasingly perplexed by the Minister's approach to the Bill.  Essentially, we have a growing Dublin Airport and we want to see good jobs, good employment and the development of the airport.  The airport, however, is more and more looking to run very early morning flights right into the middle of the day.  Housing is developing in many different areas of Dublin 15 under flight paths or extremely close to flight paths.  Although they are aware that Dublin Airport is very close, people are concerned that when they finally get to buy their houses - which can be very expensive - there will be no indication and no information available as to when flight paths change.  I am contacted regularly by people who find that there are more flights flying closer to their houses.<\/p>  <p>  From other European cities we are aware of fantastic technical advances that have been made, and some technical advances have been made at Dublin Airport over the decades, such as changes to aircraft technology to reduce noise levels and running flights in a particular way to mitigate the noise.  This is well known with regard to busy airports around the world but some airports are better at this than others.<\/p>  <p>  We should strengthen the Bill in a way that will increase the right of householders to not be completely overcome by noise levels just because the regulation is weak.  When people currently complain to Dublin Airport, often all they get is an invitation to meet with somebody, but this does not go anywhere and their concerns are not addressed.  This is very important, especially as the Minister has chosen the council to be the regulator.  We have discussed this matter previously.  We all know the airport is part of the council's remit and part of the council's bread and butter.  We are looking at regulation by an entity that has a vested interest in the development of the airport.  This is publicly known. It is part of the council's job to ensure the airport develops appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  We want a clear indication in the language of the legislation to address people's concerns, particularly those people moving into new or existing houses in areas such as Hollystown, Hollywoodrath, Blackwood or Ongar where people are increasingly complaining about aircraft noise and have no proper channel by which to have their complaints addressed.  It does not seem this will happen in the legislation as currently proposed.  We support the change of wording proposed by amendment No. 55 to \"authorise\", which is stronger language.  The amendment is to even out the scales between the people who live in the vicinity of the airport who are subject to the noise, and Dublin Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, in their conducting of the business of operating flights.  It is also to ensure that when something happens or goes wrong, people have a genuine remedy they can access and pursue.  After the debate on this Bill, people's confidence in the quality of the regulation system nose dived rather than improved. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600040#OO00100","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1553629800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I too support Deputy Clare Daly's amendments.

It has been a while since we have had a chance to discuss the Bill.  I have taken another look at the European noise directive and the 2006 regulations.  It is striking that the regulations appointed the Environmental Protection Agency to be the national authority for all noise.  One of the fundamental problems with the Bill is that we do not have any information about noise levels.  What are the kinds of levels on the noise maps which circulate out from the airport itself? This whole area is at the heart of what we are discussing.  There is a later amendment from Deputy Clare Daly that is precisely on that point.  I believe we will have to come back to this legislation again in another D&aacute;il as it is fundamentally misguided.<\/p><p>I note that some of our journalist colleagues have reported - through a freedom of information request - in <i>TheJournal.ie<\/i>online newspaper on memoranda given to the Minister from his officials describing concerns about appointing Fingal County Council as the noise regulator.  The council itself had a fundamental concern that it should not be designated as the noise regulator for the airport because of the massive conflict of interest, of which we are all aware.  The memoranda from the officials to the Minister gave the Minister the lines of attack we on this side of the House would launch in relation to the conflict of interest.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes legislation that is not sustainable for the longer term.  There are those of us who want sustainable development of the airport region, of Fingal and of north Dublin and we want to ensure that residents have peace.

It is also astonishing that colleagues have to come to this House to table a series of amendments to ensure the regulator will take a proactive role in responding to concerns about noise levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600040#OO00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1553629800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this amendment.  This issue was discussed at length on Committee Stage.  Deputy Daly has pointed out the principle that in certain instances there will be noise mitigation measures that, given the complexity and the lead in time for construction, will take a period of time.  It is to allow - in those instances where there is a short or a long lead-in time - a period of time to acknowledge that.  In certain other instances, however, there are noise mitigation measures that could be done straight away.  For example, restrictions at a particular time could be done fairly quickly as opposed to building a large embankment that may take a number of months and might need separate planning permission to carry out the works.  To be fair, on Committee Stage the Minister agreed in principle with our proposal and with what we are trying to achieve.

The differences between the two sides are not huge, or the language may or may not be as important as Deputy Daly has said.<\/p><p>It is about how measures are rolled out and implemented.  The term \"defer\" which the Deputy wishes to replace does not refer to putting things off on the never-never.  The purpose of the use of the term is to give the regulator the necessary flexibility to include in a regulatory decision a requirement for the immediate implementation of noise mitigation measures and to set out future measures that need to be implemented in the event that certain activity levels are reached.  This is because it is possible that certain elements of a regulatory decision are triggered not on the day of the decision but at some future date or on foot of some future event.  For example, some noise mitigation measures may be triggered by a certain number of aircraft movements.  These sections simply allow the regulator to provide for that.<\/p> <p> I have examined the Deputy's amendments carefully and sought further legal advice on them.  I am advised that what we have provided is standard language in legal drafting and has been prepared in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is therefore more legally sound.  On the other hand, the expression \"a lead-in time\" while well understood colloquially is not typical legal drafting language.  For the same reason, the word \"defer\" is preferable to the word \"authorise\" in this context and in legal drafting.  That is my legal advice.  I admit that the distinction does not lend itself to the most satisfying level of public debate.  I hope, however, that we can accept that there is no substantive disagreement here and that this simply is a matter of better drafting.  Whatever is in the regulatory decision will have to be implemented.  On the more substantive matter, the regulator may defer, under the Bill as drafted, the implementation of a noise mitigation measure by the regulated entity but must specify the date or triggering event on which the measure will come into effect and publish reasons for any such deferral.  I hope this helps to clarify my reasoning in not accepting Deputy Clare Daly's amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600040#OO00600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553630400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Unsurprisingly, I am afraid it does not.  In particular, it does not help in the context of the fact that we obviously discussed these issues on Committee Stage and I agreed then that the language I was then proposing was loose and gave rise to some of the concerns the Minister has reiterated without taking into account the change we have made to tighten it up.  I do not buy the line the Minister gives because it is tempered by the second point.  All of the circumstances the Minister highlighted, including the right to have a specific date or the occurrence of an event as a trigger, are still in existence.  That is still in the draft as we have provided it which is what provides the legal clarity.  The change of language makes it much more of an exception.  In essence, if one has to authorise something, it is, obviously, an exception and the expectation is that it will be implemented as soon as possible.  Deferral, however, is something like a putting off.  One sees that if one looks up the definition in a dictionary.  We are trying to create a happier medium between the two.  The language I have put forward is preferable to that as it is much more positive endorsement.  If one looks at the phrases and the parts of the Bill where some of this comes into effect, there are sections on planning decisions.  If it is a planning decision, it should be a condition of the planning permission.  As such, there should be no deferral at all.  We are still giving the specific dates and occurrences.  They are all still there.  In some ways, these are technical things but they have to be rooted in what we are discussing.  These are public health measures to mitigate the impact of noise on residents.  We do not want a little loophole for someone to come through and delay that implementation while at the same time we do not want it to be so ludicrous as to be impractical.  This form of wording is different from the form proposed on Committee Stage.  It is a better balance.  It is clear to me that there is no legal impediment.  There would be if we had proposed taking out section 19(18)(b) but all of those things are still there.

It is particularly important because we are left with a competent authority based on the Government's advice which is in my view imperfect.  However, we have to work with it.  As such, we have to improve how the legislation around that operates and governs matters.  It is imperative that the changes here regarding \"authorised\" and \"lead-in time\" are actually made.  If there were some slight change to that or specific areas in the Bill where that caused a problem, I suggest it is open to the Government to propose any change in the Seanad.

One need only ask if he would be the flag-carrier for this legislation if it affected people over in his constituency.  It is unsatisfactory because of the arrangements around the authority which is to implement the regulation.  That authority is hopelessly conflicted for all the reasons we know because it is also the planning authority for the entity running the airport.  As Deputy Broughan said, that is unsatisfactory.  The Minister has been unable to adduce any clear evidence that Fingal County Council as regulator will be sufficiently independent to act vigorously in the interest of residents who are affected.  Currently, the whole area is undergoing a significant amount of building and there are new houses coming on stream in the vicinity of all the areas around the airport.  They are getting closer and closer to the flight paths but no one is clear about where exactly and how exactly they will be affected.  We are not regulating noise levels in this instance, as happens in other countries.  As has happened in other countries, there is a huge level of technical skill available for an authority working in conjunction with the airport itself and local residents.  Given the technological developments, it is possible to make significant improvements and reductions in the noise levels.  The Minister is simply going through the motions in relation to the Bill rather than taking into account that where someone is badly affected by noise, it may end up not simply disturbing that person's peace of mind, it may deprive the person of sleep and negatively affect his or her whole life.

I remind the Minister that before he decided to appoint Fingal County Council - bear in mind that no other jurisdiction in Europe has done the same - the European Union wrote to him to state the key element in making the appointment was the independence of the authority.  It recommended that he carefully ensure this independence beforehand because it could raise concerns at a later stage.  I guarantee him that it will raise concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Ryan is 100% correct.  The process is under way, but the House has not yet voted on the Bill.  Fingal County Council will be the competent authority if we pass the Bill and it is upheld in the Seanad.  If we do not, it will not be.  We are only in the middle of the process and the decision rests with Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's position on this group of amendments does not stand up to serious scrutiny and has not been substantiated.  We are talking about circumstances where the competent authority or the appeals body has made a decision to introduce either noise mitigation measures or operating restrictions.  All of the appeal processes are over and everybody accepts that the measure must be implemented.  I am seeking to avoid any unnecessary delay.  \"Defer\" is a negative and implies putting off.  The justification the Minister gave for why he had to have what was a lead-in time, in layman's terms, was that he wanted to have a scenario where the specific date or the occurrences which would trigger it could be specified.  They are all still there and my amendment does not change any of it.  The only thing my amendment would change is the word \"defer\" to \"authorise\" for a lead-in time for the reasons stated in the notice.  Instead of deferring the coming into effect, we would be authorising a lead-in time.  All of the other justifications the Minister said the Attorney General gave him would still be in place.  We have not sought to change them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600042#QQ01100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"vote","time":1553631300,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 54; N\u00edl, 45; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Clare Daly and Darragh O'Brien; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600043#RR00100","aye":["1368","1432","1238","1252","1361","1354","1279","1253","1220","1350","1335","1357","1263","1316","1258","1259","1288","1274","1441","1266","1360","1319","1348","1353","1345","1347","1362","1284","1283","1333","1262","1226","1433","1228","1280","1296","1302","1325","1291","1215","1269","1312","1287","1370","1366","1327","1301","1294","1276","1367","1271","1232","1235","1250"],"nay":["1246","1272","1310","1293","1369","1307","1260","1241","1273","1339","1286","1364","1261","1268","1338","1356","1322","1264","1300","1214","1233","1313","1251","1237","1249","1314","1240","1243","1337","1359","1290","1343","1363","1295","1234","1315","1328","1326","1297","1267","1329","1265","1334","1213","1277"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 56:<\/p><blockquote>In page 14, line 25, after &ldquo;notice,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a lead in time for&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS00100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 57:<\/p><blockquote>In page 15, line 3, to delete &ldquo;defer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;authorise&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 58:<\/p><blockquote>In page 15, line 3, after &ldquo;notice,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a lead in time for&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS00500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 59:<\/p><blockquote>In page 15, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:&ldquo;(23) In this Part, health aspects shall be assessed in accordance with the Environmental Noise Directive and the European Communities (Environmental Noise) Regulations 2018 (S.I.

Deputies may recall that on Committee Stage an amendment was passed to require An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where it had made a decision after its committee deadline for the making of that decision, to publish a written explanation as to why it was late with its decision.  It is a fair and reasonable addition to the Bill and adds another dimension of transparency to the overall process.  In moving the amendment I am simply bringing forward a minor rewording of the Committee Stage amendment to make it clear that the board does not have to explain the reasons for its lateness at the same time as it makes the late decision but can do so separately.  It is a relatively small point in the scheme of the Bill, but it is procedurally important because it covers a possible scenario where the board unknowingly or unintentionally makes a late decision and, therefore, does not explain at the same time why it is late with its decision.  The change of wording simply provides that the reasons for any such delay in its decision can be published as soon as practicable afterwards if the board has not explained itself at the same time it makes the late decision.  The scenario is highly unlikely, but we must legislate for it.  The provision is important to protect the validity of the final decision and will ensure a late decision will not be invalidated simply because it is not accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the lateness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS01100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 62:<\/p><blockquote>In page 19, line 38, to delete &ldquo;defer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;authorise&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS01300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 63:<\/p><blockquote>In page 19, line 38, after &ldquo;notice,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a lead in time for&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS01500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 64:<\/p><blockquote>In page 20, line 14, to delete &ldquo;defer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;authorise&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS01700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 65:<\/p><blockquote>In page 20, line 14, after &ldquo;notice,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a lead in time for&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600044#SS01900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553631600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553631600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 66:<\/p><blockquote>In page 23, line 15, to delete &ldquo;thereof.&rdquo; and substitute the following:<blockquote>&ldquo; &ldquo;thereof;<\/blockquote>(d) an interested party may directly refer the application in subsection (1)(a) to the competent authority in cases where the planning authority decides no such referral is required.

This means that, on enactment of the Bill, any applications that have not been decided under the said process will now be returned to the applicant with the applicant's fee.  If the applicant wishes to proceed with the proposal, it must make a new application directly to the planning authority which will then be examined by the noise regulator for any potential noise implications as set out under section 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600045#TT04500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553632200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553632200,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 85:<\/p><blockquote>In page 44, after line 37, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) The competent authority shall direct the airport authority to ensure that average noise exposure is reduced below 45dBL, and night noise exposure below 40dBL, such levels to be revised in accordance with WHO guidelines.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600045#TT04700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1553632200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 85 has already been discussed with No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600045#TT04800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1553632200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I do not think this has been discussed yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600045#TT04900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1553632200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>It has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600045#TT05000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1553632200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Why are we still discussing the Bill?

In reality, given that we are in a climate emergency, this Bill should have been law by now.  We should have been joining a historic group of countries such as Costa Rica, France, Belize and New Zealand, which, instead of being laggards when it comes to climate change, are world leaders because they did what this Bill sets out to do in its beautiful simplicity, namely to keep all fossil fuels in the ground.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Green Party for allowing us to take this motion tonight because we swapped Private Members' time with it.  This is the second time we have used Private Members' time to attempt to pass this Bill.  I would love to use this time to deal with the housing or health crises or issues of inequality all over this country, but, through a spirit of meanness, the Fine Gael party insisted that we use Private Members' time to move a simple motion that basically asks the Government to stop strangling this Bill and to get it out of the hostage hold that the committee has on it because it is the victim of an unprecedented procedural wrangle that has never happened to legislation previously.<\/p>  <p>  We are using our Private Members' time to try to get it out of this wrangle but I have to ask why that is.  Why are we so insistent on putting Members through a painful, repetitive and blatantly discriminatory wrangle of dragging us through and using Private Members' time yet again to get this Bill out of limbo?  The reason we are doing it is that this Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly's, party is held hostage by the fossil fuel industry.  The industry's record of lobbying the Government's Ministers, Senators and Deputies is second to none.  A recently retired adviser to the Taoiseach is now leading the lobbying in these Chambers and in the corridors of power on behalf of the industry.  It is no secret that he is leading that lobbying but is it not outrageous that the Government, Fine Gael and the Independents on the Government's benches would listen to him and the interests of those who make vast profits from oil, gas and coal, rather than listen to the tens of thousands of children who took strike action across this country less than two weeks ago?  These are the children whom the Minister, Deputy Bruton and the chairman of the committee, Deputy Naughton, stood smiling at, patronising and telling them how wonderful they were while, at the same time, the Government is blocking the exact thing that the children want it to do, namely to keep fossil fuels in the ground.  Their slogan was: \"We need system change not climate change! Keep it in the ground.\"<\/p>  <p>  What I found interesting coming back here was that a year later I had to ask myself what had happened in that year with all the licences issued for fossil fuel exploration.  When one looks at the record online, in the final six months of last year, a total of 12 exploration licences were issued, covering more than 15,000 sq. km offshore which belongs to the people of Ireland.  Some 15,000 sq. km has been practically privatised and given away to the oil industry to explore and to exploit.  Who are they?  Who are the faces who are using the lobbying privileges in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for their benefit?  Exxon Mobil is one.  It is facing losing its lobbying privileges in the European Parliament because its representatives failed to turn up for the first hearing on climate change.  Exxon Mobil is a climate denier and, interestingly, it supported the property tax.  This oil giant publicly supported the Paris agreement but has drawn the ire of scientists, academics and environmentalists because of its climate obfuscation and it is one of the companies that has been given a licence.  Another one, interestingly, is Nexen Petroleum, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chinese national offshore oil company.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will reply that if this Bill is passed, energy security for the people is not guaranteed.  I know that because Fine Gael repeatedly says that but the Government has no problem doing deals with Russian and Chinese owned companies to exploit the resources in Irish waters on behalf of private companies.  This is all apparently done with Fine Gael's vision of how to stop climate change.  I appeal to the Minister of State and to the Government to listen to the kids.  They get it; the Government does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600047#VV00800","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1553633700,"counter":587,"content":"<p>This is a pivotal moment in respect of climate change and the environment in Ireland.  To try to stop this Bill would be unforgivable.  The Government and its agents have done everything to subvert the democratic will of this House and this Bill.  The skullduggery and tomfoolery of what is going on has been absolutely shocking.  The process has been rigged from the very start to subvert that process.  It is not the first time.  Other Bills have been subverted, particularly in respect of medical cannabis.  Other Bills from Solidarity-PBP have been subverted.  New politics seems a very distant term that was bandied around this place.  It seems very antiquated and jaded.  I have said before that there is a democratic deficit in this House where the majority of Deputies who want to see popular legislation for the will of the people, this has been always subverted.  I would go as far as to say this Government has lost its legitimacy to rule.  Many people are looking on and asking about the effects on the environment.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, there has to be a reason the Government is so adamantly opposed to the Bill.  It is clear that the reason is there are vested interests, particularly oil companies, which have the ear of the Government.  The majority of people want decisive action on the environment by supporting this motion.<\/p>  <p>  The slogan of the environmental movement has been one of system change, not climate change.  To challenge that, we have to challenge the elephant in the room, which is capitalism.  Capitalism is the source of all the evils of environmental catastrophe and vandalism.  The pursuit of insatiable profits by oil companies and by the big multinationals in the world has brought the planet to the brink of a catastrophe.  Until we challenge that we will skirt around the edges of the environmental movement.  This comes down to ideology.  Fine Gael's ideology is wedded in the market system and capitalism.  The main thing that the environmental movement going for it is mass movement.  Greta Thunberg and the many people who have been at the protests over the past 11 days have been calling for environmental action.  Climate action and environmental justice are the new civil rights of a new generation.  This generation has become very politicised and radicalised in respect of environmental issues.  They are not going to accept the ways of the past.  There was a misconception that environmental issues were the preserve of a few people in the upper echelons of society.  That has fundamentally changed.  It is the preserve of the many of the people on this planet.  If the Government is the few, well, the few is up.  We have to change this planet and we have to change the ideology that comes with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600048#WW00100","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1553633700,"counter":588,"content":"<p>At least with the Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, we got the truth about Fine Gael's attitude to climate change and the establishment parties' attitudes to climate change.  Deputy Kenny went to Paris for the climate talks and he said simply and honestly - I suppose we can grant him that - that climate change is just not a priority for the Irish Government.  That was the truth then and it is clearly the truth now, as demonstrated by the actions of the Government in general on the issue of climate and in respect of this Bill.  The difference with the present Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, is not that the policy has changed one iota; it is that the spin and the rhetoric has changed as part of this image of a progressive, socially liberal leader on the world stage.  There is the idea that now the Government cares about our future and about the climate.  We have speeches from the Taoiseach saying we are laggards on climate change, which is correct, and that we have to change.  He was patting the students on strike ten days ago on the back and patronising them as he said, \"Fair play, it is great they are taking action\", and so on.  He is cynically using environmental arguments to consider again greenwashing austerity policies, as the Government has done in the past.  However, fundamentally there is no change whatsoever in the attitude of this Government.  Ireland is the second worst country in terms of meeting targets in the entire European Union.  There is a refusal to do anything substantial about it.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to this Bill, the Government is not just doing nothing but it is actively operating to subvert the will of this D&aacute;il and the vast majority of people by seeking to block legislation that has passed Second Stage through undemocratic, backroom manoeuvres.  It is an absolute scandal that the time of the D&aacute;il has to be used tonight to push this through when it could have been done without debate and we could have got on to debating the substance of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It is revealing about the attitude of the Government.  It is absolute madness that in a situation when we know that the current world's known fossil fuel reserves are four or five times as much as can be burned without destroying our planet that the Government would like to be able to continue to issue exploration licences.  It speaks to a deep blindness on the part of the Government and the political establishment.  This blindness is reflected around the world.  It is a refusal to take action both by those who do not accept the science, including the likes of Donald Trump, and those who claim they do accept the science such as this Government.  In a sense, it is even worse.  The Government acknowledges the role of human action in climate change but it will not do anything about it.  On the surface, from the point of view of humanity as a whole, it seems entirely irrational.  The actions of world leaders are equivalent to lemmings leading all of humanity off a cliff of environmental catastrophe.  The only explanation is that vested interests stand in the way of the interests of humanity as a whole.  The vested interests of the fossil fuel industry, which represent some of the most powerful corporations in the world with the greatest political clout, are fighting a rearguard battle in Ireland to try to prevent this Bill going through.  They are doing so for two reasons.  They want to continue to explore here and, perhaps even more important, they understand the international significance of the Bill if it was passed.  They do not want a message to go out saying that the rule of the fossil fuel companies is coming to an end and they are going to be restricted.<\/p>  <p>  It is a microcosm of the more general problem.  The science is clear.  The latest IPCC report stated that we have 12 years to avoid global warming going over 1.5&deg;C.  That is now less than 11 and a half years.  After that, another 0.5&deg;C increase would have absolutely devastating consequences such as sea level rises affecting 10 million people, 99% of coral being damaged and insects wiped out.  Humanity has managed to cause the extinction of 83% of the world's mammals.  The current level of commitments from governments worldwide, which are not even being kept, would result in a 3&deg;C rise.  In terms of what is being done, we are heading for a 4&deg;C to 5&deg;C increase in temperature, which would be devastating for our planet and for the people and species living on it.  Fundamentally, capitalism stands in the way.  The drive for private property and those people who control the economy and make the decisions about how our world works stand in the way of doing what is rational from the point of view of society and humanity as a whole.  That is precisely why a movement is essential.  Without a movement, capitalist governments around the world will not move a single inch.  It is why the school students' strikes ten days ago were so impressive, impactful and important.  We had about 1.5 million school students taking strike action in the biggest global day of school student strike action ever seen in the history of the world.<\/p><p>More than 10,000 - perhaps as many as 15,000 - young people in Dublin and 5,000 to 7,000 across the country were involved.  These young people are leading the way, and have already forced the resignation of the Belgian climate minister.  She will not be the last minister to be claimed by this movement for refusing to do what is necessary.<\/p> <p> We have to argue that others follow the lead.  The Government should be following the lead, but we know what interest stands in the way.  We also have to argue that trade unions follow that lead.  Workers should have a vital interest in a plan for a rapid and just transition to a zero-carbon economy.  Workers in unsustainable industries should be guaranteed a transfer to a good job in a sustainable sector.  That movement must be armed with an eco-socialist programme.  These are the only policies that give us a chance to achieve what the science clearly says we need to achieve in a very small space of time.  We have to pass the legislation required to keep fossil fuels in the ground.  It is absolute madness that we would consider extracting and burning more fossil fuels.  We have to re-nationalise the fossil fuels that exist in this country and keep them all in the ground.<\/p> <p> Other policies are needed.  We need free public transport.  We have to get people out of cars and into properly funded, free, quality public transport served by well-paid workers with decent conditions.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, recently told us that this would cost &euro;600 million, which is the same figure we could be facing in fines from the EU because of our lack of action on climate change from next year.  We need a massive home retrofitting programme.  Ireland has the worst emissions from households in the European Union - some 60% more than average - because the quality of our house-building is so poor.  A massive programme of retrofitting, including solar panels and insulation, is needed.  We need a programme of transition in agriculture to transform our biggest emitting sector.  It is completely unsustainable.  This should be done on the basis of public ownership of big agribusinesses and a different model of grants, which would enable the shift to a fundamentally different model of agriculture from what we currently have.  <\/p> <p> The fundamental point is that we need to have a societal change.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, the dominant slogan on the climate change march was \"system change, not climate change\".  The system standing in the way is capitalism, and in my view the change we need to see is socialist change.  This is fundamentally captured by the idea that we know the 100 corporations responsible for the 71% of emissions.  We know who they are., what they have done and why they have done it.  It has been done to maximise profits, and because capitalism treats the environment as an externality that those companies simply do not have to care about.  The economy cannot continue in the same way if we are to have the rapid transition we require.  The idea that these polluting companies, in private ownership, are going to change in the necessary way in the next 12 years is incorrect; it is not going to happen.  In order to preserve a habitable world we need to take those companies into public ownership and democratic control so that we can rationalise, reprioritise and restructure production to create a permanently sustainable economy.  It is simply not possible for an economy based on private ownership as a means of production to undergo the rapid transition required.  A democratically planned economy is required in order to suppress fossil fuel extraction and usage and to transition quickly and justly to a renewables-based economy.  <\/p> <p> Karl Marx outlined that even an entire society, a nation or all simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not the owners of the earth.  They are simply its possessors, its beneficiaries and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations.  It is only on the basis of those eco-socialist policies that that bequeathing can take place.  Capitalism has outlived its usefulness for humanity.  This is nowhere better demonstrated than the climate crisis we are in.  It has destroyed our environment and disrupted our climate.  It has relegated a billion people to the point of slow death by starvation and malnutrition.  It offers no way forward.  Instead, we need a rapid and just transition to an economy based on zero emissions.  This means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, investing in the transition to renewable energy, passive houses, retrofitting, free public transport and democratic planning over our economy in order to meet the needs of people and the planet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600048#WW00200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553634300,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;recognises that climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity on a global scale and it is vital that Ireland plays a strong role in addressing it;<br \/><br \/>-notes that Ireland is expected to only achieve a single per cent reduction by 2020 against its non-Emissions Trading Scheme target of a 20 per cent reduction;<br \/><br \/>-acknowledges that there is a need to step up Ireland&rsquo;s progress and ambition in this area;<br \/><br \/>-welcomes the significant increase in the share of electricity from renewable sources which now account for 30 per cent of total electricity demand, and calls on the Government to set an ambitious target for 2030;<br \/><br \/>-notes the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption across the entire economy in order to make progress towards the national transition objective of a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050;further recognises that:-the transition to a low-carbon economy is a transition for all of Ireland&rsquo;s citizens and, therefore, its socio-economic impacts must be carefully managed; and<br \/><br \/>-the response to climate change will require difficult choices and that every person, community, business, home, farm and school will have to make changes in their day-today activities;<br \/><br \/>-recalls the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly report on how the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change, including the 17 recommendations made by the members of the Assembly;<br \/><br \/>-also recalls the establishment of the Oireachtas Special Joint Committee on Climate Action to consider the report and recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly;<br \/><br \/>-looks forward to all-party support for the Special Joint Committee&rsquo;s report, its conclusions and recommendations; and-calls on the Government to urgently bring forward an all-of-Government plan which will set out the actions that must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change and providing for a significant increase over the next decade in the level of renewable energy in our energy mix.<\/blockquote><p>We are all agreed on the destination we need to arrive at as a country in terms of the objective of a competitive, low carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  It is also recognised that there is a need to step up Ireland&rsquo;s progress and ambition in this area.  In terms of the how we get there, and with this Bill specifically, there is clearly a difference in approach.<\/p><p>At its meetings on 18 December 2018 and 19 February 2019, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment was not able to adopt a pre-legislative scrutiny report on this Bill.  The Government did not vote to progress the Bill as it does not support it, for reasons I will go into shortly.  The clerk to the committee has confirmed that all the rules have been followed correctly.  <\/p><p>The motion put down by People Before Profit does not relate to the content of the Bill itself, but rather proposes to bypass the agreed Standing Orders of the House.  Clearly, we would have a concern if we move to a situation where the agreed Standing Orders could be changed on a case-by-case basis.  Such an approach could make the work of this House very difficult.  <\/p><p>We have outlined previously the fundamental issues we have with this Bill.  It is not seeking to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s emissions, and does not help us reach our 2020 or 2030 emissions targets.  It is simply forcing Ireland to import the fossil fuels it uses.  It seeks to commit Ireland to this course of action at a time when the Kinsale gas fields are due to cease production in the very near future and Corrib production is already in decline.<\/p><p>The EU&rsquo;s import dependency for natural gas has increased from 43% in 1995 to 70% in 2016, and its import dependency for petroleum and petroleum products reached 87%.  The Bill is, therefore, a conscious decision by Ireland to rely on a relatively small number of petroleum provinces, many located in areas of political instability, for our future oil and gas supplies.  The reality is that all credible forecast models, such as those of the International Energy Agency, show that we will continue to need some fossil fuels when meeting the ambition set out in the Paris Agreement.  The agency sees the need for continued investment in oil and gas projects to meet energy demand, even in deep decarbonisation scenarios.  It also identified a continuing and growing need for oil and gas as non-energy raw materials for many products.  <\/p><p>In a European context, the UK, Norway, and Denmark, as well as Ireland, continue to explore and produce natural gas and oil to help meet a part of Europe's future energy needs, and reduce energy imports from Russia and the Middle East, while Europe plays a leading role globally in the transition to a low-carbon future.  Within that context, it is accepted that Ireland will continue to require and use some, but significantly reduced, fossil fuels to meet the needs of our people, farmers and industry.  We cannot ignore this fact and look to address any concerns with producing oil and gas by leaving it up to other States to deal with it.  It must also be pointed out that countries such as Ireland which are in the European Union have a much higher level of environmental regulation than many of the oil and gas provinces across the world.  It is not reasonable to take a measure which will not reduce our emissions but at the same time will reduce the State&rsquo;s energy security.  <\/p><p>However, we clearly must reduce our fossil fuel consumption across the entire economy.  This will reduce our emissions and, at the same time, improve our energy security by further reducing our energy imports.  In that light, the Government has tabled a countermotion, which recognises that urgent actions in respect of climate action must be taken and done so in a comprehensive way that respects our energy security and affordability of energy to our citizens.  The motion recognises that climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity on a global scale and that there is a need to step up Ireland&rsquo;s progress and ambition in this area.  Specifically, it calls on the Government to urgently bring forward an all-of-Government plan which will set out the actions that must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change and providing for a significant increase over the next decade in the level of renewable energy in our energy mix.<\/p><p>I can confirm that the plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery.  The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries.  This plan will build on the previous actions taken by the Government, including in the national mitigation plan and the national development plan, and is to be completed shortly.  In developing the plan, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, intends that it will address any recommendations that the joint committee includes in its report.  These real, tangible, decisive actions will reduce our emissions.  For example, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced on Monday that as part of the all-of-Government climate plan, we are stepping up our ambition on renewable electricity. <\/p><p>Currently 30% of our electricity comes from renewable sources.  The Minister said he will put in place the actions necessary to deliver 70% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  This will have a transformative impact on our carbon emissions.<\/p> <p> Similarly a range of measures have been put in place for those buying electric cars, such as a purchase grant, VRT relief and toll discounts.  The Minister recently approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network.  We are starting to see results with the number of electric vehicles on the road having doubled in the past year.  Furthermore, CSO figures published last week show more than 1,400 new electric vehicles have been licensed in the first two months of 2019.  This is more than four times the number licensed in the same two months of last year.<\/p> <p> We must continue to roll-out these types of measures, which in some cases will require difficult choices.  The reality is every person, community, business, home, farm and school will have to make changes in their day-to-day activities.<\/p> <p> The motion put forward to progress the Bill will not in practical terms reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  It will not change our use of fossil fuels.  What it will do is eliminate potential secure sources of supply for both Ireland and the European Union.  I believe the course of action set out in the Government's amendment offers a considerably better path for Ireland to step up progress and ambition in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600049#XX00200","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553634900,"counter":592,"content":"<p>As a member of the committee that has been debating this issue at length for the past two years and in more recent months has been debating the issue in detail and indeed the procedural issues which are at the heart of the motion before us, I know only too well the issues at play in the very important wider climate-action debate and the necessity for urgent action in what is an emergency situation.<\/p><p>Before I deal with the substance of the Bill, it is important to address the procedural and technical matters at the heart of tonight's motion.  It is critical to address that procedural issue not just for this Bill but for many similar Bills before the House.  New politics has promised much but delivered little.  New politics promised and still contains an opportunity for a separation of powers to be manifested within these Houses.  The notion, as reflected in our Constitution, that we have an Executive, a Judiciary and a Parliament all equal but opposite holding each other to account, which is a paramount principle of modern parliamentary democracy, is one that we should hold dear and execute, but unfortunately it has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance for most of the time of the State because we have had majority governments.<\/p><p>The job of the Legislature is to legislate, but with all-powerful executives with majorities in the House, that has not been the experience in many D&aacute;ileanna.  This is the first D&aacute;il where the numbers dictate that that can come into being.  However, despite having an arithmetic that Private Members' Bills can and should be brought before the House, be debated and progressed on the basis of their policy merit rather than the colour of the banner under which they come, the experience over the past three years is that procedural devices and technical amendments are found to frustrate Bills.  Given that the Government can no longer command a majority in the House, it cannot simply vote down a measure from the other side.  Instead things like money messages, procedural matters, voting arrangements and technical reasons are put forward to delay and frustrate legislation.<\/p><p>I have four Private Members' Bills before the House at different Stages.  There are many Bills in areas such as the education, environment and housing, and some Deputies have already mentioned other examples.  It is as critical for those Bills as it is for this Bill that we address the procedural lacuna and send a message to Government that it is not good enough to delay and frustrate Private Members Bills <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  I commend the Deputies who introduced this motion to try to address the deadlock, which is not a good state of affairs.<\/p><p>On the substantive matter, I joined students from four schools outside Naas on Friday, 15 March.  These young people came out to take a stand and make their views known that enough is enough.  They wanted to plead with us to state their significant concern at the failure of many before their generation to protect and safeguard the planet they will inherit.  I am very proud that my daughter, Niamh, was among those who travelled up by bus from Naas to Leinster House and stood outside the gates to be part of that protest movement, joining many hundreds of thousands if not millions of others worldwide on the same day as part of a growing movement because their generation understands this is a real climate emergency, probably the most significant issue to face our planet at this time.  They are saying enough is enough.<\/p><p>We know from the academic literature that climate change is real.  We understand that the increase in global temperature in the 150 or 200 years since the Industrial Revolution has been greater than in the previous two millennia.  We know this is not sustainable.  We know that the time for action is now.  That has been borne out by many academic experts at the committee.  We have engaged.  The suggestion from some quarters that this is a rushed Bill is just untrue.  The reality is we have had substantive policy debates at the committee with relevant national and international academic experts and we have had the technical argument.<\/p><p>Professor John Sweeney from NUI Maynooth pointed out that Ireland is 27th out of 28 EU countries in our performance on climate change.  Behind us is only Poland, which has a natural dependency on coal given its geography.  Second bottom of the league table is not where we want to be.<\/p><p>Even if we were to disregard the academic experts and to accept there are experts on both sides, which is the case, we only need to use the evidence of our own eyes.  Last year we had the beast from the east which was followed just a few months later by the drought from the south.  We had two of the most extreme weather situations in living memory - if not longer - occurring in the past 18 months.  The proof is there for all of us to see.  Our young people get it; the Opposition in this House gets it; it is time for the Government to get it and start to take these issues seriously and respond on them.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to my colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I pay tribute to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith for proposing the Bill and all the members of the committee who have engaged in substantive debate on these issues.  I also pay tribute to civic society groups such as Tr&oacute;caire, Stop Climate Chaos, Friends of the Earth and many other advocacy groups that have played such a significant part in creating the context and raising the ante to highlight these issues and insist on getting them to this stage.  That has been a crucial part of the momentum on this Bill and other Bills such as the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill we passed last summer.  Momentum is building all the time.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will support the motion.  It is important to uphold the principle that the D&aacute;il cannot be frustrated by technical manoeuvres in committee and elsewhere.  However, it is not a complete unconditional support.  We will be introducing amendments in committee.  We will look forward to robust substantive engagement on Committee Stage.  We need to recognise some of the concerns raised relating to energy security, continuity of supply and external sources that may be less preferable to meet our energy needs.  It is important that we manage that transition in a responsible way and recognise the unfortunate reality that there will be dependence on traditional fossil fuels for some time to come.  We will be engaging in committee on those points.<\/p><p>If we were to repeat the mistakes of the past by continuing to look for something else before we put a lid on it, that is a self-fulfilling myth.  If we keep on searching and even if we keep finding, we are generating and propagating an industry that will propel itself.  If we are to continue to extract and explore, continue the cycle, create jobs and create a local economy based on that industry, it becomes a self-perpetuating myth and we never begin to make transition away from it.  It is vital that we begin to make that transition now.<\/p><p>There is an entire false economy there.  We can have a far more successful, sustainable, future-proofed, engineering-based technology solution of a green revolution if we embrace renewable energy and all the potential it offers.<\/p><p>That, in itself, is a major potential source of economic activity and growth in the regions where it is based and nationally by contributing to GDP.<\/p> <p> A point was made regarding the potential loss to the State if we were to turn our backs on potential untapped reserves.  Apart from the question as to where we should stop in the self-perpetuating cycle, there is also the opportunity cost of presented by a green revolution.  A moot question, one which was discussed by the joint committee, is that if there are vast energy resources off our coast, why have we not found them in the past 50 years?  The Corrib field, which is being wrapped up, has been loss-making and there have been a few other smaller finds.  We have had 50 years to find these resources, which has been plenty of time.  We will soon have to draw a line in the sand and say we have reached a point of no return.  We have plenty of wind and wave energy off the Atlantic coast.  Being on the edge of Europe, we have plenty of potential green energy.  A small number of wind turbines off the Atlantic coast would generate 5 GW of energy, which would be enough to meet the country's energy needs.  Other solutions include solar, biomass and wave energy.  There are major untapped resources available.  We need to change the mindset and culture and make the transition because we cannot sit on our hands and delay action forever.<\/p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support the motion proposing that the Bill proceed to the next Stage.  It is important the House asserts itself on matters such as this and on similar Private Members' Bills.  We have engaged substantively on the issue and we support the broad thrust of the Bill.  We will table amendments on energy security and the time cycle for the transition phase and engage on those issues in committee.  For now, however, I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600050#YY00200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553635500,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Brian Stanley who I understand is sharing his time with Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1553635500,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion.  We are all aware of the global climate problems we face and the need to move away from extracting fossil fuels.  We have been extracting these fuels for decades with only limited benefits for the State and members of the public.  Corporations have benefited most because successive Governments have presided over among the worst deals on royalties from gas in the world.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the burning of fossil fuels, we are linked to the petrochemical industry in the western world.  What solutions have been put forward?  It is vital there are solutions and alternatives.  What are the realistic specific replacements for fossil fuels?  What exactly are the renewable energy sources that will be put in place?  It is one thing to ban fossil fuels but the environmental problems we have will only be solved when we bring forward some alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the general thrust of the Bill, although it will require some amendments.  We need to set in motion the renewable technologies that will replace fossil fuels.  It would be completely immoral and foolish to stop using gas extracted here, while continuing to use gas and coal produced elsewhere in the short term because we have not developed replacement energies.  We must develop a wide variety of renewable sources such as offshore wind, solar, microgeneration, biogas, biomass and hydro energy.  What solutions have been put forward in the House?  The major solution currently being put forward seems to be to introduce another layer of tax.  Will it be acceptable in future to drive electric cars powered by electricity generated from fossil fuels or nuclear power in England, Scotland or Wales and delivered to us through interconnectors?<\/p>  <p>  We should have a vision to produce our own energy and become an exporter of renewable energy.  This means we must specify replacement sources of energy.  We urgently need to start developing a biogas industry and to develop offshore wind, solar, hydro, wave, biomass and other energy sources.  Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined how we would do this in a detailed paper, Powering Ireland 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Electricity accounts for only some of our consumption of fossil fuels.  What are we doing about transport, which accounts for 40% of the energy we use?  Our public transport network is almost completely reliant on fossil fuels.  There is no plan or strategy for the public charging system for electric vehicles, which does not exist in many parts of the country.  Public transport needs to be more widely available and properly planned, including in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Governments have had little vision or direction for renewable energy.  We now face the moment of truth.  We need to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, which cost almost &euro;5 billion per annum.  We need to change not only for sake of the environment or to be self-sufficient but also because we face fines as a result of our miserable failure to meet our 2020 obligations on greenhouse gas emissions reductions and renewable energy production.  It is estimated that these fines will cost hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Bill opens up a debate and that we can legislate on what will replace fossil fuels.  Without a rapid change in policy and direction, we will continue to affect the environment by having further sharp increases in greenhouse gas emissions.  We need to move away from polluting imported fossil fuels, which requires solutions that are based on renewal sources of energy, of which we have an abundance and for which we need to plan.  Talking about the problem will not solve it.  What we need are alternatives.  We need to open a debate and quickly move to action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1553635500,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I was one of a number of Deputies who had the great pleasure to attend the climate strike student protest outside the D&aacute;il two weeks ago.  All of us who were there could not but have been impressed by the enormous energy and enthusiasm of the young people who organised the event.  It featured some of the best placards I have ever seen at a political protest.  There were also two very clear messages from all the young people who spoke from the platform.  The first was a damning criticism of the Government and political system generally for their failure to act over decades to tackle this crisis.  The second was a demand for action and for all of us to do what is necessary to start to get our emissions under control.<\/p><p>In case the Government is fed up of listening to the Opposition, it does not have to listen to the Opposition or protesting students to understand the depth of the difficulties we are in.  A report from its own Climate Change Advisory Council last year had some pretty stinging criticisms of the Government's failure in this regard.  Under key messages, the report, in the executive summary, states: <\/p><blockquote>Ireland is completely off course in terms of achieving its 2020 and 2030 emissions reduction targets.  Without urgent action that leads to tangible and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland is unlikely to deliver on its national, EU and international obligations and will drift further from a pathway that is consistent with the transition to a low-carbon economy and society.<\/blockquote><p>It further states: &quot;Instead of achieved the required reduction of 1 million tonnes per year in carbon dioxide emissions, consistent with National Policy Position, Ireland is currently increasing its emissions at a rate of 2 million tonnes per year.&quot;  Those are not the words of Karl Marx.  This is not the work of an Opposition politician with which the Minister ideologically disagrees.  The is the work of his own group of experts which is tasked with advising him on what action to take and it is telling him clearly that he is failing.  For me, the following sentence from the report is crucial: &quot;The Government has not provided a pathway for the decarbonisation of the economy and society by 2050.&quot;  Any plan for the decarbonisation of the economy would start with a very simple premise, namely, that if we want to reduce emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, we must stop extracting them from the ground.  That is a basic and simple proposition.  For this reason, Sinn F&eacute;in is more than happy to support the legislation.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the Minister's remarks on the deliberations of the joint committee, it seems remarkable that a Bill can pass by an overwhelming majority on Second Stage in this House and somehow be frustrated in committee.  That tells us that the committee was originally constructed with a deliberately inbuilt Government majority, despite the Government not having a majority in this Chamber.<\/p><p> We support the Bill.  I think its proposers would agree it is just one element of a much bigger approach that is needed from Government.  I look forward to seeing the Government plan.  The Government has lots of other plans in areas like health and housing and fails to honour the commitments in those, or indeed to fund them.  What we need to see in the plan is ambitious, legally binding emissions reduction targets.  They need to be enshrined in law so nobody can escape them and they need to cover all sectors, such as energy, transport and agriculture.  They have to be supported by adequate investment in the first instance, as Deputy Stanley outlined, to provide people with the cleaner renewable energy alternatives that are necessary for them to be able to carry on with their lives.  This is also to ensure that, as we make that transition, it is just for the workers who will be affected by it but also fair, particularly for low and middle income families who, unfortunately, on the basis of how the Government seems to be proceeding, are set to yet again pay the burden of Government inaction.<\/p> <p> Last week, Sinn F&eacute;in launched a document which is another part of our contribution to this debate.  It is a set of proposals on how to dramatically increase energy efficiency in the residential sector both through an expanded programme of retrofitting in private and public sector rental properties, but also to raise real concerns about whether the Government is even meeting its near-zero energy building requirements.  Despite the fact there were targets for 2018 and 2020, it is not clear which Department is monitoring this.  Despite the fact I have asked the Departments responsible for both climate action and housing who is checking to see if these targets are being met, both are telling us it is not them and to look elsewhere.<\/p> <p> Obviously, many of us who are not on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment have not seen the full report and will wait to see that later.  I sat on the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which spent significant time deliberating on that issue and produced a report that the Government has singularly failed to implement.  Even as a gesture of good faith, the Government should allow this Bill to proceed.  It should stop frustrating it as it is frustrating other legislation through procedural complexities.  It should allow us to progress a simple, sensible, practical alternative that will do what all of the young people who protested outside here two weeks ago want us to do, namely, keep fossil fuels in the ground, dramatically reduce our emissions and start taking serious action on climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600051#ZZ00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553636100,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Before we proceed, I point out to the House that the motion before us is about process.

There is a very clear set of recommendations in respect of that and, in particular, a set of clear climate actions that the people want to see put into effect in respect of reducing the millions of tonnes of carbon we produce in this society on an annual basis.  What is pertinent to the debate is whether the House allows for the process whereby, when something that is either a legitimate motion or legitimate legislation comes before the House, depending on one's point of view, that is stymied by the powers that be at a given point in time.  It is our very clear view that this process is being stymied, and I make no bones about that.  Thousands of people have inundated us with emails in respect of their views and to ask and demand of us that we keep carbon and fossil fuels in the ground and do not extract them.<\/p>  <p>  On that basis, in respect of the process, the Labour Party supports the motion that comes before us tonight.  I want to quote from one of the emails I have received.  It states that the fair and reasonable approach is clear here; that this is a D&aacute;il Bill and the select committee of Deputies should be allowed to decide whether to move the Bill to the next Stage; that Senators will have their chance to vote on the Bill if it passes all Stages in the D&aacute;il and moves to the Seanad; and that the Government should not be able to block Deputies from pursuing the D&aacute;il's legislative process.

The first point I want to make on the process is to note that there is already precedent for this policy of seeking to prohibit the issue of licences for exploration for fossil fuels off coastlines.  In December 2017, France passed legislation to end new licences for oil and gas exploration and to cease all oil and gas extraction by 2040.  In that December also, the World Bank made the hugely significant decision that it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects after this year.  Costa Rica has introduced a moratorium on petroleum exploration until at least 2021 and in January of last year the Belize Government announced legislation to end offshore fossil fuel exploration due to the impact on its barrier reef.<\/p><p>The Government's countermotion notes the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption across the entire economy to make progress towards the national transition to a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally-sustainable economy by 2050.  Part of that process has to include the measures contained in the Bill.  Recent research indicates that policies targeting fossil fuel supply are an important complement to measures aimed at reducing demand.  While an immediate ban on fossil fuel use is not being advocated in this Bill, it is clear that the phasing out of fossil fuels and the increase in the use of renewables must be radically speeded up.  The EPA has stated that we need a stronger incentive to move away from fossil fuel use and that fossil fuel investments carry major financial risks.  It urges that investment be directed away from fossil fuels towards sustainable, low-carbon alternatives.  That is why this Bill must progress to the next Stage.  It must move on to Committee Stage where amendments can be tabled and robust discussions can be had.<\/p> <p> As currently drafted, the Bill can be interpreted as not removing the option of indigenous reserves exploration until existing licences expire.  As far as I can tell, opposition to this Bill by industry, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Government is based on the hope of retaining the option of continued exploration and the opening up of new fields beyond existing licences.  Industry and the Government claim that the Bill will not reduce Ireland's emissions but it is clear that the enactment of this legislation will promote the transition to a decarbonised economy.  Ireland is completely behind in achieving its climate and energy obligations.  We are known internationally as a climate laggard.  <\/p> <p> A full 71% of global emissions are the responsibility of just 100 companies.  That is why we need to address the issues raised in this Bill.  This legislation is supported by many groups including Stop Climate Chaos, the Environmental Pillar and Tr&oacute;caire, not to mention the thousands of young people who were out on the streets protesting two weeks ago.  As Deputy Pringle said, if the voting age was reduced to 16, this Government would not be re-elected because all of the 16 year olds out there would take on the Government and hold it to account for not progressing this legislation.<\/p> <p> On the question of process, this Government has continuously tried to thwart Bills from the Opposition.  We have seen it with the money message delays and the activity on this legislation that we have seen this evening.   We have also seen it with regard to a Bill I submitted in 2016, namely, the Thirty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) Bill.  Last year the Minister asked for three months to come back to the House with an amendment.  We are still waiting for that amendment to come back from the Attorney General, even though we have raised it time and again.  The Government has been kicking that particular can down the road for two years at this stage.  It uses every means available to push back and kick the can down the road on Bills that could actually make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600052#AAA03000","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553636700,"counter":628,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l ach dh&aacute; n&oacute;im&eacute;ad go leith agam.

I do not know how he could stand over the speech he read out in view of the seriousness of what we are discussing.  In view of the ruling made by the Ceann Comhairle, I will stick to the issue of the process.  The motion asserts that the pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill has been discharged and that it is time to move on to Committee Stage.  I agree with that because of the seriousness of the issue but the Government seems to have missed the message entirely.  We have had the Tion&oacute;l Saoranach telling us to take action, pointing us in the right direction and giving us clear recommendations.  We have had students on our streets.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, as referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has told us that our reputation as a climate laggard is likely to discourage foreign direct investment.  I think that may be language that the Government understands.  Our climate inaction will discourage foreign direct investment.  Indeed, the IDA has warned that more and more companies are asking about our policy on fossil fuel divestment.  <\/p>  <p>  We have taken some measures in the D&aacute;il, by way of new politics, of which I am very proud, particularly Deputy Pringle's Bill which recently became law.  I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith for persisting with this legislation.  I do not know how we can look in the eye of the children of this country who are appealing to us to take action because they will live with the consequences.  Not only will the children of this country live with the consequences, it is those in the poorer countries of the world who contribute least to climate change who will bear the brunt of it, as we saw recently in Mozambique in Africa.  We have talked of legislation and time but now we must take action.  The Government likes to quote the former President, Ms Mary Robinson, on occasion but it does not really listen to her.  She is telling us that we have to get to zero emissions by 2050 in order to stay below 2&deg;C of warming.  That means that we must leave two thirds or more of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a deliberate misinterpretation of what is proposed in the motion and the Bill.  I suggest that the Minister of State's speechwriters read the motion and the Bill.  I also urge them to read what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Professor Sweeney, Tr&oacute;caire and others have said, if they think that the Deputies proposing and supporting this are too far to the left.

We simply cannot get away from this debate.  Climate change is one of those issues that deeply divides opinion, not only in terms of its causes but also in terms of proposed solutions.  Indeed, even among the small group of rural Independents, we are divided.  While I agree that we must certainly work to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and increase our use of sustainable and effective renewable energy, I do not agree that we should impose an outright ban on fossil fuels, which is what the Bill seeks to do.  It seeks to stop the issuing of State licences for further fossil fuel exploration in this country.  What we need to do is establish a sustainable environmental agenda which can meet the needs of those in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to also meet their needs.  In that context, I welcome the young people in the Gallery tonight.  While the Bill is well-meaning, it is far too restrictive and takes no account of issues such as energy security.

I come from a community where there is little or no planning regulation in respect of solar farms or wind turbines.  Planning permission had been sought for many solar farms in Bandon, Kinsale and other places in west Cork and there has been no planning regulation whatsoever.  This is awful for people who will now have to have solar farms outside homes and properties for which they may have paid a great deal of money.  It is the same situation with wind turbines.

This is the key question that has delayed the progression of the Bill.  There have been significant policy developments on the part of the Government in this area since the D&aacute;il dealt with the issue 13 months ago.  Project Ireland 2040 commits us to the removal of dirty fossil fuels - coal, oil and peat - from electricity generation by 2027; their removal from our heating systems by 2035; and cars that use fossil fuels are to be taken off our roads by 2045.  Our dependence on oil is set to decrease significantly over the next 15 years, which is the likely timeline for landing any oil found in the deep waters off our Atlantic coast.<\/p>  <p>  In the past 40 years, we have had just four commercial gas finds.  Basing future energy security on the possibility of an oil find is like playing roulette and living in hope.  Contrast that with the renewable electricity potential off our coast, which, at 50 GW, is enough to meet the daily electricity demands of France and Austria combined.  If we established an offshore renewable development authority, we could auction off this electricity.  Crucially, this energy is owned by the Irish people and the money it would generate could be used to reduce the cost of clean electricity to families across the State.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things Ireland is good at is producing food.  As we develop our green image in key food markets around the globe in the coming decade it will be very difficult to justify Ireland's continued facilitation of oil exploration, especially when it is becoming the global leader in offshore renewable electricity production.  The Government of the day could be put in the dreadful position where it might have to buy back the rights to these oil reserves that it is currently awarding.   We need to press the pause button now and not wait for new laws to be introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600054#CCC01000","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1553637300,"counter":641,"content":"<p>That is why they got rid of the Deputy from his position as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600054#CCC01100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1553637300,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I regret that I was not in the Chamber to hear the earlier part of the debate.  A very important meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action took place earlier.  This important motion before the House is, as the Ceann Comhairle noted, about process.  It is about the powers of this Parliament.  In the United Kingdom, we can see how the House of Commons is taking back power from Government.  This is a similar moment.  The Government has been fighting the Bill in the knowledge that it does not have the ability to refuse to issue a money message to block it.  We will pass the motion when we vote on it on Thursday and thereby allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  That would be an historic moment for the environmental movement in the State and for this Parliament.  It is important that we do not allow the Government and the various Departments involved to block the majority will of the people as represented in this House.<\/p>  <p>  This is a hugely significant Bill.  I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and People Before Profit for bringing it forward.  One of the key actions advocated by the environmental movement to tackle the problem of climate change at source is to not put all the guilt, onus and pressure on individuals to change their behaviour.  We should make it easier for people to change their behaviour and we will have to make massive investments and policy decisions to allow that to happen.  We also need to recognise the science and listen to what Greta Thunberg and the IPCC are saying.   We are aware that we have to leave four fifths of known fossil fuel reserves underground.  This is what the Bill will do for Ireland's part of the world.  Our sea area is ten times the size of our land area.  This is not a small decision; it is not of minor consequence.  It is huge in the context of what it would do to keep those fossil fuel reserves in the ground and in the signal it would send out to the rest of the world that Ireland can and will be good at this transition.<\/p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy Healy-Rae and the others, I am of the view that the alternative future in which we will electrify our transport and the heating in our homes, along with all of the other measures we are going to take, will see Irish people thrive and will bring back a strong sense of community with a completely different economic model.  We cannot do that and at the same time say we are going in the direction of still looking for every last trace of gas and every last drop of oil.  We have to stop.  We have to start making the switch.  This would give a very important signal to the business community, to our own people and to the international community that Ireland is truly going green.<\/p>  <p>  I have been sitting here with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith through this process and it has been disgraceful the way the Bill has been blocked.  The way that Standing Orders and other processes have been used, and the way the Government has blocked the Bill, has been disrespectful of the Parliament.  This has come to an end here tonight and I very much welcome that.  It is very important that we proceed immediately to Committee Stage and on to Report Stage in order that the Bill can be put before the Seanad during the remaining days of this D&aacute;il and then enacted.  This would be a hugely significant step.  I would love to see it happen with a range of other Bills also, but we will start here tonight.  This is an historic moment and I commend Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on the way she presented the Bill and in how she stuck with it against all of the obstacles that were put in her way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600054#CCC01200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1553637300,"counter":643,"content":"<p>With all due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who spoke earlier, a senior Minister is not here to address this issue.

The other side of that coin is the lack of respect for the process of democracy in the House and for the process by which legislation moves through the Oireachtas.

It affects many Bills, in particular Private Members' Bills, which find themselves in the same black hole.  Democracy is being frustrated by the Government.  It is frustrating the will of this Parliament and, ultimately, the will of the people.  It is clear that there is great interest in the Bill nationally.  Like me, most Deputies will have received numerous emails about the Bill from constituents over the past ten days.  They have asked us to support the Bill and made the valid point, to quote one email, that the fair and reasonable approach is that, as this is a D&aacute;il Bill, a select committee of Deputies should be allowed to decide to move it to Committee Stage.  The email notes that Senators will have their own chance to vote on the Bill if it passes all Stages in the D&aacute;il and moves to the Seanad.  The email says the Government should not be able to block Deputies from pursuing the D&aacute;il's legislative process.  This is a widely held view outside the House as well as inside it.  This is a very important, practical and necessary Bill and the Government must stop frustrating its progress by means of various methods before the committee.

We are discussing a very important environmental Bill and the process surrounding it but the Minister is not here.  The senior Ministers of the Government are not here.  Do they understand the growing sentiment among people on the issue?  Do they understand the powerful sentiment growing among the young generation on this issue?  The Government has tried to round up its Senators to block the Bill and to block the D&aacute;il from debating it, notwithstanding the fact that those Senators will have an opportunity to discuss it in the Seanad.  They are trying to use the rules and the process against the spirit of the situation which demands a proper debate on these crucial issues.  I support the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 and the banning of exploration for fossil fuels.  Ireland should become the fourth country in the world to take that step.<\/p>  <p>  To see why it is wrong to use the process to block the Bill, one need only look at what has been happening in Mozambique in recent times.  The United Nations describes what has been happening there as the single worst weather disaster in the history of the southern hemisphere.  The country's former education Minister, Gra&ccedil;a Machel, says the destruction of the city of Beira will go down in history as the first time a city was completely devastated by climate change.  There are things we can do.  We can pass the Bill and take other measures.  Recently, bus fares were cut in the city of Cork for a period of six weeks from &euro;2.40 to &euro;1 as a concession to the local traders' lobby which said trade had been cut as a result of partial pedestrianisation and a car ban on the city's main street, Patrick Street.  While it was a modest measure and extremely limited in time, we are getting reports that public transport use increased by 8% while it was in place.  Further, the increased level of use has largely held since the measure was reversed and the fare was put back up to &euro;2.40.  It raises the question of what would happen if public transport were made completely free, not just for six weeks but indefinitely.  What if we followed the example of Estonia, Luxembourg and 100 other cities around the world?  We would see a major increase in the use of public transport which is precisely the alternative to the car that we need.  Free public transport would cost the State &euro;600 million per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600055#DDD00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1553637900,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy follow his own motion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600055#DDD00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553637900,"counter":647,"content":"<p>We will come back to process in a second.

Globally, 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of greenhouse gas emissions.  It is the profiteers who are the polluters and the key polluters are the profiteers.  This shows that the fight to defend the environment and protect the climate is linked with the struggle against the profiteers and the capitalist system itself.  The main threat to the environment and the planet comes from capitalism.  It comes from big business interests putting profit first and the oil and gas industry is at the forefront.  Less than two weeks ago, 1.4 million young people in 125 countries around the world went on the streets to demand action.  They said we need system change not climate change.  That slogan is the beginning of an anti-capitalist consciousness or view point among many of those young people.  The climate crisis is set to get worse before it might get better but it will not get better if governments protecting big business and vested interests continue to block Bills like this by using process and block progressive policies such as the implementation of free public transport.  I warn the Government that if it continues to protect big business and vested interests, as I think it will, and the situation goes from bad to worse, not only will it have greater numbers of young people on the streets in the months and years to come, there will be a greater and growing awareness among them that the root of the problem is the capitalist system protected by governments like this one.<\/p><p>They will make a reality of the idea of having system change, not climate change, and challenge and change the system to replace it with something better and more democratic, a democratic socialist society where the wealth is used for the benefit of people and the environment, not profiteers and polluters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600055#DDD00400","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553638500,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We have heard a range of views on the clear need for action on climate change.  Much of it chimes with the recent messages from our young students and their demands for action from us.  Regardless of one's position on this Bill, we are moving in the right direction by spending more of our time discussing these matters.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, stated, while we may not all agree on the exact details of the path, we are agreed on the destination.  The Government is aware that more must be done urgently and I am working closely with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to ensure that happens.  The Minister has been clear about the Government's ambition to make Ireland a leader, not a follower, in responding to climate change.  This will require a significant step change across government.  Put simply, it requires increased action.  New initiatives are needed across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors, building on the previous actions taken by the Government, including in the national mitigation plan and the national development plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, outlined examples of measures that have been taken.  They are but a sample of what we must pursue.  As a rural Deputy with a farming background, I am acutely aware that there must be credible and meaningful actions across the board.  The work of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAl, and some of the measures it has been rolling out are great examples of steps than can be taken.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment funds a number of its schemes that aim to improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses across the country.  Examples include a range of grants that are available to householders for improvements such as insulation and heat pumps.  Over the last year, the measures available under these grants have been expanded to include deeper measures and to support the policy decision to transition from grant aid for fossil fuel heating systems.  Other measures are in place for people on lower incomes and for community-based partnership, such as the better energy communities scheme.  The SEAI is also seeking to put schemes in place to drive energy efficiency on farms.  I highlight these to show that reducing our emissions will require the continued roll-out of a range of tailored and well designed measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600056#EEE00200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1553638500,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Are you going to talk to us about the motion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600056#EEE00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553638500,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I will, but I have listened to a great deal tonight and there was very little about the motion so I must reply to everything that was said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600056#EEE00400","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1553638500,"counter":652,"content":"<p>If you feel you must, but it would be preferable if you would stick to the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600056#EEE00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553638500,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Such measures will have to be funded.  This issue is being considered by the climate committee and I look forward to seeing its recommendations.  As the Taoiseach has said, a carbon tax should not be about raising money for the Government or punishing people in their pockets.  It should be about nudging people and businesses to change behaviour and adopt new technologies.  We must also work with our farmers to modernise agriculture and reduce emissions from that sector, taking into account the need to protect their incomes and livelihoods as well as the environment.<\/p>  <p>  The tax regime in respect of oil and gas has the prospect of delivering considerable revenue to the State.  Most of the exploration licences that have been awarded in the Irish offshore are on the most recent tax terms, which means a rate of tax of between 25% and 55% depending on the profitability of the field.  The assertion that we are seeking to tax the people and not the companies does not hold up to scrutiny.  I also caution against a rush to make the climate debate a debate about tax alone.  Such an approach will be divisive and we should guard against it.<\/p>  <p>  Some Members have strong feelings about this Bill.  I would like to be in a position to state that Ireland no longer needs oil and gas but that is simply not the case.  That is the fundamental problem we must address.  Hence the counter motion the Government has proposed which: notes the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption across the economy; recognises that there is a need to step up Ireland's progress and ambition in this area; looks forward to all parties supporting the special committee's report and its conclusions and recommendations; and specifically calls on the Government to urgently bring forward an all-of-Government plan which will set out the actions that must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change and providing for a significant increase over the next decade in the level of renewable energy in our energy mix.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the Bill, I reiterate that all the rules have been followed correctly.  This has been checked and confirmed.  There is no more I can say on that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, set out our fundamental issues with the Bill.  The Bill would have no impact on emissions.  It would guarantee that we source the fossil fuels we need during the transition to a low carbon economy not from Irish waters, but from outside the EU, for example, from Russia or the Persian Gulf.  Furthermore, importing our energy over long distances from third countries can have the perverse effect of increasing emissions, as energy is consumed in delivering it to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There are no quick fixes when it comes to climate action.  This Government is committed to moving away from the use of fossil fuels in electricity, heat and transport.  I ask people watching this debate and who are invested in Ireland taking action on climate change not to conclude that by not supporting this Bill we are not intending to ramp up our actions.  We did so earlier this week with the announcement of delivering 70% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  Unlike the Bill before us, this will deliver a real and tangible reduction in our emissions.  We will soon finalise our all-of-Government action plan to reduce our carbon emissions.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a threat to our energy supply, as has been stated by a number of Members.  It could also expose the Exchequer to a loss of income if implemented.  I ask Deputies to support us in delivering the actions we are taking.

They included the Chairman of the climate committee, Ministers, Opposition spokespersons and so forth.  I am glad to say that some of them have not capitulated.

Instead, it used the dark cavernous committee rooms where it has a majority.

We are trying to worm our way out of our climate commitments, which we have catastrophically failed to meet.  This will cost this country billions of euro in fines, not to mention the environmental disaster that will be visited on us.  It is shameful.

The contrast between what is supposed to be the embodiment of democracy in this country - the place people like Connolly and Pearse fought and died for - and the Government's devious attempts to sabotage this Bill and the energy, dynamism, commitment and concern for the future of our young people could not be sharper.  God almighty, if it is left up to this Government, we are doomed.  Thankfully, it is not left up to this Government.  The future was out on the streets over the last few weeks.

If we made a find, which would be rare, it would not pay back in spades to the State.  I had to listen to a Senator who showed up to vote against this Bill waffle about how great it would be if we found our own gas and oil, that it would be cheaper than importing gas or oil.  He had not even bothered to show up when the committee was scrutinising the Bill and hearing evidence from experts who were able to tell us that in the event of any find, there would be no bonanza or royalties for the Irish taxpayer and no massive tax take from these oil or gas companies.  Also, if there is a find it would be sold back to the State at market value.  There is nothing in this for the Irish people.  Most of all, it is ridiculous to say that there is no energy security if we stop issuing licences to extract fuel.  There is no security on this planet if we hurtle to a temperature rise of 1.5oC or 2oC.  There is no security for anybody anywhere.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Lawless was correct in his remarks about new politics.  He was also correct that the Government is hugging this Bill and keeping it hostage.  The Government usurped Standing Orders to ensure its supporters on the joint committee put a stop to a report being laid before the D&aacute;il on a D&aacute;il Bill.  The joint committee has no legal or democratic right to stop a D&aacute;il Bill proceeding to committee.  Otherwise, we are flying in the face of the spirit of this Oireachtas and these Houses for which people fought for years.  There must be democracy.  I have no problem with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, disagreeing with me about energy security, emissions or anything else.  In fact, I look forward to the day when he and I can debate these issues in committee, when he can put forward amendments in a legitimate space where we should be having this discussion and where anybody else in this House can put forward amendments if he or she thinks this Bill does not go far enough or it is too weak and so on.  We need to be in committee having that debate.  That committee then needs to process the outcome of that debate through to the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  The objective of this Private Members' motion is to allow that to happen.  It is mean-spirited of the Government to force us to use our Private Members' time in this way when it could have been used to deal with issues of workers' rights, women's rights, the crisis in the housing sector or the health emergencies throughout this country.  We have used our Private Members' time.  I urge the Government to withdraw its amendment, which is silly.  It has nothing to do with what is before the House tonight.  The Government needs to allow democracy to take place and allow this Bill to move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600057#FFF00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1553639100,"counter":659,"content":"<p>On the point made by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, which I also made in my contribution, is the Government's amendment not out of order?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600057#FFF00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1553639100,"counter":660,"content":"<p>It is not out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600057#FFF00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553639100,"counter":661,"content":"<p>It does not in any way deal with the content of the motion, which the Ceann Comhairle also alluded to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600057#FFF00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1553639100,"counter":662,"content":"<p>We will deal with it in a second.
