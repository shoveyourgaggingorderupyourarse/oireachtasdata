Such stakeholders include the current chair of a relevant State board concerned and the Public Appointments Service itself.  Ministers will be expected to provide\u00a0the Public Appointments Service\u00a0with the key requirements that a candidate must meet, including specialist skills\u00a0and technical knowledge;\u00a0relevant experience\u00a0and sectoral expertise; educational and other qualifications, and particular personal attributes.

As the consent authority for flood alleviation schemes under section 7 of the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 to 1995, the regulations require my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to carry out an environmental impact assessment of drainage or flood relief schemes prior to confirmation or approval of the proposed schemes, publicise his decision to confirm or refuse to confirm a proposed drainage scheme, inform the Commissioners and the public of the decision, provide for a process for appeal or review of the decision, and inform the public of this process.<\/p><p>  The Clare river or Claregalway drainage scheme was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for ministerial confirmation on 2 November 2013.  In accordance with normal procedure, the scheme documentation submitted to the Department included an environmental impact statement, which is a consultant's report of the environmental impacts of the works and the OPW's proposals to mitigate these impacts as far as possible.  The Claregalway scheme is the first flood relief scheme submitted for confirmation following the coming into effect of the 2012 regulations and, understandably, the Department needed to consider fully the implications for the confirmation process of the new regulations.  Consultations took place with the Attorney General's office to get clarification on how the new regulations should be interpreted and implemented in the context of the confirmation process for drainage schemes.  Based on advice received from the Attorney General's office, the Department is in the process of engaging experts to carry out an independent review as part of the assessment of the environmental impact statement of the Claregalway scheme submitted by the OPW.  The tender process is nearing completion and the Department expects to be in a position to place a contract shortly.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne will understand that the scheme can only be confirmed pending the outcome of the expert's review and the conclusion of the required public notification process.

I covered some of the other areas.<\/p><p>  The Bill I produced in 2012 covered some of the shortcomings experienced by a number of Irish families who had loved ones die abroad.  Currently, the law does not permit the registration of such deaths abroad.  I am glad to note this is being taken care of and that the obstacles which impeded the introduction of these important measures have been overcome, enabling the Ministers to proceed.  It has been quite a while coming and I am delighted to see progress.  As I alluded to, there was a &quot;Help bring them home&quot; campaign from Galway which was led by my colleague, Councillor Padraig Conneely, who led a delegation before the Joint Committee on Social Protection on this issue.<\/p><p>  It is important the legal obstacles which impeded the introduction of these important measures have been overcome enabling the Ministers to proceed with this comprehensive Bill.  Section 13 amends Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and creates a new register of Irish deaths abroad through section 44B.  Section 44C sets out the information an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir will require to register the death, while section 44D empowers an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir or an agent acting on behalf of his or her office to provide families, and even parents, siblings and partners, with the certificate reflecting the entry of the death on the Irish record of deaths abroad.  Crucially, the Bill is retrospective in this regard.  Families of Irish persons who have died abroad in the recent or distant past will be able to apply to have the death recorded on the new register of Irish deaths abroad and obtain an equivalent to an Irish death certificate.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister and the Department officials for their work on this area.  It is an emotive issue for families who have suffered a bereavement abroad.  Many parents and siblings of family members who have died abroad have been in contact with me stating that, for closure for them and their families, they want an Irish death certificate.<\/p><p>I am pleased the process is going through the D&aacute;il and they will soon be able to receive the death certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900011#J01900","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412848500,"counter":153,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As the previous speaker said, the Bill is one we have been anxious to see come to the House for some time.  I have raised the issue on numerous occasions on the Order of Business and with the line Minister, in order to expedite the arrival of the Bill in the House, which I particularly welcome.<\/p><p>  When I look back on my three and a half years as a national parliamentarian, without doubt one of my proudest achievements in that time is the contribution I made to the children&rsquo;s referendum.  The reason I say that in the context of this Bill is because the children&rsquo;s referendum represented a huge milestone in terms of the change for a tiny minority of the population, namely, children in State care, relative to the number of children in care.  Such children are very vulnerable and it is very important to take care of them.  As a representative, if one finds it within one&rsquo;s gift to do something to improve the lot of a tiny percentage of people then one&rsquo;s time in the House will be made all the more worthwhile.<\/p><p>  Likewise, I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the Bill today and to ensure its passage through the House.  In the overall scheme of things a small number will be affected by it but it is none-the-less important.  I speak in particular of the element of the Bill that relates to the registration of deaths abroad.  The trauma, hurt and grief remains with the family, as is evident when one meets people who have lost a son or daughter.  I think in particular of Colm Johnson from Bandon in west Cork, a 24-year old young man with his life ahead of him, who was killed tragically on 6 August 2012 while on a kayaking holiday.  To add to the grief and trauma I can only imagine his Dad, Moss, his Mum, Ann, and his siblings are going through, is the fact that the State refused to recognise not alone their grief and trauma but that the death had occurred.  They explained the hurt it caused to them.  I speak for the many parents who have lost loved ones abroad.  To lose a loved one in any circumstances is extraordinarily traumatic, but to lose somebody abroad brings added trauma, hurt and difficulty.  As a State, we further compound the situation by hindering the resolution of issues that must be resolved, including the paperwork that must be done due to the State failing to recognise the death.  I heartily welcome this long overdue development.<\/p><p>  Ireland has changed and it continues to change.  For young people the world has become a smaller place in the past 20 years.  They travel to far-flung destinations for short periods, whether on an adventure, short work placement or holiday.  That is the world we live in.  It is time the State recognised that fact and put an end to any further injurious hurt we might cause to families by refusing to recognise officially the death of a loved one.  The measure is to be welcomed.  It cannot come soon enough.<\/p><p>  The other aspects of the Bill mirror changes in society.  I welcome in particular the registration of the father&rsquo;s details on birth certificates.  In a typical family it is not an issue but in an atypical one it can be a big issue for a person who wants to know his or her identity.  The State cannot provide such details yet a person sitting beside one on the bus has all such details to hand.  That is an injustice which must be corrected.  We must be able to provide people with the information they seek and to tell them who they are.<\/p><p>  Another element of the Bill relates to marriages of convenience.  It is important for the State to be able to step in where a genuine and sincere conviction is held that a marriage is being undertaken where advantage is being taken of someone for immigration-related benefits.

The first relates to the concept of a marriage of convenience, which my colleague, Deputy Jim Daly, mentioned.<\/p><p>  A marriage of convenience means a marriage where at least one of the parties to the marriage, at the time of entry into the marriage, is a foreign national and enters into the marriage solely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage for at least one of the parties to the marriage.  I have at least one if not two friends whom I suspect have entered into marriages of convenience, at least based on the definition I outlined.  In one case the bride was a foreign national who came to Ireland with her parents from North America.  She lived practically all of her life in Ireland, as she came at the age of five and she lived in a small rural village, met her boyfriend in her teens and they lived together for a number of years.  To all intents and purposes Ireland was her only home.  However, she had not been registered properly and eventually her immigration status caught up with her.  That said, there was no doubt that to all intents and purposes she was Irish and Ireland was her home.  She was involved in a loving relationship.  The couple lived together and they seemed to me to be quite happy, but who knows who is happy and who is not.  From the outside it looked like a loving relationship.  Perhaps it was but who knows.  What is love?  Is love a prerequisite to be in a relationship?<\/p><p>  The easiest thing for them to do in order to solve her immigration status was to marry.  They could have opted to make representations to Ministers and gone through the horrible immigration system we have in this country which seems to be never-ending.  Most of the legal advice she got was that there was no doubt she would not be deported, and that Ireland is her home but she would probably spend a lot of money and that it would take about five or six years to sort out the mess.  They said she could expect letters from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and that she would have to travel to Dublin frequently.  In effect, her time would be wasted and she would probably not be allowed to work even though she went to school in Ireland and lived here practically all her life.  She was told that the easiest thing to do would be to get married.  The couple got married and are still married, happily, I hope.  It would seem that is the case.  They have two children.  One could ask whether that is a sign of a loving marriage; that the children are a result of love.  I did not ask them.  To all intents and purposes they are living a normal life.  They are happy citizens with two children going to the local school &ndash; close to the requisite standard of 2.4 children.<\/p><p>  I believe they would have the same life if her immigration status was not an issue; they would still have two children and be happily living together but they probably would not be married.  The reason they married was to obtain an immigration advantage and to avoid the nonsense that is the Irish immigration system, which lasts forever and in which one gets tied up.  There is a long list of judicial reviews to go through and Garda officers increasingly say what one cannot do when people go to register rather than what one can do.  I appreciate the intention of the legislation is to capture people who have never met before but one could ask whether even that is unusual.  One could talk about customs in certain countries and the payment of dowries.  Does one then get into cultural subjectivities?  Does one discriminate between cultures that have a dowry system and one that does not?  It is a very difficult concept to legislate for.  I wonder whether the Bill contains the right wording or if there is a better wording.  Unfortunately, I am not certain there is.<\/p><p>  It is not unusual for immigration status to be among the considerations involved in a decision as to whether people would marry.<\/p><p>If a couple is involved in a stable relationship, albeit involving an Irish national abroad, the other partner might want to come back to Ireland.  People often marry knowing that it will enable a partner to move more easily.<br\/><br\/>There is the idea that the immigration status of a person may be taken into account, especially if a deportation order issues in respect of a married person.  The insurmountable obstacles test used to be applied to cases where one spouse is Irish and has always lived here and the other is not an Irish citizen, although he or she may have lived here for most of his or her life.  The latter may be a citizen of Liberia or any country outside western Europe and North America and an immigration official may suggest that there is no insurmountable obstacle to the couple living in the country of the non-Irish citizen.  This suggestion will be made notwithstanding that one of them has never been in that country before and the other may not have been there since he or she was a toddler.  If such people meet in a nightclub like any other couple, is it a marriage of convenience?  It probably is.  The couple are together not because of immigration status but because they want to live their lives together, like most couples.  The reason for the marriage, however, is immigration status.<br\/><br\/>Another issue is impediments to marriage.  This is an amendment to the Civil Registration Act 2004, which was the first legislation to note that being of the same sex is an impediment to marriage.  The Government tells us there will be a referendum on this but I question the need for that.  Can we not simply legislate for the issue?  It will be a divisive and hurtful campaign for many people and it may not be necessary to engage the public in a referendum.  After all, we Members of the Oireachtas are paid to be here and the Constitution says we are legislators, although Departments are the de facto legislators and we merely apply the rubber stamp.  Do we need a referendum?  I am led to believe a former Attorney General said a referendum is required on this in an opinion supplied to the Government.  I have not seen this opinion nor has anyone else because no one sees the opinions of Attorneys General.  Can an exception be made in this case?  Is there a reason such opinions are not made available?  Should such opinions be made available as a matter of course?  If it is a matter where the State is being sued and there is a potential liability to the State, the Government will not wish to show its hand by publishing an opinion.  Surely, however, opinions relating to matters of public importance that require the time and expense of a referendum could be published.  Very few people want a referendum on this issue if it can be legislated for.  That is certainly the case for most of the gay people who want to marry and to whom I have spoken.  Why is it not possible to legislate for this?<br\/><br\/>I am aware of cases relating to this topic such as Murray <i>v. <\/i>Ireland and a high-profile one involving Senator Zappone.  In Murray <i>v. <\/i>Ireland Mr. Justice Costello of the High Court and once of this House said the Constitution makes clear that the concept and nature of marriage, which it enshrines, are derived from the Christian notion of partnership based on irrevocable personal consent.  It is clear, then, that the judgments refer to the Christian notion of marriage in the Constitution and on this basis the court found it was acceptable for Ireland to refuse to recognise same-sex marriages from abroad.  There is a world of difference, however, between saying it is acceptable for the Oireachtas not to recognise same-sex marriages and saying it would be unlawful for the Oireachtas to legislate to recognise same-sex marriages or allow same-sex marriage in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>It is clear the notion of marriage in the Constitution is based on a Christian notion of marriage, but that does not mean civil marriages are unlawful in Ireland.  Even divorce is lawful in Ireland since the constitutional referendum on that issue.  Our notions of what provisions of the Constitution mean constantly evolve.  Many people accept that gay marriage is part of the right to have a family, that the security of family life should apply to heterosexual and homosexual people equally.  I question the need for a referendum on this issue if it is possible to legislate for it.<br\/><br\/>Hard cases make bad law and section 46 of the 2004 Act reads &quot;a marriage solemnised in the State, after the commencement of this section, between persons of any age shall not be valid in law unless the persons concerned&quot; notify a registrar in writing three months prior to the date of the marriage or are granted an exemption from doing so by a court.  I imagine the latter would apply if there was a rush to marry.  Before this provision was enacted, any marriage carried out in a Catholic church where there were two witnesses was valid in the eyes of the State.  The situation was slightly more complex for marriages carried out in other Christian churches and under other faiths, such as the Jewish faith, but they were still valid.  What happens now if the people involved do not seek permission in advance and a priest proceeds to marry them anyway?  It will be a valid Catholic marriage under Canon Law but it is not a marriage in the eyes of the State.  Some might say this is not a problem - the couple can marry again in a civil ceremony - but what happens if such an arrangement only emerges after one of the parties has died?  Some people marry for immigration status but some do so because death is impending and they wish marry before it occurs for various reasons, including legal and insurance reasons.  What happens in these circumstances where there was no impediment to marriage and there was an intention to marry validly?  Could such a marriage be recognised as valid in the eyes of the State after the fact?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900012#K01000","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412849100,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Clare Daly.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this new legislation, the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014.  This is an important debate as many complex issues are covered in the Bill.  We must get this right, respect the rights of the person and ensure there is no question of exploitation.  We must be vigilant when it comes to trafficking and I will deal with that issue later.  Our minds must be clear and open and prejudice must be tackled in order that all Irish and European Union citizens are treated equally.  There is no point talking about an inclusive society or building a new Ireland that respects all cultures and traditions if we do not have quality, well-planned legislation to defend the rights of citizens.  This Bill proposes many major changes to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Many relevant issues were covered earlier by my colleagues.<\/p><p>  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014 will introduce a number of changes to the Civil Registration Act 2004.<\/p><p>The Bill specifically focuses on marriage and civil partnerships of convenience, and this must be scrutinised very carefully; compulsory registration of both parents on a birth certificate, which I welcome; the validation of embassy marriages and civil partnerships, which is an important aspect of the legislation; registration of certain Irish deaths abroad; and information sharing.  These are the key elements of the legislation.<\/p><p> People may enter a marriage or civil partnership for a variety of reasons.  Love is one reason, as we all know very well.  Marriages and civil partnerships entered into for material gain or tax breaks are as equally valid in the eyes of the law as those entered into for love or a shared future.  Many people do not know this.<\/p><p> The right to marry is recognised as a fundamental human right by Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  Marriage is also afforded special protection in the Constitution in Article 41.3.1&deg; which states, &quot;The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack&quot;.<\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission's, LRC, recommendations were informed by two major principles, that the rights and best interest of the child be the primary consideration and that there should be equality between all parents who should be treated equally in respect of their relationship with their children regardless of gender or marital status.  These recommendations are top class.  The LRC cites the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as ratified.  Article 7.1 of the Convention states, &quot;The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents&quot;.  This is regularly breached in the broader debate.  One often hears the phrase &quot;non-national&quot;.  Nobody on the planet is a non-national.  People who come to Ireland might be foreign nationals, but we regularly hear the phrase &quot;non-national&quot; used in the D&aacute;il and on media programmes.  Everybody comes from somewhere, everybody has roots somewhere and everybody has a nationality.  If people want to change their nationality or amend their situation, this is their constitutional right.  People should remind themselves of Article 7.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The LRC also recommended compulsory joint registration of births and set out the necessary changes to procedures to support this move.  This is an important part of the debate.<\/p><p> A number of my colleagues have raised the issue of civil partnerships, which were introduced in 2011 and take place between two members of the same sex.  Civil partnership status is not protected in an equivalent way to marriage and we must face up to this.  I was interested to hear some of the comments of my colleague, Deputy Michael McNamara, on same-sex marriage.  As far as I am concerned, one either believes in equality or one does not.  If people of the same sex want to get married, they should be entitled to do so.  I disagree with Deputy McNamara's view that the referendum will be very divisive.  If people have a problem with equality, that is their problem.  Most Irish people have a very sensible, balanced and measured outlook on life.  All of us have friends, family members and neighbours who are gay and it is not a major issue; they are our friends, neighbours and cousins - end of story.  Do they have a right to marry?  The answer is, &quot;Absolutely, yes&quot;.  If people have prejudice and attitudes, that is their problem.  We are trying to build a new democratic inclusive Ireland based on equality and if people have problems with this broader debate, it is their problem.  We should not back off or hide from them, or say it will upset some section of society.  One either believes in equality or one does not.  I do not believe it will be a very divisive campaign.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy McNamara in that I would also love if we could just get on with it and legislate and stop having all of these referendums.  People are elected and if the electorate does not like the decisions we make, it should boot us out at the next election.  We should be able to legislate rather than having all of these referendums every second week.  We should also legislate on the Y case and all of the other social issue cases.  We have been elected to come in here and legislate.  If Members have the bottle, they should get on with it and if they do not, they should not be involved in politics.  People seem to run away from certain issues.<\/p><p> People also seem to want to back off from race equality issues.  This touches on marriages of convenience and immigration.  Racism and any type of sectarianism should be a no-no.  There should be no debate about it.  Racism should not be tolerated and nor should inequality.  People who have problems with immigration should wake up and get real.  Their own children, neighbours and cousins are running around New York or Australia as I speak.  This is part of life and immigration is part of modern life.  It is important to say this.  Anyone who has problems with &quot;these people&quot; coming into our country should get a life and get real.  There should be no question of tolerating any racism.<\/p><p> Marriages of convenience are sometimes referred to as sham marriages and generally take place so one partner can gain residency in a country.  Governments should stay out of people's bedrooms and people's personal lives.  People may not be married but may be in a long-term relationship and have children.  It is not the business of the Department of Justice and Equality or of politicians.  If people living in a country want to become a resident, they should not have to get involved in marriages or be forced down this road.<\/p><p> I welcome the provisions in the legislation on information.  It is very important to have quality information, particularly when dealing with children and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900013#L00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412849700,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I never thought I would say this, but I found some of the comments made by Deputy McNamara to be very interesting.  I was a little afraid he was going to burst into a version of \"What's Love Got To Do With It?\".  In fact, he raised some very interesting arguments which get to the heart of this matter.  What is a marriage of convenience?  What is a legal marriage?  Is there such a thing as a legitimate marriage?  People have many different reasons for marrying and who are we to say any of them is less valid than anybody else's?  I am aware of a married couple from different countries who met over the Internet.  People on the outside might look on and say it is a bit peculiar, but it seems to work for both of them and they get something out of it.  I do not know what one would call it, but is it doing anybody any harm?  We must be rational about this.<\/p><p>  Clearly, there is a substantial difference between a mutual arrangement of convenience for two people who both benefit and somebody being exploited.  However, there is a social argument about marriage being rooted in exploitation anyway, and the old definitions when women and children were the property of the male partner.  There is no high moral ground on these issues.  Dealing in trafficking and exploiting people for sexual and other purposes is completely wrong, but this does not necessarily fall under the legislation.<\/p><p>I thought the points made were very valid.  I echo the points about same-sex marriages.  There is a view that we could legislate for them.  I do not believe it is controversial at all.  If there is a referendum, it will be overwhelmingly carried, but do we really have to go through all that?  Could we not legislate for civil partnerships for gay couples?  That is something that should be looked at.<br\/><br\/>Essentially the Bill gets to the heart of people's identity, their right to an identity at birth, an acknowledgement of their existence at death and to have that properly registered.  These matters are very important and I am glad to see a number of the measures included.<br\/><br\/>I want to deal with two aspects.  First is the position of the compulsory registration of fathers' names.  This is clearly necessary to underpin the rights of children under EU legislation in order to have access to their identity.  It is a very good thing.  Deputy Jim Daly made the point that this does not apply in a typical family, but that misses the point.  Much of the reason for introducing this legislation now is that there is no such thing as a typical family in Ireland or elsewhere.  The nuclear family of a male daddy, a female mammy and 2.3 children does not exist anymore.  We have a society with 217,000 children of separated parents in the State according to the most recent census.  We need to acknowledge that many of them are living in new arrangements with different half-brothers, half-sisters etc.<br\/><br\/>While I really welcome that fathers' names are being added, it does not change much for fathers.  There is a gaping deficiency in fathers' rights in our system at the moment.  It is a huge problem in the context of the modern family.  Having a right to have one's father's name on a birth certificate does not change that or give the father any extra legal rights.  This needs to be balanced.  We talk about rights and responsibilities, but responsible parents - separated fathers - were substantially undermined in last year's budget by the removal of the single-parent tax credit and the changes in that being given over to the primary carer.  The reality is that because the Irish courts system is based on the old traditional family model, 97% of separation cases deem the mother to be the primary carer, even in instances where there is 50:50 access.<br\/><br\/>In my area I know of one devoted father, who is separated, who had been contributing to the upbringing of his child.  His ex-partner was in another arrangement with another child from a different partner.  That woman wanted to share that tax allowance, recognising that she had two children from two different fathers, but it could not be done and that responsible father could not get any benefit back.  We can talk about rights and responsibilities, but we need to do much more and economic policies need to back up some of the changes we are talking about recognising on paper.<br\/><br\/>The other major absence from the legislation is one that was very well articulated by Senator van Turnhout in the Seanad, which is the position of adopted people and the deficit for them in the present scenario.  We know that Irish legislation prevents discrimination on many grounds.  However, adopted people are not specifically excluded from discrimination.  The State by its actions has actually defended practices of discriminating against adopted people.  While it is good that we are dealing with this Bill to ensure that parents born today of natural parents will have full access to their identity, the legislation does nothing for adopted people, including the 52,000 adopted people many of whom are adults who still do not have a legal right to trace all the information held by the State on their identity, but also some of the children as well.<br\/><br\/>Obviously adoptions in Ireland now generally take place outside the State and involve very small numbers of people.  Adoptions since the 1990s fall under the remit of the Hague convention on intercountry adoption, which in line with UN regulation guarantees the child's absolute right to identity of origin.  In order for us to be compliant with the Hague convention, the UN CRC and with best practice, Ireland should make every effort to note the adopted status on a child's birth certificate.  We are failing to take account of this.  Obviously they should have access to their original birth certificate from their original country of origin.<br\/><br\/>All of the welfare experts agree that what happened to so many Irish people who were illegally and secretly adopted, in many cases against the wishes of their mothers, was wrong.  We have had cases where birth mothers' names were not put on their birth certificates and instead the names of their adoptive parents were put down as their birth parents.  We have had many instances of people only learning they were adopted when their adoptive parents died.  It causes tragedy and heartache for people when their whole understanding of the person they thought they were is stood on its head.  It is a crime to do that to somebody.  All the welfare training shows that it is best to acknowledge children's identity straight up and deal with that as normal because there is no such thing as normal really.<br\/><br\/>Because many Irish adoptions are foreign-based adoptions, it is quite obvious that the parent is not the natural parent and that assists in dealing with these things.  Why can we not have the adoptive status on the birth certificate?  That would be a very good way forward.  Many Irish people were denied access to their original Irish birth certificate.  It is terrible that that still continues despite our ratification of the Hague convention.  In Britain and other countries, people have had a right to their original birth certificate since the mid-1970s and the roof has not caved in; life has gone on and it has been fine.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Justice and Equality when in opposition made great pronouncements about the need to protect information and the need for children to have the right to their identity.  However, when she became Minister for Children and Youth Affairs many of the statements she made in opposition were stood on their head and the excuses were given as to why people could not have access to this information.  It is not good enough.  We are in the final months of the Government's lifetime.  In the early years of it we were promised adoption information and tracing legislation.  We still have not even seen the heads of a Bill despite numerous promises I have got on it.  Our delay in this is based on a misinterpretation of the I. O'T <i>v<\/i>. B case and the false emphasis being placed on the privacy of the mother.  We know of the stories that have come out.  In many instances these women were unwilling to give up their children.  In many instances they did not know and did not sign anything.  They do not want their privacy protected and really what we are talking about protecting is State-enforced secrecy rather than privacy.<br\/><br\/>If we want to go forward in a proper way and deal fully with everybody's right to identity, that means everybody and it means adopted people as well - people being adopted now, but particularly the 50,000 or so adopted people who have been so sorely mistreated, many of whom came through the Magdalen laundries and so on.  While we are discussing this, we also need to overhaul that closed-adoption system in order to have a level playing field and ensure that all children of the nation are cherished and recognised equally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900014#M00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412850300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mitchell, who is sharing time with Deputy Lawlor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900015#N00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850300,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation that deals with recording the defining moments of our lives, our births, marriages and deaths - the records that establish our position and status within the State, and our relationship to one and another and to the State as citizens.<\/p><p>  I am particularly interested in the provision requiring the registration of father's names on children's birth certificates.  In introducing the 2012 Bill in this area, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, mentioned she intended to introduce this amending legislation.  I am delighted to see that promise being fulfilled now.  In truth it should probably have happened years ago and we should not have had to wait for EU direction to do it.  I believe every child has the right to know his or her parentage.  It is unacceptable that even as recently as last year, 2,675 children were born and registered without a father's name on their birth certificate.<\/p><p>I presume the number is roughly the same every year.  Apart from the rights of the child, if the father remains living in the same area over a number of years and has more children, whether marital or non-marital, it is not at all beyond the bounds of possibility - in fact, it is probably quite likely - that two of those children might meet without being aware of their shared parentage, which raises the possibility of relationships outside the permitted degree and certainly outside what would be wise.  As a small island country we should be expanding our gene pool, not reducing it.<\/p><p> I fully appreciate the reasons mothers have had in the past and still have today for leaving the father's name off the register.  These are complex issues and it is sometimes difficult to know what a person's motivation might be.  In some cases, it may genuinely be that the father is unknown.  In other cases, there may be a desire to have nothing further to do with the father or a belief that including his name on the certificate could in some way imperil the mother's entitlement to housing benefits or lone-parent payments.  Some mothers may fear that including the father's name could result in their being forced to live together.  In other instances, it might simply be that the mother does not want the child to know who his or her father is; there are all sorts of reasons that such might be the case.<\/p><p> The reality, of course, is that unmarried fathers in this country have very limited rights and responsibilities.  Moreover, those they do have do not come by way of a gift from the mother of the child but rather by virtue of their own parenthood.  However, whether a man is a good or bad father, an absent father or a present father, his child carries his DNA and therefore has a lifelong - in fact, a multi-generational - connection to him.  Not knowing one's parents has many implications.  For example, a person who does not know the identity of his or her parents is denied all types of health information that could be absolutely essential in terms both of preventative measures and treatment of illness.  Even setting that aside, it is every child's entitlement to have information regarding his or her identity.  This is a stand-alone entitlement of all children, even where such might be inconvenient for their parents.<\/p><p> I recognise that there may be good reason, in exceptional circumstances, that the father's name should not appear on the birth certificate.  The legislation makes provision for such cases, with a requirement that the mother give reason in writing for the omission.  Ultimately, the decision is made not by the mother but by the registrar.  Such circumstances are rare enough.  It might arise, for instance, where there is a criminal offence, such as where both mother and father are underage.  In cases of incest, to give another example, the mother might be in fear of her life if she were to put the father's name on the register.  Apart from these exceptional circumstances, the principle of inclusion of the father's name will apply.  It is important for mothers to know, in giving the name of the father, that there are no new rights for unmarried fathers under this legislation.<\/p><p> On the father's side, too, there can be an even greater incentive not to give his name.  Indeed, the one gap I see in the legislation is the lack of follow-up where a man does not accept the mother's word that he is the father.  I see how it might be problematic to follow up in such cases, but there seems to be no procedure at all to establish parenthood where a father denies it.  That is apparently the end of the process, with no penalty for non-co-operation.  This is a major weakness in the Bill.  If it is important to establish compulsory registration, we should be prepared to enforce it.  It may be difficult and costly and require DNA analysis and so on, but for the child's sake - that being the prime motivator and concern behind this legislation - it is important that every effort be made to establish parenthood.<\/p><p> I very much welcome the provision for the inclusion on the birth certificate of the PPS numbers of both father and mother.  This information could, in future, facilitate a system for ensuring all fathers meet their financial parental responsibilities.  Heretofore, the taxpayer has taken on the financial responsibilities of fathers who walk away.  Has the Minister considered the establishment of a separate register of non-marital fathers?  I understand that was a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  In Britain, for example, it is possible to identify the number of non-marital fathers who have multiple children with multiple mothers.  It may be that this type of information will be needed in the future if we go down the road of financial responsibility.  I do not know whether a separate register would actually be necessary; it may be that the inclusion of the unique identifier that is the PPS number would be enough to facilitate the extraction of that type of information.  I do not wish to suggest that all fathers are trying to avoid responsibility.  Of course that is not the case.  In fact, the reverse is true and most fathers do meet their responsibilities.  For those who do not, however, there is no reason for the taxpayer to continue picking up the bill on their behalf.<\/p><p> The Bill deals with other important issues which, however, do not have as wide-ranging an application as the provisions relating to joint birth registration.  There are provisions dealing with the regularisation of foreign embassy marriages, recording in Ireland of deaths of Irish citizens abroad, and the recording of neonatal deaths.  The latter, in particular, is a very welcome development.  In addition, the Bill clarifies the position regarding open-air civil marriage ceremonies.  Every Member has received representations on some or all of these matters.  It is encouraging to see that even a small number of citizens who are affected by some gap in the law can make representations and find their needs are met in a timely manner.  We can be proud of that achievement.<\/p><p> The provision regarding the sharing of information between Departments and State agencies is important and will help to streamline access to information and ensure citizens can access the most up-to-date services to which they are entitled.  If we want efficient and cost-effective services, we must ensure those who deliver the services have access to the necessary relevant information.  I cannot understand people who happily and thoughtlessly share the most intimate of information on Facebook and other social media but do not wish to provide State agencies with the most basic information necessary to ensure they can access good services.  It does not make any sense that they would deny the State that type of information.<\/p><p> I particularly welcome the provision for information sharing on births, marriages and deaths between our historical registers and the genealogical website of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I have an interest in genealogy and have spoken about this issue in the past.  This type of website is a great resource for any country which wants its citizens to have access to information about their past.  It is particularly so in a country like Ireland which has such a large diaspora.  It is a great boon to the tourism and hospitality industry.  I reiterate the point made by colleagues regarding the need to invest in the storage of our records and make them accessible to the public.  They are an irreplaceable part of our heritage which, unfortunately, were left in appalling conditions during the Celtic tiger years.  As resources become available, these records should be afforded the respect they deserve.<\/p><p> The Bill also attempts to prevent the practice of marriages of convenience.  I listened with interest to what Deputies Michael McNamara and Clare Daly had to say on this issue.  I say &quot;attempts&quot; because I see the provision as somewhat problematic to implement.  In fact, I suspect it might be open to constitutional challenge.<\/p><p>As a member of the Council of Europe's migration committee, I know of the desperation which drives migrants, the lengths to which they will go, the money they will pay and the risks they will take to have a better life in Europe.  I assure Deputies that getting married is the least of the risks they will take.  The Minister is absolutely right, however, to try to prevent this abuse of marriage, primarily because it is so associated with trafficking.  Where one has desperate migrants, one has greedy and ruthless smugglers and traffickers who will prey on them.  The Latvian Government made representations to us in the past about this because it was suspected that the EU citizenship of many Latvian girls was being used to establish the right to marriage in Ireland to non-nationals.  The large increase in numbers following the EU directive of marriages between non-Irish EU citizens and non-EU citizens would indicate there is a genuine problem.  Some 2,000 to 2,500 marriages per year amount to a lot of marriages.<\/p><p> It may not stand up to a constitutional challenge because the right to marry is protected under the Constitution and any attempt to change, reduce or limit that would need to be on very firm ground, and I wonder if this is on firm ground.  The impediments to marriage are matters of fact, such as one's age or marital status, but what we propose is to have another impediment to marriage, namely, a marriage of convenience solely for the purpose of creating immigration advantage.  Instead of it being an objective fact, the new impediment wanders into the area of intent, motivation or why one is getting married.  That is difficult to establish at the best of times.  God knows, as Deputy Daly said, why some people get married.  I am sure many people have gone up and down the aisle with all sorts of mental reservations about why they are getting married.  The landscape in Ireland is littered with examples of marriages of convenience, whether to do with land, money, pregnancies or otherwise.  They are, as we know, part of our history, but they have always been accepted by the State as valid marriages and they have never been questioned.<\/p><p> We are saying in this legislation that there is one kind of marriage of convenience which is not valid.  We are singling out one group of people and denying them the right to marry based on why they are getting married.  It is possible that could run into difficulties with the Constitution.  Having said that, it is right that we should try to do this, not least to try to tackle the trafficking associated with it.<\/p><p> I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill to the House.  Its measures reflect the significant changes we see in society.  Legislation has not always kept up with changes in society, but for once we can be proud that we are responding to some changes in a timely manner.  The Minister can be proud of her contribution in making the recording of those life defining moments, which are important but often traumatic for us, a little bit easier for citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900015#N00300","speaker":"1026","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412851500,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Mitchell about marriages of convenience and it is sad we have to deal with this.  As she indicated, there are many other types of marriages of convenience in the State which are not acceptable in modern Irish society but, unfortunately, we have not dealt with those in this legislation.  This is very subjective and, as Deputy Mitchell said, we like to deal with facts when it comes to people marrying and preventing them from marrying.  As she also indicated, there were circumstances, of which we all know, in which marriages of convenience took place which did not involve people trafficking or other nationalities.<\/p><p>  It is great to be in the House when dealing with legislation which is reflective of society.  There was a significant input from the people, who brought a number of situations and circumstances to Members of the House of the Oireachtas by way of meetings in clinics and with Ministers, and they have been brought to the floor of the House in this legislation which is reflective of modern society.  Legislation must move rapidly in order that we can reflect what is going on in modern society.<\/p><p>  I wish to speak about two issues, one of which I have spoken about on a number of occasions.  I refer to the &quot;Help bring them home&quot; campaign.  Most of us know people who, unfortunately, passed away overseas.  A person does not need to die overseas to be unable to have his or her death registered in this country in that he or she need only die in the North of Ireland.  That campaign highlighted that it is traumatic for families that the deaths of their relations are not recognised in this State.  In future, there will be a record.  When people looked for relatives, they could not find them because their deaths were not recorded.  I welcome this provision and thank the campaigners from &quot;Help bring them home&quot; for their hard work.  The Minister deserves credit for this also because she listened to society.<\/p><p>  The compulsory registration of the father's name on the birth certificate is an important provision in this legislation.  We all know the nuclear family in this society is changing dramatically.  There are more births outside wedlock than ever before.  It is important from the child's perspective that the father's name is registered.  Deputy Mitchell raised a point in regard to PPS numbers which may help to highlight this even further, and the Minister might take that on board.<\/p><p>  We have been advocating for the child's rights.  Deputy Daly mentioned the children's referendum and this is a follow-on from that.  I would be very supportive of this because children, who are our future, need to know their parents' identity.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Bill which is not so much reforming legislation as legislation catching up with society, something we need to take on board more often.  Legislation should reflect society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900017#P00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412851500,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1412851500,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900017#P00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851500,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins - the need to address the issues in the budget which discriminate against women; (2) Deputy Alan Farrell - the need to evaluate the secondary school requirements of Malahide and Swords; (3) Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall - the need to update regulations under the misuse of drugs legislation to curb the open street trading of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs; (4) Deputy Terence Flanagan - the need to introduce a cap on the interest that can be charged by moneylender loans; (5) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the importance of the retention of the 9% rate of VAT for tourism services; (6) Deputy Timmy Dooley - the need for a resolution of the Irish\u00a0airlines\u00a0superannuation scheme; (7) Deputy Robert Dowds - the ongoing industrial dispute at the Kishoge community college construction site; (8) Deputy Patrick O'Donovan - the need for immediate works to be carried out on the Newcastle West Garda station; (9) Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in - the alleged manipulation of hospital waiting lists; (10) Deputy Brian Stanley - the shortcomings in services for autistic children and their families in County Laois; (11) Deputy Joan Collins - the ongoing industrial issues with contractors at a school in Lucan, County Dublin; (12) Deputy Thomas P.

When John Saunders published the Mental Health Commission annual report for 2013 some months ago, he stated that in relation to younger service users, there is still a most unsatisfactory situation whereby children are being admitted to adult units where there were 91 child admissions to such units in 2013.<\/p><p>  The difficulty is that families throughout our country are under huge pressure because of unemployment, homelessness, pressures in general society, cyberbullying, drug addiction, and the many other problems they face.  The founder of Save our Sons and Daughters has said that children are at a higher risk of suicide and are becoming more vulnerable because there is a serious lack of experts employed, and there is only a handful of adolescent beds in our hospitals.  There are only 48 beds available to young children who suffer from mental health issues.<\/p><p>  It is a very serious position to be in that in 2014, two years after the children's referendum, adolescents with psychiatric problems who may have self-harmed or attempted suicide are still being admitted to adult units, which is wholly inappropriate.

A new framework document for suicide prevention for the period 2015 to 2018 is being developed.  That will build on the current strategy, which as I said has been widely praised by people involved in the area as being one of the best outlines of how to proceed in regard to a very important area of people's overall health and well-being.  It will build on the current strategy, and the objective is to have the strategy and the framework in place and completed by the end of this year.  Obviously, budget 2015 and the discussions of both the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will then determine the specific allocation of resources.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's question concentrated heavily on the number of beds.  The objective with regard to young people would be to have them treated and assisted in a community health environment.

It is not a case of the usual suspects to whom the Taoiseach referred.  These protests are taking place spontaneously.  Local residents, including children, are demonstrating their objections to the water charges.  I want to raise the question of the right to engage in peaceful protest, as guaranteed under Article 40 of the Constitution, which refers to \"the right of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms\".  These protests were taking place peacefully until someone somewhere decided to change the approach that was being taken.  As a result, peaceful protests are being forcibly broken up by large numbers of garda&iacute;.  People have been manhandled, pushed, pulled and shoved, in an aggressive manner in some cases.  There have been numerous arrests.  I will give an example.

Twenty-six garda&iacute; were taken from stations across Dublin to get involved in what was happening in Clare Hall.  The focus has switched today to St. Donagh's Road in Donaghmede, where over 100 residents have come out to protest.  There is a large Garda presence and two arrests have been made.  Is this not a strange use of limited Garda resources?  Does it not raise questions about political policing?  Is it right that the police force is being mobilised to break up popular resistance to an unjust tax?  These protests are going to spread.  It is not sustainable for the Garda to have such numbers policing these protests, which last all day.  Any suggestion that these peaceful protests can be crushed by the use of large numbers of garda&iacute; is fanciful.  I assure the T&aacute;naiste that the Government will see the real extent of the opposition to these water charges, and the anger that exists now that they have been imposed in addition to the property tax, on Saturday when tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of people will demonstrate in favour of the right to water.  Would it not be better for the Government to accept the reality now by scrapping the water charges?  A motion condemning the heavy-handed tactics that are being used to try to suppress these protestors was passed by Dublin City Council this week.

It might come as news to the Deputy that many people want the very bad situation that has existed in relation to investment in our water services to be changed and turned around.  One of the problems is that people in the country are on boil water notices because the water infrastructure is totally deficient.  A vigorous and expensive investment programme is needed to remove the lead pipes in significant parts of our urban areas, which need to be removed for the sake of older people and children.  High-quality water is needed in the greater Dublin region, in particular, so it can continue to attract a huge amount of construction and investment in jobs.  Then it can be done not just in Dublin, but also right around the country.

We welcome thousands of new immigrants to our shores while, regrettably, saying goodbye to those who have emigrated.  We saw the days of boom and burst.  This amending legislation is a responsive measure which will go a long way to responding to the changing Ireland we have before us.   To summarise, essentially, it records life events such as marriages and deaths.  That, in turn, will help modernise and give greater clarity to the records we keep in Ireland.<\/p><p>  There are three major amendments provided for in this Bill, namely, the compulsory registration of the father's name on the birth certificate; a tighter crackdown on marriages of convenience; and a record of deaths of Irish people abroad.  I am pleased it will be compulsory for the father's name to be placed on the birth certificate of any child born in Ireland.  The Minister of State is addressing an issue that for a long time was placed on the long finger.  The introduction of this provision will underline the rights of the child under EU legislation and allow them to have access to their own identities.  It allows the child to know who their biological father was.  It provides the child with a small sense of background.  It will also help future generations to trace their heritage, family history and roots.  <\/p><p>  The figure of 2,675 non-marital births where the father's name was not registered has been raised by Deputies over the years.  Those are 2,675 girls and boys who may never find out who their biological father was.  This amending legislation addresses this unsatisfactory situation.  I am pleased to see it placed on the Statute Book.  However, there are situations where there may be genuine reasons where the father's name is not registered.  The mother may not know the identity of the father or the mother may believe that providing that information would be harmful to the safety of the child.  I am glad to see that these reasons have been well and clearly defined in the legislation.  The compulsory registration of the father's name will add a greater sense of responsibility upon the biological father.  I would very much favour the introduction of compulsory maintenance payments from the father to the mother and from the mother to the father.<\/p><p>  During my 12 years in the Oireachtas I have come across situations of marriages of convenience on a few occasions.  It is a complex situation but I am glad that the Minister has laid out extensive groundwork and regulations to crackdown on these sham marriages.  For years people have abused Ireland's marriage laws.  This amending legislation will strengthen our existing laws and make it more difficult to arrange a marriage of civil partnership of convenience.  It is important that the Minister of State has introduced the concept of a registrar and a superintendent registrar.  The registrar will be allowed to investigate the proposed marriage to see if it genuine.  Meanwhile the superintendent registrar will also offer advice, clarity and will have the final say.  Therefore, we will have two people ensuring that the marriage is genuine.  <\/p><p>  I would like to follow up on a point made recently by the Irish Emigrant Support Centre about the position of the registrar.  I agree with its call to ensure both registrars receive cultural awareness and diversity training in advance of the commencement of these sections and recognise the cultural context in which the marriage is taking place.  If this is followed up on, we have a greater change of being able to clearly define who are the genuine couples hoping to get married and those who are not.<\/p><p>  The recording of deaths of Irish people abroad is an issue that has been personally championed by Members of both Houses.  I commend the Minister of State on listening to our views and taking on board our advice.  This amending legislation will introduce a record of deaths of Irish persons who are normally resident in the State who die while on short-term absences abroad.  While the documents will not replace the original foreign death certificate, the facts that families can record that death in Ireland will bring a small bit comfort to a distressing situation that we have all experienced at one point or another in our lives.<\/p><p>  I once again commend the Minister of State on introducing his first item of legislation, which is a complex one.  The amendments put forward in the legislation are important.  They will bring much greater clarity to areas of Irish life where previously there was none.  This Bill provides substantial changes to the 2004 Act and puts the registration services far more in tune and responsive to the Ireland we live in today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900023#V01700","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1412855100,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill, which will enact various improvements to the administration of civil registration in this State.  This amending legislation is broad in its capacity but I find the changes made to the registration of marriage and civil unions of key interest.  The right to marry is a fundamental right according to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  Article 41.3.1o of our Constitution commits the State towards guarding the institution of marriage with \"special care\".  If all of these documents, which form the backbone of our legislative powers, hold the institution of marriage in such a high regard, it is important that we closely analyse any attempts to limit or regulate that right.<\/p><p>  Although the definition of marriage can become the subject of intense debate, it is hard to imagine anyone encouraging the use of the institution of marriage for the purposes of circumventing our immigration laws and procedures.  In a 2011 High Court ruling, the decision was made that a marriage contracted for immigration purposes is valid under Irish law due to the lack of explicit legislation against such practices.  Allowing such a loophole to remain unchanged diminishes the authority of our naturalisation procedures. <\/p><p>  It is imperative to ensure that our civil registration process does not interfere with the work being done to accommodate and manage our immigrant population.  By putting into place this amendment to the Civil Registration Act, we can distinguish between those who want to use marriage for legitimate purposes and those who are attempting to manipulate the system.<\/p><p>  Our failure to legislate on this immigration breach has raised international concerns, particularly from Latvia.  There has been a rush of marriages that were allegedly responsible for trafficking Latvian women to Ireland with the intention of marrying non-EU nationals for the purposes of citizenship.  We cannot stand idly by and simply watch as Ireland is used as a haven for human trafficking.  We cannot allow our Republic to become the weakest link for those looking for an illegitimate reason to enter the European Union.<\/p><p>Most importantly, we cannot allow our negligence to affect the lives of vulnerable women from within the EU.  We must strive to make a positive difference through our interactions with member states, and making our immigration process airtight is a part of that commitment.  The issue is not marriages or civil partnerships based on economic benefits.  While it may be the optimal situation to be in love with one's partner, it is by no means a legislative requirement.  It is important that we keep in mind all of the prospective situations in which people may find themselves before we pass laws that might infringe on the rights of Irish citizens to determine their own lives.<\/p><p> Civil unions and marriages are not the only issues within the scope the Bill.  In particular, section 6 amends a great deal of legislation on the registration of a child's birth parents.  Over 35% of births last year were to parents outside of marriage.  In current law, only the mother's name need be registered in the circumstance of a child born out of wedlock.  This, unfortunately, leaves a child without a guaranteed right to know who his or her father is, which can bring great confusion into a child's life through no fault of his or her own.  It is also important to know one's lineage for practical reasons, such as establishing where family connections exist, and it might be problematic if such information is unavailable.<\/p><p> Exceptions are to be made, and this Bill allows room for negotiation.  Should a mother lack knowledge of who her child's father is, or should she find it to be detrimental to the safety or welfare of either her or her child, she may opt out of the new registration requirement.  This nuanced approach to birth registration ensures a fair and unobtrusive process will be used when gathering what can be sensitive information that is necessary for a number of legal and administrative reasons.  On this facet of the Bill, it is important that the rights of the child be placed at the forefront of our efforts to navigate this potentially controversial amendment.  Critics will rightfully point to the compulsory nature of birth registration as being somewhat unjust to women who find themselves in a position of potential vulnerability.  While it is not our responsibility as law makers to pry into the personal lives of our constituents, for us to take our focus off of the children in question would be a disservice to them.  Children born in this country have a right to know where they come from, and we must preserve their right to an identity above all else.<\/p><p> I firmly support our Government's push to streamline our civil registration processes.  The more we work to sharpen existing legislation, the more efficiently and effectively we can serve the citizens of our nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900023#V01800","speaker":"972","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412855700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I think the Deputies for their well thought out contributions today and last Tuesday, which are very much appreciated.  There will be time to broaden and extend the discussion further on Committee Stage.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014 is part of a suite of Bills introduced to modernise our civil registration service.  The first of these was the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2012 which provided for secular bodies to apply to conduct marriages.  Most people agree it was very successful legislation.  On 17 June 2014, the general scheme of the gender recognition Bill 2014 was published.  The Bill will give legal recognition to transgender people.  The Bill is being drafted and I intend to publish it later this year.  It is one of the priorities of my Department and me to bring the Bill before the House as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Bill before us today contains significant new provisions and provides a wide range of changes and improvements in the civil registration service.  The compulsory inclusion of fathers names on birth certificates, which has been mentioned in many contributions today, is one of the progressive elements because every child has the right to know the identity of his or her father and mother.  Current legislation does not require the mother or the father to provide the father&rsquo;s details when registering the birth if the parents are not married to each other.  The registration of the father's name on the birth certificate confers no additional rights on the father of a child, and this was touched on many times during the debate.<\/p><p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea raised points regarding how the changes will operate in practice if a woman makes a statutory declaration that she does not know the identity of the child's father when in reality she does.  In such a case, she is clearly committing an offence under the Statutory Declarations Act 1938 and section 69 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  In the case where a mother claims she does not know the whereabouts of the father, she would be required to supply his name and any further information on his identity, such as his last known address or contact details.  The registrar would then make all reasonable efforts to contact the man named as the father.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the extent of re-registration. The figure is approximately 1,000 instances of re-registration of a father's name at a later stage.  A number of Deputies raised the issue of marriages of convenience.  The Bill aims to address marriages of inconvenience - sorry, I mean convenience; we sometimes go there.  The Bill introduces measures to combat the occurrence of such marriages.  The right to marry is a basic right and EU citizens and their families have a right to move freely within the territories of member states.  These rights also apply to non-EU nationals who are spouses of EU nationals.  Irish society has greatly benefitted from the free movement of EU citizens across Europe.  However, criminal entities are abusing our system by using marriage laws in Ireland to gain an automatic right to residency in Europe.  The vast majority of marriages are consensual.  A key feature of the provision is to protect the safety of women, particularly vulnerable young women and there have been a number of contacts from embassies about this and the dangers of trafficking.<\/p><p>  The Bill includes an honest attempt to try to control this.  I direct Members to section 18 which outlines the roles and responsibilities of the registrar in detail, which did not exist previously.  Members might like to re-examine it.  We want to try to ensure women are protected in these circumstances and it is a very good amendment to the original Act.  The registrar has a good opportunity to form an opinion on whether a marriage is genuine.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea asked whether there would be an appeals mechanism.  The Civil Registration Act 2004 already provides for an appeal process where required.  The same process, which allows an appeal to the family Circuit Court, will be available in the case of such marriages.  Another question was whether legal aid will be available, and this is a matter for the Legal Aid Board and the courts.<\/p><p>  The provision for embassy marriages is a practical solution for what happened, and I covered it clearly in the earlier debate.  A number of marriages took place in embassies that were not clearly under Irish legislation, and the Bill will allow those marriages and civil partnerships to be recognised.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea queried the provision referring to the constitutional rights which arise in sections 19 and 26.  These sections cover the retrospective validation of embassy marriages and civil partnerships.  This is a fail-safe provision which is not unique in the legislation.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea has concerns and I hope this covers those concerns in a very clear way.  The provision is there because of a recognition that the sections could impact on people's property rights and the intention in such cases, if they ever arise, is that legislation will be clearly understood not to be attempting to curtail these rights.<\/p><p>It is not a new departure to have these types of provisions, particularly where the legislation will have some form of retrospective effect.  Civil partnerships which took place in embassies or diplomatic missions prior to the commencement of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010 will be provided for within this Bill.<\/p><p> Many Members covered the record of deaths abroad.  Deputy Kyne, Senator Healy Eames and other Deputies have raised this on a number of occasions.  It is accepted broadly across the House that the record of deaths abroad addresses those issues raised, especially by Deputy Kyne where he introduced a Private Members' Bill.  This is where we can see the reform that is coming into this Government.  The Private Members' Bill has informed an element of this legislation.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy covered the area of online access to historical records.  This is becoming ever more important.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell also referred to this.  It is covered clearly in this Bill, but we must be careful that citizens' privacy is also protected.  In the Bill, we are acting within the international norm.<\/p><p> Deputy Murphy also raised the General Register Office in Werburgh Street.  As a result, I intend to visit the office to see exactly what the Deputy means.  I will come back to her at a further stage in regard to the specifics because it is not within the Bill.<\/p><p> A number of Members raised the issue of registration of a baby in a very sad circumstances as a result of the mother's death late in pregnancy.  The legal issues arising here are being carefully examined.  Should it be determined that the existing legislation is inadequate, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Birth certificates were covered.  In the case of adopted persons, the Adoption Act 2010 provides for the option of two types of birth certificate for an adopted person - one states clearly that the person is adopted and the other is an abridged version.  The current provisions are there because people wanted the choice.  Before there would be any changes, there would need to be a much broader consultation.  There was an in-depth debate in the Seanad in this regard, and Deputy Daly has raised it again.  The issue has been brought to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who has responsibility for policy and legislation for adoption.

The Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Bill is the Government's response to that call.  I believe that this Bill will allow Ireland better compete for investment with other funds domiciled on an equal footing and will maintain Ireland's well-deserved reputation as a safe place in which to do business.<\/p><p>  This Bill introduces a new corporate vehicle - an Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle, ICAV.  The ICAV will provide a new platform for managers of collective investment schemes.  It will complement the investment companies, investment limited partnerships, common contractual funds and unit trusts structures that are already provided for in Irish law.  ICAVs will resemble in many ways companies established under company law but they will not be part of company law.  General company law provisions are often irrelevant or inappropriate to investment funds and, increasingly, EU company regulations are creating unintended consequences and unnecessary expense for funds.<\/p><p>  The Government and the funds industry invest significant resources in promoting Ireland to international investors as the very best place to domicile funds.  With the ICAV, Ireland will be able to offer fund managers a more complete range of corporate structures to meet their various needs.  The ICAV is the first really significant development on this front since the introduction of the common contractual fund ten years ago.<\/p><p>  Luxembourg has had a variable capital corporate structure specifically designed for undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, and alternative investment funds, AIFs, for many years.  Indeed, such structures can also be found in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.  What we are doing with the ICAV is not novel or untested, rather we are providing those whose job it is to secure investment and jobs for Ireland with the best tools to keep up with our competitors.<\/p><p>  The Irish funds industry is a key part of the internationally traded financial services sector - often referred to as the IFSC.  Some 5,671 investment funds are authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland while a further 6,962 are administered in Ireland.  This amounts to some &euro;1,563 billion in authorised - Irish domiciled - funds and some &euro;2,956 billion in funds under administration.  Some 13,000 staff are employed directly and indirectly in both the IFSC in Dublin and in a number of locations throughout the country - it is a myth that it is a Dublin-based sector.  Some 2,500 of these staff provide legal and accounting services and the industry generates significant direct and indirect Exchequer receipts annually.<\/p><p>  Throughout the difficulties of recent years, the funds industry has continued to perform well and generate jobs, driving growth in sustainable employment throughout the country.  Lest we forget, as I stated already, the funds industry in Ireland is not only based in the docklands of Dublin, but stretches out to provide high quality jobs throughout the country.  One need only consider the recent significant expansion in investment in local communities across the country by companies such as Northern Trust and State Street.  These and similar operators conduct their activities in locations as diverse as Limerick, Cork, Drogheda, Naas and Wexford.<\/p><p>  Why do we need to do more if we already have the right formula to make Ireland the world's leading alternative investment fund domicile, including highly educated and motivated staff, a conducive business environment and a regulatory regime which is responsive to the needs of industry while at all times ensuring the protection of the interests of investors?  Put simply, we need to do more because our competitors do not stop developing new structures and products, and if we are to continue to compete our innovation cannot stop either.<\/p><p>  The Irish funds regime does not stand alone.  This is a global industry with the US authorities and the EU playing lead roles.  We are also seeing moves to create a south-east Asian collective investment product to rival European and American funds.  Much of Ireland's effort goes into shaping the approach that Europe takes collectively to develop the industry through the UCITS directives and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.  We are currently intensively involved in negotiations on the money market fund regulation.  However, the precise legal structures upon which these funds sit remains a matter for individual member states to determine, and this is where the ICAV comes in.<\/p><p>  Under the Bill ICAV will operate as regulated collective investment schemes, in other words, as undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities or as alternative investment funds.  Collective investment schemes involve a vehicle for pooling the investments of investors in order to obtain professional management for their pooled assets.<\/p><p>The purpose of a fund is to invest the pooled assets for the primary benefit of the investors.  In the case of UCITS, these range from ordinary consumers saving for their retirements all the way to hedge fund managers in New York and London.  From Ireland's perspective, they all have one thing in common.  If their funds are invested in an Irish domiciled UCITS or alternative investment fund, we have a duty to ensure the funds are administered and supervised to the very highest international standards.  That remains the overriding objective of our policy on funds.  The ICAV Bill is part of that strategy.  Its purpose is to enhance the attractiveness of the Irish funds offering while maintaining the highest regulatory standards at all times.<br\/><br\/>Cost is one of the important factors in any decision to domicile a fund in Ireland and a key motivating factor in introducing the Bill is to create a cost-effective product which can compete on an equal footing with similar corporate structures for investment funds in other jurisdictions.  The advantage to certain investors of the ICAV is that it will stand apart from the huge body of company law rules concerning SMEs or multinational industrial conglomerates which seek to address the myriad forms of risk arising in normal commercial environments.  The ICAV structure keeps the investors in UCITS and AIFs far more up to date with the success or otherwise of the enterprise through daily net asset valuations, and they are assured that the investment policies and corporate governance of the scheme are subject to the independent control of third party depositories who are also closely regulated by the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>Another feature of the ICAV which will be attractive to investors is the potential for it to be tax transparent in certain jurisdictions.  This means, for example, that the tax authorities in the United States will be able to tax US investors directly on returns earned from an ICAV-based fund without taxing the fund directly.  For those investors, that has the advantage of bringing forward the opportunity to meet their ultimate tax liability and so avoid double taxation as well as interest payments which would otherwise be due.  The advantage should be seen in light of Ireland having already signed an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to assist in the implementation of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, which will ensure reporting on US investors to the US tax authorities by Irish fund managers of all relevant information.<br\/><br\/>I will outline to the House the key features of the Bill.  The first Part deals with preliminary matters and contains definitions used throughout the Bill, as well as giving the power to make regulations in specified circumstances.  The power of the Central Bank to make regulations and give directions on ICAVs and other regulated financial service providers is set out in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  The ICAV will be a corporate entity, with limited liability for investors, formed by two or more persons and with a registered office in the State.<br\/><br\/>The creation of a functioning ICAV involves two stages, as set out in Part 2, namely, registration and authorisation.  Regarding the first stage, the Central Bank of Ireland will maintain a register of ICAVs and will discharge functions similar to those undertaken by the Companies Registration Office, CRO, in relation to companies.  The provisions largely reflect the principles established for companies in company law.<br\/><br\/>The second stage is authorisation.  From the introduction of the UCITS regime in 1989, the Central Bank was appointed as regulator under the relevant UCITS regulations.  The regulations provide a mechanism for the bank to authorise the investment funds, and contain all the necessary rules and regulations that have to be complied with by authorised funds.  The most recent iteration of the regulations was made in 2011.  For convenience, this is referred to as the &quot;UCITS regime&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Separate from this regime, many member states, including Ireland, developed a parallel regime for collective investment funds.  For convenience, these are referred to as &quot;Non-UCITS&quot;.  In recent years, the introduction of the alternative investment fund managers directive has brought a harmonised European approach to the regulation of certain aspects of these investments, relating in particular to their management, but has stopped short of requiring a full authorisation process.  While the transposition of UCITS regulations contains a discrete authorisation process, it is necessary to provide a similar mechanism for the authorisation of ICAVs that propose to operate as alternative investment funds, and chapter 2 of Part 2 contains the necessary provisions.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with settled industry norms supported by the existing prudential regulatory framework, ICAVs operating as AIFs will be capable of operating separate sub-funds whose liability will be segregated from the other sub-funds.  Where an ICAV operates as an umbrella fund in this fashion, the enhanced governance rules set out in sections 36 and 37 will apply.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 deals with the shares of the ICAV and reflects provisions in place for funds which are incorporated under company law.  As with Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990 investment company, the ICAV will be able to take investments and redeem investments, resulting in a fluid capital structure.  The remainder of the provisions in this Part concern the maintenance of the register of members, and these also reflect established policy as set out in company law.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 concerns the appointment, removal and conduct of directors and to a large extent mirrors provisions in companies legislation.  The provisions help ensure the integrity of the ICAV and include a prohibition on the making of directors' loans.  ICAVs can only operate as regulated collective investments schemes and are subject to prudential regulatory requirements which far exceed those placed on trading companies.  The directors of ICAVs will face not only the same rules on restriction, disqualification and prosecution for misconduct but are also subject to the exacting rules on fitness and probity operated by the Central Bank of Ireland and its administrative sanctions regime, which can bring swift and tough justice for any misuse or abuse of their privileged positions.<br\/><br\/>The ICAV is ultimately a financial services vehicle and creates legal obligations, a breach of which may give rise to enforcement action under numerous pieces of funds legislation, including UCITS, AIFMD and Prospectus, among others.  Regardless of how the ICAV is structured, financial services obligations will continue to be enforced by the Central Bank.  In particular, the Central Bank will remain responsible for all the enforcement relating to the actions of the fund itself and the fund's participants and management.  Moreover, in addition to the capacity to seek the disqualification of a director, directors will be subject to the bank's fitness and probity regime.<br\/><br\/>The draft ICAV Bill contains 64 sections that give rise to an offence.  Due to the link with the Companies Acts, enforcement measures in relation to a large number of offences would fall within the remit of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement rather than the bank.  Such offences contained within the Bill deal with breaches of standard corporate governance requirements such as the retention of meeting minutes, failure to notify the appointment of a liquidator or failure to furnish information to a liquidator.  These offences are mainly relatively minor in nature.  Some, however, are more substantial, such as seeking the disqualification of certain persons acting as officers or directors.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also cross-applies to directors of ICAVs the restriction and disqualification regime that applies in the case of company directors.  In those circumstances, persons appointed as directors of ICAVs will have an appreciation and understanding of the regime with which they have to comply and how actions can be taken against them.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 concerns the meetings, including the annual general and extraordinary general meetings, of the ICAV.  Of particular significance in that regard is the capacity of the board to dispense with the holding of an AGM.  Members holding not less than 10% of the shares of the ICAV may, in any case, cause the convening of an AGM.  That is an appropriate measure for an entity which is already subject to strict prudential oversight by a national financial regulator.<br\/><br\/>The approach adopted in Part 6 to keeping financial information and to the preparation of financial statements and their audit is not<b><\/b>to replicate the more detailed accounting requirements contained in the Companies Act but to reflect the applicable requirements in both directives to which I referred.  That maintains the necessity to comply with specified accounting standards and, at a minimum, to give certain specified information.<br\/><br\/>Part 7 concerns the conversion of an existing collective scheme incorporated as an investment company to an ICAV.  This is necessary as not only do we expect promoters of new investment funds to adopt the ICAV as the bespoke solution to their requirements, but we expect that many existing fund managers will also want to avail of the advantages provided by the ICAV.<br\/><br\/>Part 8 sets out provisions relating to the appointment of a receiver, the winding up and the striking from and, if appropriate, the restoration to the register of an ICAV.  In each case those rules which apply to an investment company will cross-apply to an ICAV with the necessary modifications.  I am in the process of final review of the provisions to determine whether it might be better or desirable to set out slightly revised provisions in relation to the striking off and restoration of ICAVs from the register maintained by the Central Bank.  I would appreciate the views of Members on the matter and, if necessary, I will bring forward some amendments in the area on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>Part 9 contains miscellaneous provisions, including the penalties for offences under the Bill, provisions for the inward migration of foreign fund structures to become ICAVs and <i>vice versa<\/i>, and the division of enforcement responsibilities between the Central Bank and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<br\/><br\/>It must be acknowledged that the ICAV Bill is largely a technical one.  While it may not engage the interest of many beyond this House or beyond those in financial and legal circles, in considering its merits I ask that we all bear in mind that it is a measure that will have real and lasting meaning for the economy, the taxpayer and, most important, for those young and not so young people who will reap the benefits of new investment funds domiciling in Ireland as a direct result of what we are doing today.  The new ICAV structure will serve to maintain the strength of Ireland as a funds domicile and increase direct and indirect employment in the funds sector.<br\/><br\/>I hope the outline of the legislation I have provided gives the background and context underlining the benefits which will arise from the Bill.  I very much look forward to a constructive debate and to hearing the contributions of Members working collectively to ensure we will put in place legislation that will protect and enhance competitiveness and attractiveness to investors as we set about looking at how we can continue to improve and advance the financial services sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900025#X01100","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412856900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, well in steering through his first legislation as Minister of State with responsibility for the international financial services sector.  I assure him that we in Fianna F&aacute;il will support the legislation.  Since the Irish Financial Services Centre was established in 1987, Ireland has established itself as a significant player in international finance.  A dilapidated swathe of the quays that scarred the city of Dublin has been transformed into a thriving hub of global funds.<\/p><p>Every day some 13,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in both the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, in Dublin and across a number of locations throughout the country.  Financial services and the funds sector have a significant presence in Cork.  Its success has been a major boost to the entire economy and, following the financial storms of the past six years, it offers fresh opportunities for job creation and growth.<\/p><p> The creation of the Irish collective asset management vehicle is a move towards further realising the industry's potential.  However, this demands a renewed commitment by the Government to a strong regulatory framework and focus on the industry.  In a fast moving sector, financial innovation constantly challenges legislators and regulators to respond in order to keep pace.  Today's Bill is a step towards enabling Irish financial services to catch up with their EU competitors with a new investment vehicle.  The legislation comes after a period of decline in the financial industry overseen by this Government.  We have slipped from 10th place in the global finance index in 2008 to 70th in last month's survey.  This dramatic drop underlines the need for Ireland to diversify its offerings in a competitive marketplace and restore our regulatory reputation.  If the Government is serious about achieving the aims of its five year strategy for the international financial services industry in Ireland, it needs to raise the game.  The serious drop in our international ranking does not bode well for job creation in the sector.<\/p><p> The scale of the industry, with some &euro;2.7 trillion in funds and 13,000 jobs, highlights the importance of underpinning a sustainable industry.  The sweep of the five year strategy has real potential for further expansion but requires serious and consistent commitment by the Government.  If the Government takes its eyes off the ball, as it has done to date, it will miss an opportunity to renew focus on the sector and deliver the improvements required to make it more competitive.  The financial services environment is now very cut-throat and competitive - ultimately it is the most mobile form of investment and things can change overnight.  There is too much at stake to risk the future of the industry and the broader role it plays in our economy by being complacent.  It was complacency that caused the massive drop in our international ranking in the global finance index.<\/p><p> In discussing the creation of a new financial vehicle model, it is important that we deal with the regulatory framework.  The financial crisis, which continues to linger over the eurozone, has illustrated the need for a strong regulatory system to keep market excesses in check.  The hard pace of innovation is not just a competitive challenge for Ireland, but also a regulatory one.  The harsh lessons of the past six years cannot be forgotten or we risk being thrown back into the market turbulence that wreaked havoc here and globally.<\/p><p> The Central Bank is at the heart of efforts to keep abreast of new fund models.  This requires a mixture of legal tools and key personnel equipped to implement them.  Solid regulation is vital in building a strong reputation for business to grow and providing consistent, reliable rules to protect consumers.  As the industry grows and expands with greater financial rewards available, the importance of attracting and retaining skilled personnel will become even greater.  Adequate resources to oversee and maintain the industry are of paramount importance.  The systemic risks of mobile capital to the economy demand greater vigilance than was shown before the financial crash - anything less than that is flirting with future disaster.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that a strong financial sector is an integral part of a modern economy, particularly a modern Irish economy.  Used well, it targets investment where it is best deployed to create new jobs and stimulate economic growth.  It empowers people to realise the dream of home ownership and plan their retirements with a sense of security.  Enabling new models, such as the Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV, outlined in this Bill, creates new avenues for investment as well as strengthening Ireland's global position.  Combined with solid regulation, it is a step towards sustainable recovery for this country and the financial services sector can be a key driver of that recovery.  It is vital that we learn from the past to place financial services on a sound footing for the future.  In this light, I welcome the Bill and its potential.  I look forward to dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage and any future legislative action by the Government drawn from its five year strategy.  I hope that this legislation marks a revitalised focus by the Government on this important industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900026#Y00200","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412857500,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

It is interesting that this Bill was not mentioned in the programme for Government and it is clear that it is not at the top of the agenda in housing estates and villages.  It is an important piece of legislation but perhaps the Bill to protect mortgage holders whose mortgages are owned by vulture funds or the Bill offering redress for women who were in Magdalen laundries should have come first in the queue.<br\/><br\/>This Bill relates to the IFSC strategy paper and is a product of the IFSC Clearing House Group, which is an unhealthily influential group of officials and business interests.  In this group officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners sit with financial businesses and make plans for the future.  The latest minutes available from the Clearing House Group, from February 2014, note that the representative of the Irish funds industry: <blockquote>highlighted an area of opportunity under the AIFMD Directive which is not currently accessible to Irish funds.  If addressed it could afford greater control and certainty to institutions and investors and would provide an additional product offering to the funds industry.  He requested engagement between the various stakeholders to address this gap in Ireland's offering.<\/blockquote>Am I right to presume that the source of this comment developed this Bill?  I know of many community groups and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working with vulnerable people who would love to have such influence.  The question of influence does not stop at the Bill's conception.  The website of one leading establishment legal firm proudly states that it was &quot;a contributing member of the legislative group responsible for the preparation of the ICAV Bill&quot;.  It is happy to take any questions on it, apparently.  At this point of scrutiny it would be healthy to have the full list of contributors to this Bill for the sake of transparency.  Who drafted the Bill and which inputs were significant?<br\/><br\/>The funds industry is an important employer in the State and one which is performing well.  According to the industry itself, it employs 13,000 people with net assets under management in Ireland of over $1 trillion. That figure puts next week's budget in context.  Such employment brings huge benefits but a broader analysis of the impact of the funds industry in the State is needed - in areas such as tax and regulation, for example.  It is important that close scrutiny be paid to a trillion-dollar industry.<br\/><br\/>My instinct is to approach some aspects of the Bill with great caution.  Part 6 of this Bill allows for what could be called a relaxation of accountancy demands on these new ICAVs.  I understand many in the industry find the current rules overly cumbersome and unsuitable for the industry but accounting rules have arrived at the point they are at through trial and error.  Some have pointed out that the banking collapses of recent years can be traced to lax scrutiny of accounting practices and differing interpretations of rules, among other things.  I urge caution and careful scrutiny of this section in particular.  Similarly, the removal of the obligation to hold an annual general meeting, AGM, flies in the face of long-standing governance structures.  I understand that an AGM for a fund is not likely to be as well attended or controversial as recent bank AGMs but making it an option to have no AGM, unless 10% of shareholders object, is a big step.<br\/><br\/>It has been noted that this Bill does not have the same conditions on risk diversification as other existing models and, again, I point out that there are reasons why such conditions exist.<\/p><p>The Bill moves the regulatory duty for ICAVs from the normal remit of the Companies Registration Office and instead will see these bodies monitored by the Central Bank.  I will seek evidence that this conforms to international best practice and, crucially, that the Central Bank has the capability and resources to provide sufficient oversight.  The industry informs us that 15% all funds in the EU are based in Ireland.  In terms of <i>per capita <\/i>this is a very impressive return.  The Bill seeks to safeguard this performance and go a step further.<br\/><br\/>Let us be clear that the Bill has two main aims: to compete with Luxembourg and to allow for greater US investment by making ICAVs eligible as &quot;check the box&quot; companies under US tax law.  On Committee Stage I will seek greater clarification on whether these goals are worthy.  Luxembourg is a very small state with an incredibly large financial sector.  We must think long and hard about how much our rules will be dictated by trying to compete with such a specialist country.  I will also seek greater clarification on what this will mean in real terms.  What will it mean for Irish taxpayers?  Given the ongoing EU investigation this should be examined closely, particularly the changes with regard to US companies.  I look forward to clarification on these issues from the Minister before Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is technical but this does not mean it should be given a fee pass.  There are questions about how such an industry-specific Bill came before us and questions as to who wrote the Bill.  We must consider the benefits and disadvantages to the State and the risks to which the State is open.  We must ask how sustainable a model which chases Luxembourg as a financial model can be, and whether creating law in our Parliament to avail of a provision of US tax law is a good, well-thought-out idea.  I look forward to detailed examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It needs to be teased out in detail and I look forward to engaging with the Minister and others on individual sections to get more transparency and understanding of whether they are of benefit to the State or pose risks to it in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900027#Z00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412858100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Is it agreed the next two speakers, Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Shane Ross, will share time?

It stated whether the economy goes up or down one can make money.  This follows quite a widespread pattern of advertisements on radio stations these days which speak about spread trading and how one can make money out of thin air.  If one has a bit of money one can give it to firms which will gamble on one's behalf.  They are very professional gamblers, and whether the economy is going up or down and whether people are miserable or happy there is always a way to make money out of the situation.  I find this obscene.  I find it almost beyond belief this is not banned, if not heavily regulated, after what happened to the global economy.<br\/><br\/>This is typical of the madness of the way in which the international economy works now, which lay at the back of the global financial crisis we had.  Anonymous fund managers sitting behind screens in financial hubs operate as sophisticated gamblers, whether in London, New York or, as the Government is keen to develop, the Irish Financial Services Centre.  There is not a lot of difference, if any difference, between this and people who study the form of horses and work out ways in which one is guaranteed to win.  Anybody who knows anything about gambling, addiction and how the system works knows there are far more losers than winners.<br\/><br\/>Gambling on horses is at a relatively small scale, which perhaps impacts detrimentally in many cases on the individuals involved, but when one blows this up onto a large scale one realises the world economy works like a bookies but it affects the lives of millions of people and has the capacity to destabilise entire economies.  Money can move at the flick of a switch from one place to another in a way which destabilises real economies and real things being made and produced, which are important and which society needs.  These things are moved around and investment in them surges in one area and collapses in another because of decisions made by these funds which deal in hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of euro.  They decide money can be made in one place or, because somebody else is losing money, they wait until the market collapses and move in to buy up everything so they can start another upward surge and sell before the whole thing goes belly-up again.  This is what is going on and this was the background to the international financial crash.<br\/><br\/>For a very brief period there was talk of perhaps looking at it, wondering about the tooth and claw unregulated markets and perhaps thinking about regulation.  Even when the likes of those of us on the left, who think there is a fundamental problem with operating an economy on this basis, asked whether lessons should be learned, people agreed they were in favour of more regulation and stated they would introduce measures for regulation.  Some of these might almost appear to be convincing until one sees something like this or real estate investment trusts, REITs.<br\/><br\/>The press is not here now, but in two years time when it becomes a real problem or we discover something very serious is happening a journalist will develop an interest in it.  At present nobody is here, and nobody really knows what these things are, but this is very important.  We are speaking about an extraordinary &euro;1.6 trillion in authorised funds domiciled in this country and &euro;3 trillion in funds under administration.  Mind-boggling amounts of money are being managed or channelled through the Irish financial services industry.<br\/><br\/>I will be happy to hear the Minister of State tell me I am totally wrong on this, but I had to look at KPMG's report on the ICAVs and to me they look like a means through which big investors can avoid tax and regulation, and we are trying to lure this type of business into Ireland.  It is spelled out very clearly in KPMG's document:<blockquote>As an ICAV will not be a PLC as defined by the Companies Acts, it will not have to comply with the provisions of those acts.  As a result, administrative costs will be reduced and ICAVs will be future proofed against unintended consequences arising from changes in Irish and European company law.<\/blockquote>Whoopee for the investors, who will be insulated from the law at Irish and European level and will face lower administrative costs because there will not be much regulation to deal with.  This is with regard to trillions of euro.  We are promoting this type of business so that big investors dealing in hundreds and millions of trillions can avoid the law and regulation.<br\/><br\/>The other big issue is tax.  The KPMG document states:<blockquote>The main advantage of the ICAV is that it will be able to make an election under the US &quot;check the box&quot; rules to be treated as a transparent entity for US federal income tax purposes.  This will allow an ICAV to be treated as a &quot;partnership&quot; (if it has more than one investor) or a &quot;disregarded entity&quot; (if it has only one investor) for US tax purposes, and so allow US taxable investors to avoid certain adverse tax consequences which would normally apply to PFICs.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>In contrast, an Irish fund established as a plc cannot use the &ldquo;check the box&rdquo; option because it is deemed to be a &ldquo;per se&rdquo; corporation.<br\/><br\/>This is, therefore, a way of avoiding tax.  It goes on:<blockquote>In addition, while an ICAV may elect to be treated as a transparent entity for US federal income tax purposes, it will, in general, be respected as a corporate entity in most other jurisdictions.  This can be advantageous, as many jurisdictions provide for more favourable tax treatments in respect of dividends and gains on share transfers.<\/blockquote>It is, therefore, about avoiding tax and about us creating conditions favourable to that sort of tax avoidance.  It goes on:<blockquote><i>The ICAV and Irish taxation<\/i><br \/><br \/>ICAVs also benefit from an attractive Irish tax regime which means:- no Irish income tax at the fund level<br \/><br \/>- no Irish withholding tax on all distributions to non-Irish investors...<br \/><br \/>- no transfer taxes on the issue, redemption or transfer of shares<br \/><br \/>- access to Ireland&rsquo;s extensive double taxation agreements...<br \/><br \/>- exemptions from Value Added Tax...<\/blockquote>I find it beyond belief that this is what we are up to.  When the REITs thing came up two years ago, I was one of the few people - perhaps the only person - who queried it.  We were giving tax incentives to these real estate investment trusts which came in when they saw the property market on the floor, something we paid for.  They started buying up massive amounts of Irish property and gaining control of the Irish property market as a result of the crash.  These are the same types of investors - maybe not exactly the same people but I suspect some of the same people - who got us into the mess in the first place, for which we have paid an extraordinary price.  We are now facilitating them yet again with tax incentives and laws that permit this type of stuff.<br\/><br\/>It is madness.  What is even worse is that we will not even impose a 0.1% financial transactions tax on these people.  We are told they would run a mile from a 0.1% tax.  That is the excuse for not doing it.  We are told that all these guys would be frightened away if we put a 0.1% tax on them, which the European Commission estimates would raise between &euro;490 million and &euro;700 million.  Let us call it &euro;500 million on the conservative end, which happens to be the same figure as the water charges.  Let us think about fairness.  Is it fair on low and middle income families who have been hammered repeatedly by the universal social charge, pension levies, pay cuts and property taxes, many of whom are in poverty and literally do not know if they will be able to pay the bills?  Is it fairer that we lash another &euro;300, &euro;400, &euro;500 or &euro;600 tax on them per year or that we put a 0.1% tax on all the trillions of euro going through the financial services sector, in this speculation and gambling sector?  The answer to that question seems fairly obvious.<br\/><br\/>The Government claims it has no alternatives to imposing harsh austerity and that it hurts it more than it hurts the people, and so it has to do it.  It does not, because it could just impose a tax of one tenth of 1% on this stuff and we could raise the same amount of money and probably more, but it will not even do that.  Instead we are passing legislation that is about reassuring these guys that if they want to pay as little tax as possible and be subject to as little regulation as possible, Ireland is a good place to come.  We are a haven for that kind of thing.<br\/><br\/>I would be very suspicious.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will say it is all much more complicated than that and that I do not really realise how beneficial all this stuff is and that there are 1,300 jobs in the Irish Financial Services Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900028#AA00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412858700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>It is 13,000, but it does not matter though.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900029#BB00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1412858700,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Sorry, 13,000.

I do not think it is a good idea for the future of employment in this country or for a sustainable economy for us to become hostage to these people, which is what we have become.  At the moment the world is claiming that these corporate entities that are avoiding tax - the big multinationals, the wealthiest corporations in the history of the world - are doing everything they possibly can to pay little or no tax.  Everyone says we should do something about this.  Then everyone says it is very difficult for us to do anything on our own, that we cannot do anything about it because it is an international problem.  What does it mean that we cannot do anything on our own?  It means we are hostages to them.  We cannot do the right thing because we are afraid of them.  We are afraid of them because we have allowed ourselves essentially to become hostage to them and to become prisoners of their money.  That is not a very good idea.<\/p><p>  First, it is grossly unfair.  Second, it greatly disadvantages domestic industry, real industry, the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the big employers and could develop a sustainable economy that would not be vulnerable to massive shocks of the sort we have seen in recent years.  That is what we need to build up.  That is the strength that will get us through the casino ups and downs of the global markets.  Instead we have a Government policy that is disproportionately and overwhelmingly geared towards making Ireland an attractive option for the very forces that have created such instability and crisis in the European and global economy.<\/p><p>  It is crazy from every point of view, from a moral point of view and from an economic point of view.  I accept it is possible to get temporary ups from it.  Capitalism is a system of booms and slumps.  The problem is the Government is cheering on the boom and when the slump comes, everyone is asking what the hell happened.  It might just look like ups and downs on a graph, but real lives are being destroyed by it.  This stuff represents the economics of the lemming.  We should move away from the economics of the lemming before we charge over the cliff once again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900029#BB00500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1412858700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>When the IFSC was set up, I believe in 1987, I was one of those who moaned about it and was a detractor.  I said it would never work and the jobs targets were far too high.  I regarded it as an election gimmick, one of Charles Haughey's mad ideas.  When I said this, I was cheered on by the leading socialists of the day, who were hoping it would not work for reasons of ideology.<\/p><p>  I was wrong; that happens too.  If one embarks on the bold business of making predictions, one sometimes gets it badly wrong.  I am glad to say I was wrong.  I am glad that due to the efforts of IDA Ireland and other organisations which would not be my favourite semi-State bodies and due to some fairly strange massaging and extraordinary concessions given to AIB and Bank of Ireland to make them move into the centre and which meant the centre was initially featherbedded, it succeeded.<\/p><p>  The IFSC with its various functions has become a recognisable success in the global world of finance.  I say that without apology.  It has also done something very important.  It has provided an extraordinarily large number of jobs.  To do that it has had to do something I see very little shame in, which is make tax concessions to outside companies to attract them to come here.<\/p><p>It is the same argument as applies in favour of corporate tax, which is about attracting multinationals.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether we want those companies that come into the IFSC.  Are we so pure that we should be telling them we do not want them here because we do not like the way they do business and because they are too big and powerful?  I do not want to live in a country that is barren but pure.  I do not want to live in a country that says to these types of companies that we do not like what they do and they should go somewhere else and allow us to live in poverty instead.<\/p><p> There have, of course, been problems with a large number of the companies that have come here.  Nevertheless, I say God bless the multinationals and the employment they have given us.  God bless the foreign funds that come here.  I say this as one who has benefited as a director of one of these companies.  In fact, at this time, I am a director of a company that is registered in the IFSC.  While declaring that interest, I emphasise the benefits these companies give to the country.  The multinationals that come here are not acceding to the classical trade union diktats in respect of their workers.  They are not acceding to the sort of culture we prefer here.  They are, however, providing jobs and making us more prosperous.  That is very important to people in this country and to the Government.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett is right in much of what he says in so far as he related the facts about what the Government is about here.  This is a deregulating Bill.  The Government is very coy about that, but it is a fact.  I have read the briefing notes on the legislation and listened carefully to the Minister of State's speech, but there is no mention anywhere that this is about deregulation.  Why should the Government be coy about it?  The purpose of that deregulation is to attract finance which would otherwise go to London, Luxembourg or the United States.  That is what we are about here.<\/p><p> I share the fears of everybody in this House regarding deregulation.  However, there is a world of difference between what happens to the retail investor and what happens to the large investor.  The people this will attract are those who are called professional investors, which might be a euphemism.  We are talking about parties who will invest hundreds of millions in one go.  Indeed, the Minister of State referred to funds in the trillions.  These are sophisticated people who understand, on the whole, the risks they are taking.  We certainly could, if we like, tell them to go away and spend their money in Luxembourg because we do not want it.  It seems to me, however, that if they are doing nothing that is utterly immoral, which they are not, then we cannot live in an ivory tower about what is happening here.  Our position must be that we welcome this particular industry and its activities but we must regulate them properly.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath pointed out that our ranking as an international financial services centre has sunk from being almost in single digit figures into the 70s.  That is very serious.  The Bill before us today is one way of tackling that.  My guess, however, is that our reputation is sinking for a reason which is not tackled in this Bill and which has in many ways got worse, namely, that our regulator has lost the confidence of many international global investors.  I do not say that lightly.  The Central Bank in Ireland, which we have done so much to seek to improve and prop up, does not have the same reputation as the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and other national regulators.  What is often ignored in these discussions is what has happened since the crash of 2007-08.  In the case of Custom House Capital, to give one example, retail investors were fleeced.  The Central Bank was utterly asleep on the job and is still unable to do anything.  That issue is a running sore for retail investors.<\/p><p> Another very serious issue is reflected in a comment I heard the T&aacute;naiste make this morning to the effect that the Central Bank is an independent body.  That is news to me.  In fact, it is only nominally an independent body.  This week, two directors, Mr. Michael Soden and Mr. Des Geraghty, were reappointed to the board of the Central Bank by the Minister for Finance.  If I were an outside investor considering taking a risk with my money in any of these funds, I would be asking what in the name of God is the Minister doing appointing Mr. Des Geraghty to the board of the Central Bank.  What is more, in the past five years, that individual has been chairman of the bank's risk committee.  Mr. Geraghty has many great qualities but what in the name of God he is doing on the board of the Central Bank, I do not know.<\/p><p> These appointments tell outside investors all they need to know about how we do business in this country in terms of regulation.  We were promised in the past week that people would be appointed on the basis of talent or expertise.  Under the radar, however, we have somebody who happens to be a former president of SIPTU, a member of the Labour Party, a militant believer in social partnership and great supporter of the current Government landing a lucrative position on the board of the Central Bank without any knowledge that we know of, according to his CV, of banking, central banking or regulation.  He knows a lot about being a member of God knows how many political parties, but there is no justification for the Government appointing him or people like him to these positions.<\/p><p> We must ask ourselves how we can have confidence in the Central Bank when people who are cronies of people in Government have regularly been appointed by this and the previous Administration.  A former Governor of the Central Bank was a member of Mr. Bertie Ahern's dig-out gang.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900029#BB00600","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412859300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I advise the Deputy that while he may speak about individuals, he should refrain from mentioning names.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900030#CC00200","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1412859300,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I apologise, Chairman.  This has been happening continually.  There was blatant political imposition of Governors onto what was the old Financial Regulator and the old Central Bank.  There is no question that this went on.  Indeed, it was partly responsible for the crisis we found ourselves in, because these guys did not know what was going on.  It was one of the principal causes of the crash, although there were lots of others.  If we have a regulator in which key personnel are asleep on the job and people are not appointed on the basis of expertise, this is the sort of thing that happens.<\/p><p>  The confidence we expect from global investors has been lost because we have failed to recover from the appalling situation where people were appointed to the boards of banks on the basis that they were part of a global magic circle.  They, too, were asleep on the job and thereby contributed to the crisis.  The problem today is that this has not changed.  Month after month, we see the usual suspects - I will not mention any names - appointed to the boards of Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and other institutions.  We see people who got off those boards some years ago coming back, with political approval, and being given appointments.<\/p><p>One sees it on the board of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Irish Life which have what are called \"public interest directors\" who are basically political stooges being put, and kept, on these boards for no purpose.  I cannot see what they do.  There is a flaw in the system which is so extraordinary, it is impossible to believe it continues.  These people do not even have to stand for re-election.  They are there at the whim of the Minister, to whom they are not accountable.  The last time I asked a parliamentary question about this - I must ask another one - the Minister, as far as I could discern, almost never met them.  They were accountable to the board itself, which could not remove them.  They were not accountable to the shareholders, who cannot remove them either because they never come up for re-election.  Without naming them, many of these people wear their political colours on their chests.  At least three, of whom I can think, are former Ministers.  I do not know what they know about banking or what qualifications they have to be on the boards of banks but they certainly have political loyalties which cannot be said to be in any way useful, because they do not report to anybody, and these obviously overshadow any expertise they have.  <\/p><p> When the Minister of State replies to this debate, will he respond by saying the Central Bank can be improved?  The Central Bank of Ireland is full of people who should not be in it.  Look at what happened to the last deputy governor.  We had this sheriff riding in from overseas to clean up the Central Bank of Ireland, and people welcomed him with open arms.  We thought there was great hope coming through, and this is no disrespect to the Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, who has wonderful intentions for the Central Bank.  However, the last deputy governor was brought in from overseas with, as far as we know, this truly independent outlook, which is a rare thing in Ireland, specifically because of the problems I mentioned and because he was different.  However, he left long before his contract was due to end.  The reason for that was that he shared the disillusionment I am expressing here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900030#CC00300","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412859900,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I found the last two contributions interesting, especially that by Deputy Ross.  We should probably discuss the whole idea of Ireland's reputation in international financial services at some point.  We went through a very difficult period of time a number of years ago, partly due to the international crisis, and some reputational damage was done to Ireland.  However, it is important for us to correct that reputational damage and ensure we do things to acceptable international standards.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's hankering back to making things has a playful naivety about it but the world has moved on dramatically.  It reminded me of comments made at the launch of the original iPhone.  I do not know to whom the comments are attributed but someone said he thought it would come to nothing.  No doubt he rued the day he made those comments publicly.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to go to banking and financial services of the pinstripe suit, the bowler hat and the black umbrella but the world has moved on.<\/p><p>  One of the biggest issues with which we are now dealing is global trade and global taxation.  We have an open economy and are very involved in global trade and global taxation.  When global trade took off a century ago, the biggest issue was tax treaties between nations, which allowed for trade to be taxed in one jurisdiction only.  It was all about ensuring profits and investment were not taxed in two jurisdictions, that is, double taxation.  Over the last century, the pendulum has swung back and the issue is of no taxation in this jurisdiction, and that is where much of the discussion is focused currently.  Preventing double taxation in the last century was also a global issue and it was resolved by up to 3,000 global taxation treaties.  The solution to the current problem will also be a global one.  <\/p><p>  That is why the discussion currently is very much at OECD level, involving 50 of the world's developed nations, including Ireland.  It has been heavily involved in the global taxation debate and global taxation avoidance issues since 1999.  This discussion has been going on for the past five years.  The G20 has made this a key issue to be addressed in the coming years.<\/p><p>  If one listened to some individuals in this House, one would think the only country which needed to look at itself was Ireland.  This is a global issue.  We are not involved in any criminal money-laundering.  We have the most open and transparent system, which may not, to some degree, be to our advantage because it makes it easy to beat up on us as it is easy to see where our taxes go and how we tax people.  Many countries have very opaque systems of taxation, especially when it comes to large multinationals or even large conglomerates in their countries.  <\/p><p>  At times there is a need for us to stand up for what we are doing well.  The Irish Financial Services Centre is something good.  We are recovering in terms of getting our reputation back.  One of the things which attracts investors to this country is that we have a very sound legal system.  It is a very competitive country in terms of keeping costs down and having the right calibre of people to administer these funds.  We are attractive to investors, because these things are very important to them, and also to employees who want to come to work with these companies.  Many of the employees who work in these types of services are of the highest calibre and they are difficult to attract.  One should not for one moment believe that all we need to attract these individuals is to speak English and have a well-educated workforce.  If one visits the areas in which Google, Facebook and LinkedIn are located in the evening, one will see that people from every nation in the world are working in those companies.  That must be borne in mind.<\/p><p>  One thing at which we have got particularly good over the past few decades is innovating and changing how we do business, whether it is Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or the civil servants who lead these policies in the Department of Finance and other Departments.  We constantly innovate and evolve how we do business and constantly keep up with the way international business is carried out.  As soon as we stop, we will be dead in the water.  When we see problems in Departments and in parts of the public services we are supposed to provide, the major problems are in the ones which fail to reform, innovate and evolve.<\/p><p>  I do not consider myself an expert in collective investment or transferable securities or understand what the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive is all about but what I do know is that international financial services and banking are a vital part of our economy.  It is not only those 13,000 individuals who represent every nation in the world and who are so important to us, this spreads beyond them.  Ireland, for instance, is a leading nation in aviation re-financing.  How did that happen?  We do not build aircraft or have the population to generate that sort of activity but someone somewhere got that expertise together, innovated and evolved.  That is another niche area in which Ireland is successful.<\/p><p>We are a great people for attracting direct foreign investment.  I hear talk of reputational damage, and that we are corrupt.  Deputy Ross referenced the political cronies in the banks and so on but in terms of what went wrong in banking, it was stockbrokers, investment bankers and other professionals who made the mistakes.  In dealing with these issues we must learn from our mistakes.  We are making sure we regulate what we do here with this Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Bill.  We have to continue regulating because Ireland must protect its reputation, but there is not a requirement to regulate these vehicles in the way we have to regulate other companies.  It is an unnecessary cost and an unnecessary burden.  It may make people in opposition feel comfortable but it hinders our potential development.  We must remain innovative in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>What we are doing here will not be easy, and the Minister will have a lot of work to do.  The impression has been given that somehow we are competing with countries like Luxembourg.  We are not.  We are competing with the City of London.  Dublin and the International Financial Services Centre are minute in comparison to what the City of London is about.  In some respects we would be irrelevant to international finance if we disappeared in the morning because we are so small.  In comparison to what happens not just in the City of London but in New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and across the world, we have a very small share of the international financial services sector, regardless of what we might think.<br\/><br\/>There have been many attacks on us with regard to issues to do with our taxation.  I found it interesting that the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, criticised Ireland's taxation issues yet his Government is bringing out a corporation tax plan for 2015 to 2019, which is different from the one it brought out for 2011 to 2015.  He is bringing in changes to compete with us, some of which one could say directly contradict what he says at G20 meetings.  We need to position ourselves in terms of this debate, which is very much at international level, and we must be very careful in the way we move forward.  We do not need to kill off what is a vital part of our financial services sector.  At the same time it is a very small part and it could be easily damaged.  That is an important point.<br\/><br\/>The Minister will take this Bill to the finance committee where we will tease out many of the concerns raised about it by some people.  Other countries operate a very similar system.  The French operate the SICAV system.  The United Kingdom operates its own open-ended investment company, and many other jurisdictions have very similar legislation to the Bill before the House.  We are not doing anything particularly new.  We are adding another area to our financial services, and I hope we will get it right.  I hope that everybody here will go out and promote Ireland because we cannot compete with Wall Street.  If one travels to those jurisdictions one will see that the <i>Financial Times<\/i>or <i>The Wall Street Journal<\/i>promotes their own countries.  They will not promote Ireland on our behalf so we have to do that for ourselves.  We have huge advantages.  We have a sound legal system, which is very attractive to investors.  We are part of the eurozone.  We should emphasise more often that we are not just an economy of 5 million people but that as part of the eurozone we are part of a much wider economy of over 250 million, and that we can trade freely within the European Union.  We need to promote our fine attributes outside Europe and America in terms of being a country in which to do business and carry out financial services and banking transactions.<br\/><br\/>I wish the Minister of State the best of luck because he is also examining a new strategy for the Irish financial services industry and international banking.  It is recognised that we have a great future and that there are many opportunities for us in that regard.  We have built up a huge corporate memory over the course of the past 25 years in how to deal with international financial services.  Our civil servants have built up a huge amount of knowledge in terms of how to work this, which is very important.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's Luddite thinking was to the effect that we should all go back to making things, whatever that means, but the day of this country having major industries is gone.  We have to be sharper than that if we are to progress in the future.  It is important that we have opportunities in what we do well, and one of the things we do well is that we never fall behind.  Not only do we keep up with what everybody else is doing, we try to go beyond that and become even more innovative in how we make it work.  Nobody will ever go back to a situation where we would look for deregulation or some sort of free-for-all as happened in the past.<br\/><br\/>There have been changes in international finance.  Over the past decade some people who tried to make more money engaged in practices that were dangerous for international finance.  We should avoid that.  It most certainly is not a squeaky clean industry, no more than any system where people set out to make a profit and try to be different, but we must be very careful that we do not get involved in that, even if it may appear attractive at the outset.  We must be cautious in that regard but we have to plough on.  There is great scope in this area for Ireland, and we are in a pivotal position to make a difference with regard to this issue.<br\/><br\/>I wish the Minister the best of luck with this Bill and I hope we can discuss it further on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that much more legislation along these lines will be brought forward and discussed.  I have not seen anything in the Bill that we should be overly concerned about but I will listen to members' contributions in the finance committee debate.  The Bill will probably come to the finance committee relatively quickly and therefore we need to make sure we have an opportunity to discuss those concerns with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900031#DD00200","speaker":"1095","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412860500,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to give a cascade of welcome to both the Minister of State in his new position and on his first Bill, and also to the incoming chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Twomey, who was elected the other day, a committee which I feel very saddened I was expelled from by the Government, along with my membership of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, a year ago as a result of voting in according with conscience.<\/p><p>  I am glad to be able to offer a preliminary contribution on this Bill.  I was very interested to hear the opening statement of the Minister and the observations of Deputy McGrath, and those of Deputies Boyd Barrett and Ross.  It was an interesting melange of initial response, and all of it had validity.<\/p><p>I am reading a book, <i>Stress Test<\/i>, by Timothy F. Geithner, former president of the Federal Reserve and of the Federal Bank of New York, which came out recently.  It would be well worth the while of anyone who wants to contribute to this debate to read it because it shows, even with cutting edge experience and qualification and high head count resources in the Federal Reserve, supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, which looks after the Wall Street end of things, while the Federal Reserve looks after the licensed deposit, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, banks in America, how far behind the curve even the best operated regulators and central bankers found themselves when the crisis began to crack in America.  It was not a once-off explosion like a volcano.  There were splutterings at first.  Bear Stearns went.  The type of leveraged instruments and assets that had been created in the preceding years were very badly understood by everyone, even the most sophisticated.  Geithner had hands-on experience on site in the Asian crisis and the previous crises.  This thing was unravelling faster than they could understand it.  By a fluke they had just about got a handle on the tri-party obligation transactions approximately a year and a half before the uncontrollable crisis started to occur.<br\/><br\/>The danger, and I say this with all due respect, is that the introduction to this Bill sounds impressive.  It is jargonised and full of technospeak.  All these things in new instruments, new ways of doing business in mobile capital, exposures, liabilities and insurance products, because that is what they are, are hugely leveraged and built sometimes on the slimmest of margins.  We call this Bill the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Bill 2014, but it is not all about Irish collective asset-management vehicles.  It covers international collective asset-management vehicles registered in Ireland.  Let us correct that first.  Let us strip them all back to find out what is behind the facades.  What do their businesses do?  Whose money is under investment?  Where are the destination investments held?  If we are the location for the management, whether back office management or decision-making management, with contractual party positions being taken up, we may be assuming, if we put it under the umbrella of an Irish Central Bank review or regulation, professional indemnity exposures to this country.<br\/><br\/>Our Central Bank is still wobbling from lack of resources, experience, qualification, involvement and meaningful conversation with the institutions it supposedly regulates.  As regards the mortgage crisis, which is bread and butter stuff, it does not have a clue what is going on in the banks.  It trots out aggregate figures for arrears reported by the banks, but no one is drilling down into what exactly is going on.  No one has asked for a sample of 100 cases to be explained at bone marrow level.  Jargon is a great veil to hide behind.  There is too much opaque glass, too many veils hiding the realities and the nuts and bolts of what is going on.  We should be getting into the engine rooms.<br\/><br\/>I speak from experience.  Does anyone remember what a CDO is?  The Minister of State probably remembers the SIV, special investment vehicle.  A CDO is a collateralised debt obligation.  These companies proliferated at the IFSC theoretically to improve the cost of capital of international banks that were already highly leveraged.  The transactions that took place on the commercial paper issued in America, in dollar terms, to finance banks that had European balance sheets, when everything started to seize up and credit contracted from the over-leveraged positions of many banks, became a not very pretty sight.  Who is behind the drafting of this legislation is a very good question.  IFSC clearing house members are people of whom to be very wary.  I am not saying they are untrustworthy but the Minister of State should cross-examine them.  He should get down to nuts and bolts and quantify everything.  He should not be afraid to ask the questions.<br\/><br\/>Tim Geithner admits in his book that they did not know what was going on.  They had to get special teams to start beginning to learn what was going on.  Bear Stearns was rescued in a breathless state of misunderstanding by a bank which equally did not know where it stood.  Lehman Brothers did not have a clue.  These were the investment banks with undoubted reputations.  We vaunt our reputation.  We talk about it and massage it.  When one has to talk about one&rsquo;s reputation, it is already gone.  A banker said that and he was right.  When one has to protest that one is safe, one is not safe.<br\/><br\/>This Bill will need a great deal of close interrogation and examination on the next Stage.  We will not gloss over it because the cost will be too high if everything starts going wrong.  We will be the platform for approximately &euro;4.5 trillion of funds.  Do we know what proportion of those funds will be leveraged?  People think when they talk about an investment that it is saved up money invested in the product destination of the investment.  It is not.  Usually it is leveraged.  Even the Federal Reserve is leveraged 77:1.  The normal leveraging level of the Fed was approximately 20:1.  Deutsche Bank is over 50:1, Lehman was 40:1 when it went bust.  Lloyds reinsurance and insurance market almost went into meltdown from the stage when its reputation to that point had been undoubted, where people made presumptions and talked in the jargon of admiration.<\/p><p>We hear names like PwC, KPMG and Ernst &amp;amp; Young being trotted out with the suggestion that they make favourable observations and comments about the establishment of this type of arrangement.  We should not forget certain facts in this context.  KPMG acted for ten years or more as the auditor of Irish Nationwide, which blew losses of &euro;5.5 billion onto the households of the Irish people.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young acted as the auditor of Anglo Irish Bank, which blew losses of &euro;32 billion onto Irish citizens.  Anglo is still there, by the way.  People think it has gone away, more or less, because of the promissory notes and bonds and it is all brilliant.  It has not gone away.  If any of those bonds are sold, we will be really on the hook because we will not be able to cancel them at that point.  It is like the bar of the cross on the Irish people.  The Government should cancel them because it was wrong to place such a level of losses on the Irish people.  This is an example of a serious international financial service that the Government could do for the people of Ireland.  It would enable water charges to be removed until a proper system of water infrastructure funding, investment and delivery is put in place.  The same thing applies to the property taxes.  Those taxes are income taxes by another name.  They have to be paid out of income.<br\/><br\/>So far, corporates have been relieved of having to make any contribution to the national recovery.  The effective corporate tax rate for multinational corporations is approximately 6.5%.  As the Minister of State will recall, I said from the outset at parliamentary party meetings that a corporate contribution should be made in the form of a national recovery levy.  The Government was well able to get hundreds of millions of euro by robbing pension funds at levels like 0.6% and 0.75%.  It will get &euro;750 million from pension funds this year.  It is afraid to ask multinational corporations to contribute 3% of their reported profits - the profits they declare in their stateless existence - to a national recovery levy for three years.  It is not right that these corporates hover over jurisdictions in which they pay no taxes until they decide where they would like to pay them and subsequently pay a very small amount of tax.  It is a fact that taxes can only be paid from the incomes of individuals or corporates.  The only exception to this is when, on the transfer of the realised difference in the cost of the investment to the point of sale, there is an actual profit cash uplift and a little bit of that is paid as capital gains tax.  Otherwise, when people are being asked to pay money - one can call it a property tax, a water charge or whatever else one likes - it has to come out of their incomes.  In effect and in reality, it is substantively an income tax.  In the few remaining days before the budget, I ask the Minister of State to get the word back to the big man that he can do it if he applies some courage to a proper substantive understanding of what is going on.<br\/><br\/>Does the Minister of State know how many homeless people were asleep on Grafton Street yesterday morning?  When I spoke to Michael, who sells newspapers and magazines like <i>The Phoenix<\/i>from a mobile stand at the junction of Johnson's Court and Grafton Street, he told me that when he was going to work with his newspapers early yesterday, he counted 40 human souls - people without homes - sleeping rough on Grafton Street.  That is how all the losses and graphs, ups and downs, and pluses and minuses of the economy translate into human lives in our society.  There is merit in people with higher levels of income having to pay a little extra until we steer around the ship.  Approximately &euro;500 million of necessary funding and expenses needs to be given to the health service to correct the ship.  In real terms, this involves people waiting for operations and MRI scans etc.  Does the Minister of State know that people with serious symptoms in their heads or brains have to wait two years for MRI scans in the public health system?  That is how long one has to spend on the waiting list if one does not have private health insurance.  There is no need for that in our society.  It would amaze me if the CEOs, CFOs and COOs of foreign multinationals that have invested in Ireland were not able to advocate for the rightness and justification of taking on board an annual 3% levy on reported profits for three years as part of this country's national recovery effort.  I am absolutely certain of it.  I have asked many of them.  Some of them are my contemporaries.  They would not blink.  It is a shame that the conservative establishment is frightened of its own shadow at times.<br\/><br\/>I would like to add a few thoughts to my brief remarks about the potential for professional indemnity exposure if we get the management of this arrangement wrong and funds start to sue us because our regulator was remiss or the on-site management went astray.  The combined fines, penalties and settlements paid last year by two banks based in the US - Citigroup and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch - amounted to approximately $110 billion.  Fines, penalties and settlements arise from bad operations, misbehaviour or rule-breaking.  Citigroup has a reddened face in many of the parts of the world in which it has operated.  Tim Geithner talks about this in his book.  We should not be Pied-Pipered into something by buzzwords, jargon and technospeak.  We should be able to ensure all of this is explained exactly.  At the end of the day, it is all simple.  People swoon over the sub-prime slicing and dicing of mortgages when it is referred to as securitisation.  Even at home, on the familiar forecourt, people say &quot;do not talk to me about car engines&quot;.  They think it is a matter for an engineer to lift the bonnet.  It is not rocket science.  If one takes it simply, there is an engine with cylinders, which are spaces in which pistons go up and down.  When petrol is injected and ignited, it explodes and moves the pistons, which in turn drive the rods that drive the shafts that drive the wheels.  Finance is the same, but we do not ask enough questions.  That is why we got into the mess we have experienced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900032#EE00200","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412861700,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I begin by agreeing with Deputy Mathews that we often fail to ask enough questions.

I am here now to respond to some of the issues that were raised.  It is great to see such a great turnout.  This legislation does matter.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that it is serious stuff.  We are talking about a sector that employs many people.  Deputy Mathews is right when he says these regimes should not be overly complicated.  We should scrutinise them and tear them down.

Given that Deputy Mathews had 20 minutes, I ask him to give me a moment.  We need to make it clear that it is fine for the Government and the public sector to consult.  In my view, it is perfectly appropriate to have consultative forums in place.  That is what the Clearing House Group is.<\/p><p>However, it is on the floors of this and the Upper House and in the committee rooms that we make decisions.  The Clearing House Group comprises industry stakeholders who meet stakeholders from the public sector and discuss what we need to do to have a robust and competitive financial services sector, but it is us, as the people's elected representatives, who make the decisions.  That is the purpose of the legislative process.  Let us not try to create conspiracy theories.  This legislation has been steered by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and in close contact with the Central Bank.<\/p><p> A theme of this debate has been that we have much to learn from the regulatory mistakes of the past so as to ensure that they do not recur.  I will endeavour to address as many of the issues raised as I can, but I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We had a constructive engagement in which an interesting array of points were made.  Some were reasonable and some were not.  I am looking forward to a more detailed consideration of the provisions on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> I will begin with some of Deputy Michael McGrath's comments.  He declared his support for the legislation, for which I am grateful.  He was correct, in that we have been through serious &quot;financial storms&quot; in recent years.  The financial services sector is fast moving and, in his words, we all need to raise our game - the Government, the Oireachtas, industry and public bodies.  I was appointed by the Taoiseach to be the first Minister of State with responsibility for the financial services sector in almost 20 years because political oversight and leadership was necessary.  As such, we are preparing a new, action-based financial services strategy that will be published early next year.  I would welcome submissions from Deputies on all sides of the House as to how Ireland should be positioned to ensure that we continue selling our country as a great location for international banking while creating jobs and investment.<\/p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty raised the question of AGMs not being held under the provisions of this legislation.  While directors can decide not to hold an AGM, members holding 10% of shares can demand that one be held.  It should also be remembered that the investors will have daily access to the net asset value of the scheme.  As such, they are in a different position from the shareholders of trading companies.<\/p><p> The Deputy also stated that we needed further answers about the proposed transfer of some elements of the Companies Registration Office, CRO, to the Central Bank.  That is a reasonable proposition and I will happily address it with him and others on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Deputies Michael McGrath, Boyd Barrett, Ross and Mathews raised concerns about regulation.  All Irish collective asset management vehicles, ICAVs, will be subject to regulation by the Central Bank.  We have already discussed the various relevant European directives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900034#GG00400","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412862300,"counter":428,"content":"<p>That is the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900035#HH00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1412862300,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Deputy Mathews made reasonable points about skill sets and resourcing, but this Bill is not about deregulation, which was Deputy Ross's allusion.  Rather, the Bill is about asking whether we have the correct structure in place, should we view funds in the same way as stereotypical companies, should we examine what competitor countries are doing or should we stay as we are.  This is the debate.  In this Bill, I am proposing that we consider installing a new structure, the ICAV.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about the Bill's origin, which I have already addressed.  A range of stakeholders were involved in the Bill's gestation, including the funds industry, its advisers and the public service, but it was driven by the Department of Finance in close consultation with the Central Bank and my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett discussed a range of topics.  He would accept that we come at this issue from different ideological points of view.  We live in a global economy and funds are already based in this country.  Deputies could do worse than to visit some of the funds to speak with the Irish men and women, who are young in many cases, working in that industry.  They are not bad people working in a bad industry.  They are honest, honourable, well qualified and skilled people from this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900035#HH00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1412862300,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Their bosses are the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900035#HH00400","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1412862300,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Deputy Mathews might have an issue with their bosses, but these employees are not faceless people.

Let us acknowledge this fact.  While mistakes have been made in the industry, many mistakes have also been made in this House.  It does not mean that everyone in the House is a bad or incompetent person.

I suggest that he read it in advance of Committee Stage and have an exchange with us then.  Some 64 sections give rise to an offence.<\/p><p>  As to the question of tax advantages for investors in ICAVs, it is important to reiterate that, while investors in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, or alternative investment fund structures like ICAVs may be able to avail of the US check-the-box tax treatment, which is already available to unit trusts, common contractual funds and investment limited partnerships, the tax treatment of any fund structure is a matter for each jurisdiction where the liability arises and such &quot;look through&quot; vehicles have long been available to fund promoters in Ireland and across Europe.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked whether we were simply introducing this legislation to compete with Luxembourg.  My colleague, Deputy Twomey, alluded to this matter.  Luxembourg has a similar vehicle, but so does Italy, Spain, France, the UK, Germany and the USA.  Deputy Michael McGrath summed up the situation well, in that the House needs to make a collective effort - that is the Government's wish - so that our structures can &quot;catch up&quot; and be fit for purpose.  Let us make the jobs of the people who are travelling the world promoting Ireland as a location for employment and investment easier by ensuring that the structures we have in place are like those used by our competitors.  If we do not do so, we will get left behind.<\/p><p>  I want to answer as many questions as possible.  The ICAV Bill should not be seen in isolation as a technical exercise to make the lives of fund managers or their accountants or lawyers easier.  The legislation's intention is to bring Ireland to a point where we can compete on an even footing with other European fund domiciles.  We should not cede ground to our competitors when it could mean the loss of investment.  I did not get appointed as the Minister of State with responsibility for international banking and the IFSC to cede ground.  I have been appointed to provide political oversight, bring the public sector together and ensure that we have fit-for-purpose structures and innovative products and that we are ready to compete for more jobs and investment.  While one cannot be certain as to the precise number of new jobs that will result from the availability of the ICAV structure, past evidence suggests that industry makes use of whatever vehicles are available.  The fact that we will not need to apply unnecessary company law requirements arising from EU obligations to ICAVs will be a bonus.<\/p><p>  As drafted, the Bill cross-applies a number of provisions of the Companies Act.  On further reflection, it may be desirable to set out some of these regimes in a more extensive form.  I expect to conclude my consideration of where this might be most appropriate in the near future.  If necessary, I will table proposals on Committee Stage in this regard and consider amendments from colleagues on all sides.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ross admitted that he sometimes got things wrong.  He got some things wrong today.  It is wrong to name in the House an individual or series of individuals, apply derogatory terms like &quot;cronies&quot; and &quot;stooges&quot; and imply that having political affiliations or being involved in political life somehow makes someone a bad person or debars one from contributing to State agencies.  I heard him make the same comment in respect of the Garda, the Judiciary and State boards.  We need transparent procedures for appointments to State boards.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, outlined reforms on behalf of the Government this week.  My party has made mistakes, but I would suggest that every party and Independent in the House has done so.  We must put reforms and mechanisms in place.  In doing so, however, let us not suggest unfairly that everyone who serves on a board or has been appointed to a Garda or judicial position is somehow unable.  The sort of commentary in which someone shouts, roars and makes wild statements before leaving the House without listening to my response, which was requested, is unhelpful.  We need to reform the system.  Deputy Ross has previously suggested various individuals for senior appointments to banking positions.<\/p><p>Were I to name those individuals, which I will not, I might even make him blush.  Consequently, Members should not try to be whiter than white here.  Members should look at the system and together should introduce the reforms.<\/p><p> I will conclude on this point but there was also a comment on the broader, global taxation issues.  While this issue is not directly related to this Bill, it is fair that it is brought up in the context of international banking.  Again, however, one should not pretend that nothing is happening in this regard.  An OECD discussion is under way, as is the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process and the Department of Finance has opened this process to public consultation and submissions were received.  Moreover, the first series of reports are available.  It is fair to state that Ireland, as a small open economy with a small population, must move in line with our international partners.  We need global action on this issue as it is a global matter.  This is not to state - I see Deputy Mathews appears animated - there are not measures the Government could take and may take and obviously, there will be a budget next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900035#HH00700","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412862900,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Boring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900036#JJ00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1412862900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>However, the ESRI this week has produced an interesting report on the issue of corporation tax.

One issue that affects women in particular - even though it is not against them, that is just the way it happens - concerns those who take career breaks to look after and care for their children.  When they return to work some years later, they find there is an issue regarding the PRSI contributions they have paid.  This is because of the way in which the contributory pension works at present, which is that it goes from the day on which one started work and is averaged out over the number of years one has worked right up to the point at which one retires.  If one takes 20 years out during the intervening period when no contribution is paid, it means one's contributory pension is affected, whereas if one only started work at 50 or 55 and worked for ten years, one would get one's full contributory pension without having worked for 30 or 40 years.<\/p><p>  This has really affected women, especially from a historical point of view because back in the 1970s, women were forced to give up work in the public service when they got married.  At that stage, women once married had to resign from their positions.  As the ban ended in 1973, women in this position were able once again to make up contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, which would eventually award them a contributory pension.  In such a scenario, these women were able to make up for lost contributions when they retired.  However, new regulations were introduced in 2012 by the Department of Social Protection.  This new system aligned pension contributions with the average number of weeks worked.  This charge affected up to 50,000 people at the time, mostly women.  In certain cases, this means that women who spent a substantial part of their lives working and paying contributions would have been better off had they not worked at all and simply claimed the non-contributory pension.  This contradicts two basic principles to which the Government has committed, namely, removing obstacles that might prevent women returning to work and, second, the commitment not to do anything that would reduce basic social welfare payments.<\/p><p>  This also raises another question which is dealt with under the scope section of the Department of Social Protection.  The employment status group was set up under the programme for prosperity and fairness.  This group was set up due to growing concern that an increasing number of individuals were categorised as self-employed when the indicators were that employee status would have been more appropriate.  While this area is very complex, certain outcomes have rightly and justifiable been arrived at where a partner, usually a women, who worked all his or her life on the family farm or in a family business without a separate income has been deemed eligible to share in his or her partner's PRSI contributions, therefore allowing him or her to qualify for a full contributory pension.  In this case, one must apply to the scope section and a substantial payment of up to &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 often is required, which also is a concern for people.  This is because in most cases, income was assessed on the husband's income, whereas PRSI contributions are assessed individually.  Therefore, if one does not have the contributions, one is not entitled to one's contributory pension.  It is then difficult to understand why women or partners who stays at home to care for children, an act which allows their spouses to continue working, should not also benefit from a share of their partners' PRSI contributions during this period of their lives.  This can also apply to men, as the world changes and increasing numbers of men remain at home.  Were a system like this in place, the averaging system introduced in 2012 would not discriminate against women who broke their employment record merely to facilitate the family and society as a whole.  If such a system cannot not be universally introduced at present, the least the Minister and the Government could do is to revert to the older system where people in this position were allowed to make up for lost contributions when they retire.<\/p><p>  This is a major issue as far as women are concerned.  It is now adversely affecting older women who were banned from working because they decided to get married and a marriage ban was in place if one worked in the public service.  It also affects mainly lower-paid women who now are retiring and who had worked on and off in the private sector over the years.  I hope the Minister will give due consideration to this complex issue in the context of upcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900036#JJ01700","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1412862900,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900036#JJ01800","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1412862900,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The priority of the Government since entering office has been to maintain fully the core weekly rates of payment for pensioners and it has done that successfully over the past three budgets.  The Irish pensions system is made up of a number of schemes, based on a number of criteria such as contributions paid, income need and other factors.  These ensure that people have an adequate income when they retire.  The range of supports has resulted in similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland.  Poverty rates for women and men over 65 have been, in statistically-significant terms, the same over a number of years despite many women having lower earnings than men during their working lives.  It should also be noted that the consistent poverty rate for those over 65 is approximately one third of that for those aged between 18 and 64 and roughly a quarter of the rate for those aged 17 and under.<\/p><p>  The State contributory pension is one of a number of schemes and the pension is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce and who have paid more into that fund are more likely to be paid under this scheme.  The home-maker's scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for the contributory State pension easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent looking after children under 12 years or people with a caring need, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, it is important to note that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied.  For those who do not satisfy these conditions, a means-tested State pension may be available.<\/p><p>Costs in regard to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to backdate this scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;160 million.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p> In regard to women and social insurance payments, it is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the fund.\u00a0 The review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.\u00a0 The review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p><p> The Deputy has raised an important issue which we need to examine.

This is a complex issue.  It often only comes to light when people approach retirement age and it may be difficult for them to check back on their contributions during their working life.  We need to deal with the issue in terms of the women who were forced to give up work when the marriage ban was in place as many of those women have reached retirement age.  We need to make the process simple and to give people choices.  It does not seem fair that the pension contributions of a person who began work at the age of 20, continued working until the age of 32 or 33 and then took a break of 15 or 20 years, are averaged out over the whole of their working life.  I appreciate the point the Minister of State made about the scheme allowing for a provision up to 20 years in that respect.  If a person only began work at the age of 55, he or she would qualify for a contributory pension on retirement at the age of 65 or 66.

I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance for being present to reply to this matter and I wish him well in his new role.<\/p><p>  There is an urgent need to introduce a cap on the interest rates that can be charged by moneylenders.  They are regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  I have concerns that not enough is being done to ensure that moneylenders charge their customers a fair interest rate.  The Central Bank renews licences for moneylenders on a year basis.  It can refuse to grant a licence where it deems the cost of interest to be charged is too high and unfair to the customer, yet there are instances where it is renewing moneylenders' licences where some moneylenders are charging up to 188%, and even more in some cases, in interest rates.  <\/p><p>  There are 43 moneylenders licensed to operate in Ireland with the majority being small to medium enterprises.  There has been an increase in the number of customers who have turned moneylenders with the number increasing by 60,000 in recent years.  Obviously that is due to the economic situation.  Also, many low income earners have turned to moneylenders because they have been refused credit by the credit unions and the banks.  That is an issue that the Minister needs to examine further.<\/p><p>  I have concerns that people are not aware of the loan amounts, interest amounts and profits that have been accrued in some of the deals entered into.  More transparency and accountability need to be introduced.  With his banking background, Deputy Mathews will appreciate that schedules need to be introduced that would set out the capital amount, the amount of interest and projected payments once payments of a fixed amount are being made on loans.  The imposition of a high interest rate limit could impact on the moneylending sector and make it unviable for some operators and people may turn to illegal moneylenders whose operations are unregulated which would be even worse.  Nobody would want that to happen.<\/p><p>  In that regard, a cap on interest rates is what is needed.  The Minister would have to be careful as to the ceiling he would set for the highest level of interest moneylenders could charge.  For example, a person who takes out a loan of &euro;100 and pays &euro;58 in interest on top of the loan of &euro;100 is paying a considerable level of interest.  The Central Bank is allowing that to happen at present.<\/p><p>  I ask that an interest rate ceiling of 50% be set which would be greatly beneficial to many customers who use moneylenders.  I ask the Minister to consider that proposal.  Some 13 members of the European Union have already introduced legal caps on licensed moneylenders with Spain enforcing a 10% APR cap, Belgium a 19.5% cap and France a 21.6% cap.  Also the UK is considering introducing legislation in this area with a maximum interest rate of 100% APR for short-term lending.  Will the Minister look to what is happening in the rest of Europe and introduce some level of a higher limit of interest rate that can be charged in these instances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900037#KK00500","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1412863500,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for giving me an opportunity to outline the Government's thinking it.  I will deal with some of his requests which were quite constructive at the end of my response.<\/p><p>  The Government has some concerns about the introduction of a cap.  Those concerns include that the introduction of a cap on the interest rates that can be charged by moneylenders would not necessarily be in the interests of consumers or the wider financial system.  The Central Bank is the competent authority, as the Deputy outlined, with regard to licensed moneylending and is responsible for overseeing and regulating their activity.  Legislative provisions relating to moneylending are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended.  It is an offence under that Act to engage in the business of moneylending without a licence granted by the Central Bank.  I understand that there are 39 licensed moneylenders operating in Ireland at present.<\/p><p>  The legislation does not provide for an interest rate cap for moneylenders.  The introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit, for example, if the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve but I pose the concerns that we have that it may not have the desirable effect.<\/p><p>  Lower interest rate ceilings could also result in excluding low income households from access to credit that have repayment capacity, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.<\/p><p>The Government would have some concerns, therefore, about the imposition of an industry-wide interest rate cap without a detailed assessment of its impact on consumers.  Often the loans are for small amounts, are needed immediately by the customers and are made available and repaid at the home of the customer.  The shorter the duration of the loan, for example, two weeks, the higher the annual percentage rate of charge, APRC, as the APRC is an annualised measure of the interest charged.  This service may impose extra costs on the moneylenders.  Under section 47 of the Consumer Credit Act, a customer may apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration that the total cost of the credit provided is excessive.<br\/><br\/>Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank on an annual basis to have their licences granted or renewed.  Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, sets out the Central Bank's powers, duties and responsibilities regarding the granting or refusal of a moneylender's licence and in the regulation when granted.  In addition to the licensing system, the Central Bank has in place a Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders.  The Central Bank has power to impose sanctions on licensed moneylenders for a contravention of the code.  Since 1 December 2011, licensed moneylenders have been subject to a new fitness and probity regime by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has advised me that there is a rigorous process involved in the granting or renewal of a licence.<br\/><br\/>Under section 93(10)(<i>g<\/i>) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, the Central Bank can refuse to grant a moneylender's licence on a number of grounds.  One of these grounds is where, in the Central Bank's opinion, the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  This point is particularly relevant to this Topical Issue debate.  Although there is no specific cap on the interest rate which a moneylender may charge, the licence granted to the moneylender will indicate what the APRC is and all advertisements must include the following words in font larger than the rest of the advertisement: &quot;WARNING: This is a high cost loan.&quot;<br\/><br\/>There is a danger that if a cap on interest rates were introduced, some licensed moneylenders might exit the market with the ensuing risk that illegal operators might take their place.  We are all aware of the operation of illegal operators and the negative impact they can have on families and communities.  Since persons operating as illegal moneylenders are in breach of the law, it is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate their activities.  Under section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has sole responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of such offences.<br\/><br\/>I would encourage consumers to consider all the different sources of loans that are available to them.  Deputy Terence Flanagan highlighted the problem of moneylenders becoming so prevalent as a consequence of the economic crisis the country has come through.  I encourage people to avail of the personal finance information available from the National Consumer Agency.  This information can be found on the website <i>www.itsyourmoney.ie<\/i>.  In addition to the information provided on this website, people who are in debt or in danger of getting into debt may avail of the services of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  As the Deputy knows, MABS works with people in order to assist them with financial planning and budgeting for the future.  It is a national, free, confidential and independent service.  The Deputy's point about the need to examine what happens in other European countries and best practice in Europe is something I am happy to take back to the Minister for Finance and I will ensure he receives it directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900037#KK00600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412864100,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's last comment in particular.  He has a can-do attitude and, hopefully, he will re-examine the fact that 13 EU countries, including Spain, Belgium and France, are adopting a legal cap on licensed moneylenders.  Even the UK is considering it.  We are talking about low-income families who are being refused credit by banks and credit unions and have nobody else to turn to.  Perhaps the Minister of State could consider allowing credit unions to apply a risk-based price structure to their loans and charge a higher rate for higher-risk loans.  Credit unions could have more of a role to play in these particular instances and provide help for families in extreme difficulty and in poverty.  Perhaps this could be considered as part of the ongoing debate about credit unions and what they could and should do in the future.<\/p><p>  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has highlighted the issue of illegal moneylenders and warned the Government that urgent action must be taken to stop vulnerable families being targeted.  Some of them are being charged 400% per quarter for short-term loans, which the Minister will agree is horrendous.  Families are turning to these illegal moneylenders particularly when they are preparing their children for going back to school and at Christmas time.

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the decision by the European Commission to give approval to the proposed &pound;24.5 billion or &euro;31.2 billion nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset.  There has been no nuclear power plant construction in the UK in the past 20 years and there has been a very substantial emphasis on renewable energy for a considerable period of time, with Ireland hoping to become a net provider of energy to the UK in the not too distant future and Germany turning its back on nuclear energy.  Therefore, the announcement by the European Commission that the UK, in its proposal for a very expensive power station in Somerset, 240 km from Ireland, should be allowed to receive state subsidy for its construction and operation came as a surprise to everybody.<\/p><p>  Given that it is very difficult to see how this could be other than contrary to the anti-competition laws, I call on the Government to join Austria in the legal action it proposes against the proposed nuclear power station.  There are major environmental concerns regarding the impact of the power plant in relation to the state aid.  The Austrian Government's legal action in the European Court of Justice is very specifically on the state subsidy element.  The problem is that if the European Commission does not regard a state subsidy as anti-competitive, we could have a new generation of heavily subsidised nuclear power plants across Europe.  This plant will provide approximately 7% of the UK's energy requirements and could spark a very large number of similar nuclear power projects and shift the dynamic from renewable energy to nuclear energy.<\/p><p> The power plant will use the unproven EPR technology, which is not operational anywhere in the world, even though France and China are beginning to look at construction there.  Nevertheless, it is unproven at this point in time.  After all these decades, there is still no satisfactory method for dealing with the considerable quantities of radioactive waste the plant will generate over its lifetime of 60 years.<\/p><p> Under the plan, the British Government would be allowed offer EDF Energy, the company behind the project, a guaranteed power price of &pound;92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years - more than 50% of the lifespan of the plant.  This is more than twice the current market rate.  Clearly, this represents subsidisation of an operational plant.<\/p><p> EDF Energy will also benefit from a state guarantee covering any debt which the operator will seek to obtain on financial markets to fund the construction of the plant.  The new Hinkley Point nuclear power station will require debt financing of &pound;17 billion and will eventually have a capital outlay of approximately &pound;34 billion.  These are massive sums.<\/p><p> Rather than these significant subsidies for nuclear energy, it would seem far more appropriate to support alternative renewable energy sources, which are still grossly underfunded throughout Europe.  The scale of the subsidy being given to EDF Energy is significant and it is difficult to understand how such extensive support cannot be considered an illegal state subsidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900038#LL00600","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412864700,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Costello for raising this important issue.

During the investigation, the United Kingdom agreed to modify the terms of the project financing significantly.  As a result, the Commission indicates that it has decided that the state aid provided will remain proportionate to the objective pursued, avoiding any undue distortions of competition in the Single Market.<\/p><p>  The United Kingdom Government published its draft energy national policy statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged by it as potentially suitable.

The first of these plants is planned for construction at Hinkley Point in Somerset, on the south-west coast of England.<\/p><p>  It is Ireland's position that, where another state chooses either to develop a nuclear power industry or expand its existing nuclear power industry, this must always be done in accordance with the highest international standards on safety and environmental protection.  Ireland's priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been recognised by the United Kingdom as a stakeholder in any consultation involving a nuclear development proposal.  When the United Kingdom decided to embark on plans to build a new fleet of nuclear power stations, Ireland was one of the stakeholders involved as part of the national policy statement consultation.<\/p><p>  Since the original announcement in 2009 of plans to build a new fleet of nuclear power stations, Ireland has written at ministerial level to the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Edward Davey MP, outlining concerns about the potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea.  The key issues of concern include the assessments by the United Kingdom of effects on the environment, the management of radioactive waste and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities.  This engagement has been supported by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage with relevant United Kingdom officials on a wide range of nuclear related matters.<\/p><p>  It is the United Kingdom's position that Hinkley Point will have no transboundary effects during routine operations.  Under the EURATOM treaty, the United Kingdom was required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley Point would not result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  In that context, a Commission opinion, issued in February 2012, considered that in normal operating conditions, discharges of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents were not likely to result in exposure of the population of another member state, which is significant from the point of view of health.<\/p><p>  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, which is now incorporated in to the Environmental Protection Agency, was asked by Government to prepare a report on the potential radiological implications for Ireland from the proposed new nuclear power plants in the United Kingdom, including Hinkley Point.  This report, published on 20 May 2013, concluded that the threat to human health from this new building programme is very low.  The report shows that any radioactive contamination in the air, either from day-to-day operation of the proposed nuclear power plants or accidental releases, would be transported away from Ireland most of the time.  This conclusion arises from an analysis of weather conditions prevailing in Ireland and the United Kingdom over the past 21 years.  The RPII report also shows that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants will have no measurable radiological impact on Ireland or on the Irish marine environment.  In the highly unlikely event of a severe accident occurring at one of the plants, combined with unfavourable atypical weather conditions prevailing at the time, the report finds that some food controls and agricultural protective actions would be necessary in Ireland for a period.<\/p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to utilise fully existing channels of communication with the United Kingdom authorities to ensure they are fully aware of any concerns that Ireland has in relation to their proposed nuclear new-build programme.<\/p><p>  While the Commission announced its state aid decision yesterday, the decision itself has not yet been published.  We will be reviewing it carefully as soon as it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900039#MM00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412864700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  He did not indicate whether or not Ireland will consider joining Austria in the legal action in which it has decided to engage, even though there has not been full publication of the decision.<\/p><p>  There are the obvious environmental dangers that I mentioned.  We have had difficulties in recent times with Chernobyl and Fukushima that arose from man-made and natural disasters.  Apart from that, if state subsidisation is allowed for a particular form of energy production, where does that leave the other energy production modes?  In renewable energy, on which we have European Union targets to meet, anti-competition laws seem to apply fully, but because this is such a major project, it is allowed to get subsidies, both in terms of the capital funding for its structure and in terms of the cost ratio for its current operations.  Both of those seem questionable in terms of EU policy and I understand that is the basis on which Austria is taking the case.  From the point of view of best practice and statutory provisions, even though the Commission has made its decision, would it not be appropriate that we should also have recourse to the European Court of Justice to determine whether anti-competition mechanisms are in operation in this case?<\/p><p>  We have considerable agricultural capacity here in Ireland.  We are building that for the future and expanding to a significant degree.  As well as the threat to the people of Ireland, and there is always the danger of a serious threat despite what is said about the prevailing winds likely to be going in the opposite direction, we were affected to a considerable degree when Chernobyl exploded and we could not sell Irish lamb from various areas for a period.  Chernobyl is a long distance from Ireland.<\/p><p>  All the issues would indicate that it would be well in our interests to ensure we are involved at the highest level in this decision-making process in the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900039#MM00300","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1412864700,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I reiterate that while the decision has been announced, it has not yet been published.

Last month, 2,000 people were on the waiting list.  Since July the time spent on the waiting list has increased from three months to four months.  The waiting list in July increased from 1,465 to 2,007 people.<\/p><p>  The situation has resulted in a dire situation for older people and their families.  The delays caused by the HSE while waiting for approval are costing people thousands of euro.  The cost is up to &euro;1,000 a week in some cases.  People are entitled to access care under the fair deal scheme but they find themselves trapped on the waiting list and forced to remain in hospital.  That has an obvious impact on hospitals in general, especially acute hospital beds, and there are associated costs to the State.  The other impact is on nursing homes and their ability to trade and provide a service.<\/p><p>  Once the scheme was provided to people, negotiation with nursing home owners was possible which allowed the scheme to be backdated, but that is no longer the case.  The cost associated with the delays are to the detriment of the applicants and their families.  Many of them simply cannot afford the situation.  Families cannot take advantage of an offer of a place within a nursing home close to them which might suit their needs and requirements as they cannot afford it.  If and when approval becomes available, three to four months later, there is no guarantee that the service within the facility to which they applied will still be available.<\/p><p>  It would be cheaper and more cost-effective for the State to address the deficiency of administrative staff.  I was told that &euro;23 million was diverted from the scheme to the community care package.  The situation of many of the people who made representations to me on the matter has deteriorated to such an extent that the time provided to them has been cut.  When they apply for home help for an hour a day, they are provided with only half an hour a day.  I do not see where the extra money that was taken away from the fair deal scheme is being provided.<\/p><p>  I urge the Minister to speak to his counterpart in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, about the schemes to assist the elderly and the disabled, for example, the home adaptation scheme which carries out necessary repairs to meet the needs of people within their homes to avoid them being a burden on the State.  Funding has dried up to such an extent in County Offaly that I am acting for 70 people who have been told by the local authority that, due to the lack of availability of funding, it cannot address the needs of those applicants.  In many cases people were told that it would be a further three to five years before the applications could be processed.  The average cost per applicant is approximately &euro;20,000.  The cost to the State of not providing the funding amounts to approximately &euro;18 million.  The figure is based on &euro;1,000 a week for five years to provide care in a nursing home setting, which the Government is forced to do in the absence of being unable to maintain people in their own home by virtue of the lack of funding which might have adapted their home to their needs.  The provision of &euro;1.4 million could alleviate the problem which would allow an overall saving of approximately &euro;16.5 million.<\/p><p>  I urge the Minister to make an effort to converse with his ministerial counterpart with a view to addressing the deficiency with a once-off payment which might meet the demand and reduce the burden on the fair deal scheme.  I corresponded with the Department and those responsible for improving the situation, but to date, unfortunately, that has been to no avail.  Has the Minister made any inroads in terms of his forthcoming budget or on impressing on the sector the need to be more efficient and to address the deficiencies?  The scheme was devised to assist people.  People should be allowed to be accountable in some shape or form for the service they receive.  That is not the case to any great extent currently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900040#NN00100","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1412865300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this important issue.  The nursing homes support scheme, a fair deal, is a system of financial support for individuals who require long-term nursing home care.  Anyone who is ordinarily resident in the State and who may need nursing home care, regardless of age, can apply for the scheme.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The total budget for long-term residential care in 2014 is &euro;939 million.  It should be pointed out that a number of people covered by funding arrangements which preceded the scheme are also funded from this provision.  The HSE releases funding weekly to balance activity across the full course of each year.  The HSE operates a national placement list to match the funding available at any given time to demand.  All applicants who are approved for funding are put on the placement list in order of their approval date.  Funding issues to applicants in a strict order to ensure equity nationally.  The current waiting time on the placement list is 15 weeks, with 2,114 people on the list awaiting release of funding.<br\/><br\/>In the first seven months of 2014, a total of 3,553 new clients were funded under the scheme.  The length of time an applicant remains on the placement list depends on the number of approved applicants awaiting funding for the scheme at any given time and the number of applicants receiving payment under the scheme.  This means the duration of time on the placement list can fluctuate.<br\/><br\/>While I would prefer if we had no need for waiting lists of this kind, significant funding pressures exist in the health service generally, and the nursing homes support scheme must operate within the funding available to it and manage that in the most effective way possible.  I must emphasise that while residential care is an important part of the supports in place for older people, Government policy is to enable as many older people as possible to remain in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Towards that end, funding for community services has been augmented by transferring &euro;23 million from the provision for residential care to enhance new and more intensive home supports for those with higher or more complex needs, as Deputy Cowen acknowledged.<br\/><br\/>The review of the nursing homes support scheme, which is under way, will consider the sustainability of the scheme itself, and will also consider the way in which we balance residential and community supports.  The needs of older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for the Government.  The resources that are available will continue to be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services in a way that most effectively matches the needs and preferences of older people themselves, with a particular focus on enabling people to live as independently as possible for as long as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900040#NN00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412865300,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response but he has merely restated what I said about the current situation.  It is another example of what the Minister might agree was a flawed health budget this year.

The Minister said it is the Government&rsquo;s prerogative to allow people to remain in their home for as long as possible.  That is most laudable and I support it wholeheartedly.  If the Minister meant what he said and if he wants it to carry any weight and show he can be different from the Ministers who have preceded him, he will acknowledge what I said.  For example, 70 people are waiting to have their homes adapted in order for them to stay at home and live longer in their homes.  The cost of that is approximately &euro;1.5 million.  The Minister is standing idly by while the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government allows a local authority to inform such people they will have to wait three years to five years before their applications can even be fully assessed.  The Minister must then carry the can.  If they were to apply for the fair deal scheme, the Minister would be obliged to pay &euro;18.5 million to provide care.  We all know the majority of the applicants would be in the cemetery before the five years is up.  Those are the facts of the matter.  That is the bottom line.  No amount of glossing over figures and saying the sum of &euro;23 million was diverted here, there or elsewhere will cover up what is happening.
