It highlights that a catch-up programme is urgently needed.  The figures show that fewer than 100,000 people have been screened through the State's three cancer screening programmes this year compared with five times that - half a million people - who were screened last year.  More than 450 cancers and 1,600 precancer diagnoses may have been missed this year, according to the Irish Cancer Society.  We understand that services have had to be curtailed due to Covid-19, but we need a catch-up programme and the Government must deal with that urgently.<\/p><p>Today, I raise a report published last week into gynaecology services in Letterkenny University Hospital.  The report was commissioned after a hard-fought battle by patients and their families who knew that there was something deeply wrong about the services in that hospital.  Hospital consultant, Dr. Margaret McMahon, who watched her sister die from endometrial cancer, was at the heart of this.  She contacted Saolta University Health Care group in Letterkenny and made it aware that she believed women's lives were at risk as a result of the practices in the hospital.  She knew from her sister's experience that it was a serious issue, but it fell on deaf ears.  She contacted the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in 2016 and relayed the same information to him.  Desperate, in 2017 she contacted him again and told him she would leave her consultancy practice in England and jump on a plane if he could give her five or ten minutes to explain to him why women's lives were being put at risk in Letterkenny University Hospital.  I understand that the Minister responded by giving her the address of the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>Margaret McMahon and other patients' families have been completely vindicated by the report that was published last week because it is clear that the situation in Letterkenny University Hospital did put women's lives at risk and women have lost their lives as a result of the practices there.  Of the 133 cases of endometrial cancer over a ten-year period, one in three women experienced a delay in their diagnosis, one in five women who had endometrial cancer suffered significant consequences as a result of a delay.  Ten of these women have passed away since, and a significant portion of those deaths is because of the delays and the service.  The report reveals a litany of failures which had devastating and life-changing consequences for these women.  At the time of the independent review, when Margaret was forced to go public and reach out to politicians like myself who raised these cases in the D&aacute;il, two women were waiting for urgent referral to that hospital for four years.  That is how bad the situation is.<\/p><p>I will put some of the findings on the record:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is clear that the experience for these women, and the service provided to them, was unsatisfactory.  All cases, in one form or another, are typified by delay &ndash; delay from an urgent GP referral to a gynaecology outpatient appointment; from gynaecology outpatient appointment to urgent diagnostics ... and-or from diagnostics to intervention. <\/blockquote>  <p>It says there were suboptimal practices with no evidence of implementation of recommendations that were previously given.  A significant amount of responsibility lay with the oncology liaison nurse who had no written description of her roles or responsibility.<\/p><p>Will the Minister ensure that each and every recommendation by the independent panel is reviewed?  Will he ensure that there is a proper review that goes wider than endometrial cancer in that hospital?  Will he consider the independent panel recommendation for a full audit to be carried out throughout the State to ensure that Letterkenny is not an outlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300003#A00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1599125400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Doherty for raising the case, representing the family in question, and trying to relieve some of their terrible loss by ensuring that if there are failings in our system, they do not go unchecked and are actually addressed.  I commit to following up with the Minister of Health to ensure that the report's findings are implemented.  Our cancer system has improved significantly in recent years - everyone would recognise that - but that is not to say there are not failings in the system.  A key issue we need to improve is the connection between the GP primary care system and our hospital system so that referrals happen in a seamless, quick, timely manner, which is one of the recommendations of that independent report.  While there have been improvements in our cancer treatment system, we cannot rest.  We must ensure that we press on and where there are failings in the system, be it in any one hospital or be it systematic, that we address them.  I will certainly follow up on that.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's first point, it is a valid point as well that we must ensure that, in managing our Covid system, we do not lose sight of other preventative measures that can save lives.  Critical to that is ensuring the return of cancer screening.  I understand that BreastCheck is due to return next month.  It cannot happen soon enough because we know that early intervention, particularly in cancer, and catching cancer cases early is critical to good outcomes, whether in cervical, breast, prostate or other cancers.  We will look at the report and I will make sure that the Department and the Minister for Health in particular comes back to the Deputy on the recommendations.

There seems to be a mindset within the Government that a second lockdown is inevitable.  Indeed, the Minister for Health said as much last week.  Increasingly, there is a sense among the public that they are forgoing so many different aspects of normal life while the business community is paying an enormous price, but the other key partner in all of this, the Government, is not playing its part.<\/p>  <p>  It is not playing its part in three key ways: the need to honour its commitment to ensure we have an effective testing and tracing system in place; to ensure we have proper controls at our airports and ports; and to ensure that open information and data are made available, and that they would drive the policy in this area.  None of those things are happening.  As for testing and tracing, from the beginning we have been told this must be about test, test, test, and we described our own early policy of being one of test, trace and isolate, but we are not doing that.  For so long we were playing catch-up while the numbers were growing earlier in the year.  Finally, when the numbers, thankfully, started to drop, we were told the capacity was there.  We are told the capacity is for 100,000 tests a week.  I do not believe that.  It has never been achieved or nearly achieved.  What is happening in that area?  We heard on the radio this morning that staff are being taken away from audiology and other key services to prop up the testing and tracing system.  When are we going to have an effective testing and tracing system?<\/p>  <p>  When are we going to have proper controls for international travel?  We have been promised this form, which is supposed to be online.  Up to now, there has been little more than forms being handed out, and the follow-up has been hopeless.  When are we going to have a proper system in place at our ports and airports?<\/p>  <p>  Third, when is the Government going to ensure that it is open about the data and information?  We have to keep the public with us.  Actions being taken at the moment are simply not understandable because they are not backed up by any data or evidence.<\/p>  <p>  When is the Government going to address these three areas and when is it going to play its part in responding to the virus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300004#B00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1599126000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that the Government is working collectively, and in my mind coherently, not just in managing the Covid crisis but in every aspect of the economic crisis that comes with it and across every brief.  The Deputy is correct that Covid is first and foremost, because it is the essential crisis we have to manage.  I am confident that the HSE is managing and has the capability in the testing and tracing regime we need for this country.  That capability needs some flexibility within it to increase to 100,000 tests per week and flexibility so that if the testing needs to be ramped up for a particular outbreak, that can be done.  Last week, 58,000 tests were carried out, many of which systematically targeted the key areas where we have to protect the most vulnerable, such as nursing homes, which are a key source of the problems, or the likes of meat plants, where the key element is the focus of that testing.  There are 200 contact tracing staff in place and the turnaround time, as I understand it, from referral to the giving of the test result, has fallen from three days to 2.2 days.  We need to push that further and we cannot rest on our laurels, but I believe that the HSE is managing, and can manage and deliver, the testing and tracing regime we need.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to aviation and airports, it is a difficult balancing act between protecting lives and protecting livelihoods.  Aviation and international travel are part of protecting livelihoods in this country because, as a small, open island economy, we need connectivity to other countries.  To date, judging from the health data, the level of the virus coming in from international travel is very low, but we have to maintain vigilance and not necessarily just open back up, with everybody travelling again.  There was valid advice from the health system to try to minimise travel and contact, but the Government now has to start preparing for the next six, nine or 18 months - a medium-term approach - where, in the absence of a vaccine, we have to manage the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Within that, we will have to manage international travel.  The Government will present a new medium-term Covid plan on 14 September that will include a planned approach allowing for connectivity.  At a meeting yesterday with my departmental officials who are working with the Department of Health and the Department of the Taoiseach, I asked them to look, as we have said we would, at international experience, such as where other countries require testing arrangements for air travel that may reduce the risk of increased air travel and that may allow us, in certain instances, to waive the requirement for a 14-day restriction on movement when someone comes here.  We have set up - my Department was helpful in this regard - the electronic register and contact tracing system, which will be an important part of that.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's third point, I absolutely accept the need for transparency and openness in respect of all the figures.  At the same time, we have to be careful that if we had complete transparency, there could be stigmatisation of certain communities where the virus might exist.  We have to avoid that while still providing transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300004#B00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1599126000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>With all due respect, these lines are being trotted out by everybody in Government, and they do not stand up to any kind of scrutiny.

The response from the Government has been wholly inadequate in respect of testing and tracing.  The Minister talked about last week.  A total of 57% of what we are told is the capacity was used last week, and that was the highest percentage that has ever been used.  Where is this 100%?  We have heard reports about staff being redeployed from other areas where they are needed.  That is not an adequate response.  The Government needs to start taking this issue seriously again.  The early response was fine but it took its eye off the ball.  There are a whole lot of gaps in our response.  Nobody knows what the strategy is now in respect of Covid.  We are supposed to be testing, tracing and isolating, but that is not happening at the level required.

I believe Irish Water, in particular, is a key driver of this infrastructure.  Irish Water needs to be financed to ensure vital services such as water and sewerage are available to stimulate growth in houses being built, in providing serviced sites for commercial activity and in ensuring IDA Ireland has serviced sites to attract foreign direct investment and indigenous investment.  The programme for Government contains aspirations for balanced regional development.  If they are to be realised, the Government will need immediately to set the agenda for Irish Water and to supply the necessary funding.<\/p>  <p>  I give as an example my own county, Galway.  It has been held back because of this lack of investment.  Growth centres all around Galway city are at a standstill.  Why is this happening?  Galway County Council cannot give planning permission for developments because there are no municipal wastewater treatment facilities available in the towns and villages.  For example, Craughwell, Corofin, Abbeyknockmoy, Clarinbridge, Kilcolgan, Ballinderreen, Ardrahan, Labane, Turloughmore, Lackagh, Kilconnell, Cappataggle, Mountbellew and so on are precluded from building any housing developments due to decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that any development in these towns or villages is premature until a public wastewater treatment plant is built.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has compounded the matter by ruling out housing in these areas with individual septic tanks.  It has ruled all development out.<\/p>  <p>  Another example is the IDA Ireland site in Athenry.  Athenry is at the crossroads of motorways and railways and it is ripe for development but that site does not have any water or sewerage connection so no investors can use that site.  Galway County Council has a county development plan setting out the way that County Galway and Galway city will develop, but this plan has also been stalled.  For example, we have what we call the Ardaun corridor, stretching east from Galway city towards Athenry.  Since we do not have what we call the east Galway wastewater treatment plant on anybody's agenda, no development can happen here.  We talk about the congestion of traffic in Galway city.  Until we get this investment and Irish Water is fully financed, we will not be making any regional development happen, especially when one looks at an example such as County Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300005#C00500","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1599126600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Canney for raising an important issue in the development of our country, planning forward.  I have some broad points to make with regard to the funding of Irish Water.  There was agreement in the last D&aacute;il at an Oireachtas committee about the approach that would be taken.  I believe there was and still is cross-party and independent support for that approach, so I do not see it changing.  It will involve the introduction of water charges where the excessive wasteful use of water is clear and evident.  That will provide certain funding but more importantly it will provide a signal to avoid wasteful use of a precious resource.<\/p>  <p>  The broad economic approach of this Government will have to involve managing ourselves out of an economic difficulty through investment.  We will not contract our way out of this economic downturn.  Investment in capital infrastructure has to be our guiding star.  At a time of low interest rates, when our infrastructure is holding back development in a variety of ways in water, public transport and housing, that is the critical investment we need to do, which will create jobs and avoid some economic mistakes of the previous period.  This Government is and will be committed to expanding or investing in capital projects, especially those which, as the Deputy says, have co-benefits in that they allow other developments to take place.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to water investment, it is interesting that the Deputy takes Galway as an example because Galway has historically suffered more than many other counties due to lack of investment in wastewater treatment as well as water supplies.  The wastewater treatment, which is often less visible or seen as less of a priority, is where particular problems have occurred in Galway.  I support and agree with the Deputy's case for investment in that type of infrastructure in places such as the Ardaun corridor and Athenry.  If we can combine that development with improving and upgrading the rail system there, that would the sort of co-ordinated, planned and sustainable development we seek to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital in that regard that we heed the advice of the national planning framework and look for concentrated development.  The authorities are right to say we should move away from the use of septic tanks, because that has brought significant difficulty to managing water quality and the problems that brings for our rivers and water systems elsewhere.  By concentrating development around infrastructure spending and existing towns and villages and new developments close to public transport and infrastructure development, that is where success will lie.  In any dealings with the Government, I will absolutely look to see how we can prioritise capital investment in Irish Water and in projects such as the ones the Deputy cited because they provide the sort of sustainable development we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300005#C00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1599126600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's positive words about the development.

The reality, which I see and know at first hand, is that in many of these estates the treatment plants are an environmental disaster about to happen.  There is no maintenance happening and nobody is taking responsibility, and this also needs to be factored in.  I believe a working group in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was looking at this, but looking at it is no good.  We need the funding to make sure it is sorted out.

The people of Rathbarry, Rosscarbery, Connonagh, Leap, Skibbereen, Bandon, Dunmanway and Bantry have experienced flooding beyond belief.  Businesses such as the Eldon Hotel in Skibbereen, Wiseman's shop in Bantry and Con Linehan's clothes shop in Bandon are just a few that I can mention which had substantial losses due to these floods.<\/p> <p>On this shocking night Lucey's Bar, the Anchor Bar, the Cosy Cabin in Bantry, as well as Cahalane's in Skibbereen opened their doors for the first time in almost six months but this was just to let flood water and muck out of their ruined premises.  I spent hours in Bantry on the night of the floods and saw the sheer agony on people's faces.  There were neighbours helping neighbours to try to save what was left of their businesses and homes.  One lady told me that her business was closed for 12 weeks due to Covid-19.  They had just reopened and she asked me to look at her stock.  It was swimming around, which I could clearly see as my knee-high wellington boots filled with water.  Private residences in Rosscarbery, Connonagh and Leap have also been ruined.  This is simply due to rivers not being cleaned out.  One house in Connonagh has been flooded three times in two weeks.  The first flood was 5 ft high, the second time it was 12 in. high, and the third time it was 8 in. high.<\/p> <p> The floods in each area have left dozens of unanswered questions.  Much of this flooding could be avoided but common sense has gone out the window.  Some 90% of flooding problems can be solved on the ground.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, who came down to west Cork on three occasions during those two weeks, leaving his family while on their short break.  He saw first hand the devastation and met with the powers that be who are now going to do all in their power so this would never happen again.  It is a little too late for the property that has been destroyed.  I also thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who came to west Cork on two occasions since the floods to meet with people in the affected area.  My own group leader, Deputy Mattie McGrath, also came to west Cork over the weekend to look at the flooded areas.  The Taoiseach came to Skibbereen to inspect the flooded area and the T&aacute;naiste was spotted visiting the beauty spots of west Cork, as were many more politicians this summer.<\/p> <p> I put it to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that it is now more than two weeks since many people's premises were flooded and to date all they have got is a Red Cross humanitarian form, which has been extended to areas in west Cork such as Bandon, Bantry, Skibbereen and other places.  No private residence can get funding from this fund.  If one's business has insurance one will not get funds from this fund, even though many insurance policies have an excess of some &euro;10,000.  Also, if the insurance is drawn down once, the person may never get cover again.  This is outrageous.  These innocent people have had their lives destroyed and this Government stands idly by without a clear compensation package in place for the businesses and private residences of these areas so they can pick up the pieces to try to start again.  Will the Minister answer a clear question?  Has the Government discussed funding for these people in west Cork?  If so, what kind of compensation package was discussed and when will the Government announce it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300005#C00900","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599127200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I join with Deputy Collins in extending every sympathy to those who have suffered from the floods across west Cork.  I am very familiar with many of the towns, villages and areas the Deputy mentioned.  Deputy Collins is right that it is devastating when one wakes up in the morning to see ones house or business flooded.  It is particularly worrying in places such as Skibbereen where extensive investment of some &euro;20 million was invested in flood protection measures.  Despite all of those best efforts still the streets and houses were flooded.  We saw it again in Clifden yesterday.  We are seeing extreme weather events that are a cause or function of climate change, which means what was once seen as a one in a 1,000 year event is actually happening every two or three years.  The severity is also beyond any projection and becomes increasingly difficult to counter because what is happening is beyond compare, due to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, the Government has considered looking at flood measures.  From my recollection, we have passed special motions within the Cabinet twice in the past three weeks to agree additional funding.  This will continue and we will look at it again.  With regard to those businesses and householders, this is through no fault of their own and it is important that we manage it.<\/p>  <p>  There is a particular issue around insurance and flooding.  I am aware that in my constituency it is increasingly difficult for many people to get insurance because of areas that are routinely flooded.  Deputy Doherty and others have been questioning how we manage the insurance industry.  There is the whole issue of how insurance is provided, what the rules and regulations are, and what the guarantees and protections are, which is particularly important.  I hope the new legislation on the regulation of insurance will help in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  More than anything else, we need to take a really big view on managing this project.  We need a national land use plan.  Central to that is looking at how we develop and manage our land, our forestry, our farming and planning and development, including where we put houses and the sort of infrastructure we put in place.  We should take a long-term view, knowing that climate change will lead to more extreme rainfall events.  We should try to use nature to help us in that regard so the flow coming down off the mountains is actually held back in order that we restore our wetlands, bogs and the ways water is stored rather than in the bottom of someone's home.  We need to really think big and long term.  This problem is not going to go away.  In some instances it can be addressed by short-term engineering fixes but the best long-term fix, to my mind, is us collectively and as communities managing our land and using natural systems to help store, stall and hold back water.  That is probably the biggest, best and more economically effective way for us to protect our people from severe flood damage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300006#D00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1599127200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am disappointed to hear the Minister say today that there is no clear compensation package being considered by the Government for the businesses and properties that have been destroyed in west Cork.  Humanitarian aid through the Red Cross is nowhere near enough.  It will not even cover 20% of those people who are affected.  Has the Minister any idea of the pressure these people are under?  Whether they are in Rathbarry, Rosscarbery, Connonagh, Leap, Skibbereen, Bantry or Bandon, people face tens of thousands of euro in damage due to others neglecting their surroundings.  No one cleans overfilled rivers.  The rivers are full of muck, silt or whatever polished word people want to call it.  The rivers are full of it.  I ask the Minister to come down to west Cork and I will show him first hand what is in the river at Connonagh.  It is full of silt and branches that block drains and gullies, which then results in people's homes being flooding.  There is no funding anymore for council staff to clean drains and watercourses.  There is also no one to cut back the roadside verges, biggest scourge in rural Ireland, which leads to blockages and forces floodwater onto roads and into towns and villages.  It was pointed out to me that if a Third World country was affected by flooding the Irish Government would send aid out immediately, and rightly so.  The simple question is, why not send aid to west Cork?  There is little point in the Taoiseach and Ministers coming to west Cork to sympathise with the people if they do not compensate them.

Section 3 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t3. (1) Any member, whether in uniform or not, may enter without a warrant any relevant premises at any time and there make such inspection, examination, observation and enquiry as he or she may think proper for-  \t(a) the purposes of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947, whether in relation to a relevant provision or otherwise...  <\/blockquote>  <p>My amendment seeks to delete that final half-sentence which is line 14, namely, &ldquo;whether in relation to a relevant provision or otherwise&rdquo;.  The interpretation section, under section 1 of the Bill, defines a &ldquo;direction&rdquo; given by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as &ldquo;a direction given under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947 in relation to a relevant provision&rdquo;.  Therefore, under the direction section of this Bill, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can legitimately enter a premises for the purposes of giving direction in regard to a relevant provision of this Bill.  Section 3(1)(a) expands that so they can enter the premises for the purposes of giving a direction not only under the provisions of this legislation, but also &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;, whatever &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; might mean.<\/p><p>It seems that is in conflict with the definitions section we have already agreed.  It would be the norm in legislation that the legislation acts as a coherent entity and that we do not normally provide for extraneous powers in legislation.  My question to the Minister is this.  What is the &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; provision?  I believe the House would be much safer in determining that a Garda member, whether in uniform or not, may enter without a warrant any relevant premises for the purposes of giving a direction under this Bill.  These are the issues we have talked about and debated, namely, to give garda&iacute; the power to enter a premises, and, therefore, to give a direction for any other matter outside the scope of this Bill seems contradictory to the norms of legislation, in my view.  It might be that the Minister feels there are other Covid provisions in other legislation, and that when garda&iacute; are there and see something happen, then they might as well give a direction under that as well.  I do not think that is a good way to proceed.  We need to clarify that what we are giving here is the power for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without warrant, to enter premises to do inspections.  We need to ensure that the provisions we are providing for in this legislation are met, and where they are not met, there is the capacity to give a direction to the proprietor of such a premises to comply with the legislation. <\/p><p>It is often the case the drafters slot in words like &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;, giving a much broader scope than this House would intend to legislation.  I propose, therefore, that we would delete the half-sentence that includes &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; which is encompassed by line 14, page 5, of the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300009#G00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1599128700,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Howlin's amendment.  As I said when I called the vote last night and by having the vote, this Bill is rushed and there has been no pre-legislative scrutiny.  As I also said last night, we have supported every piece of legislation from day one, when this first broke around St. Patrick's Day, blindly, I would say, and in a rush, but in good faith.  The public and the publicans have shut their doors and everyone who was asked to do anything has done it - the vast majority, with maybe a tiny percentage of people who did not.  However, fatigue, tiredness and weariness are growing.  The mixed messages from the Government and Departments, and the changing of the guard of Ministers and the Taoiseach - the whole lot - has caused huge slippage.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his words yesterday in regard to the issue in Clifden.  The Taoiseach recalled the D&aacute;il to appoint a new Minister and to deal with this legislation, but the main thrust of what we are doing is to rush this legislation through.  I believe this legislation is draconian and unprecedented, and, of course, it is obviously unprecedented because we have an unprecedented crisis.  However, there is an issue in regard to the two words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; in this section because they could mean anything.  If anyone thinks it is funny, it is not very funny for a publican who has to get his or her licence once a year in public court and run his or her business professionally, as the vast majority do.  Some 130 have been cautioned during the Covid crisis so far but they have not even been charged with anything, so far as I know.  It is a sledgehammer to crack a chestnut.  It is overbearing and overreaching to have these powers to go into premises.  The words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; could include a publican&rsquo;s home or someone else's home, and I am not satisfied that is not included in this either.  The term &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; has no business in legislation because it is too loose.  I could say, &ldquo;I caught a salmon, or otherwise I caught a trout&rdquo;.  This kind of d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i is doublethink. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned that it could be the drafters; I do not know if that is the case and I am not blaming the drafters.  However, it is very serious.  There needs to be much more clarity, given this is draconian legislation.  We cannot have loose terms like &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;, which could mean anything - it could mean &ldquo;or otherwise we could all be at home today&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;or otherwise the sky could fall&rdquo;.

The Government plan is to rush new Covid-19 enforcement laws and powers through the D&aacute;il, and it is nothing short of draconian.  There are two aims to the Bill: to provide additional enforcement powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to shut down bars and restaurants; and to give garda&iacute; the powers to go into every house in the country.  What in the name of God are we doing?  We in the D&aacute;il have supported different legislation since March and I have supported it, but enough is enough.  People are absolutely burned out and in most cases - I am talking about 99% of cases - they are completely compliant.  Those few bars that are open now are being finger-pointed as another cause for this virus.  The only time the pubs in most parts of west Cork have opened in the last six months is to let floodwater and muck fly out their doors because their doors are shut and they are being flooded from all angles.  There are already inspections in place for thousands of bars and restaurants, and most of them are compliant.  There are always a few rule breakers in every walk of society, but these laws are draconian.  Every other European country has opened its pubs but it seems we are the most stringent country when it comes to reopening.<\/p>  <p>  What this means is that many pubs will no longer be able to take the hit and will have to remain closed.  At the end of September, the moratorium for mortgages is up, which is another hit.  There is no so-called package for publicans to repay their mortgages, so what is going to happen?  The Government is giving the banks the powers to foreclose on the pubs and it is now giving garda&iacute; stronger and more stringent powers that they do not need.  They are probably finding it difficult enough to enforce the rules and regulations that are there.<\/p> <p>If these powers are given to the Government or a Minister we will enter a new society of surveillance, becoming known around the world as a police state.  There have been many house parties.  There is no doubt about that.  There have been more of them than we would like and there have been many street parties throughout the summer but the reason for this is the Government decision to not reopen the pubs and allow people an opportunity to have a drink in a controlled environment in full compliance with the guidance.  I will not support the passage of this legislation.  <\/p> <p> There have been many regulations and rules that have taken powers away from the people, including the statutory instrument signed two weeks ago by the Taoiseach which implemented penalty points in the fishing industry.  In the name of God, what are we doing?  We are taking the powers away from the hardworking people of this country.  That is a different issue.  I respect that the issue needs to be dealt with very strongly but serious questions need to be asked of our Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il in regard to the introduction of measures that could lead to the destruction of the fishing industry in this country.  The Government's introduction of far-reaching, intrusive measures under the veil of Covid-19 is nothing short of an invasion of the family and individuals and the protection afforded to everyone in their homes.  In the worst days of the Soviet Union never were such intrusions in the private homes explored.<\/p> <p> I am opposed to this Bill and the Government's proposals regarding what can happen in homes, public houses and restaurants throughout this country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300009#G00400","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599129300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I too support Deputy Howlin.

What has happened here today sends out a wrong and hurtful message to publicans in Ireland.  Before the majority of our pubs are to be given the opportunity to open their doors we are setting out in this Bill what can be done to close them down.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week on a Radio 1 programme Antoinette Cunningham, General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants in Ireland, stated that unrealistic expectations are placed on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by public commentary from Government and legislators who say these laws can be introduced but never give any thought to the final piece of it, which is how measures are to be practically enforced.  In regard to greater enforcement around the restrictions in pubs, Ms Cunningham called on the Government to consider any new laws carefully.  She made the point that as we do not live in a climate where it is practical to dine outside in winter time this will move people indoors and create difficulties in relation to social distancing as there will be bigger crowds inside pubs.  She also said that the Government should examine the legislation it is introducing to see if it is enforceable and practicable and will serve society well and, if not, it should consider reviewing it.  They are very sensible words from a sensible person who is dealing at the coalface with what it will mean to implement what the legislators are now putting forward and will become law.  <\/p>  <p>  I have a question for the Minister.  The Government in its infinite wisdom is giving additional powers to the Garda and throwing this burden of work upon it.  Does it propose to give the Garda additional resources?  I presume and assume that the answer to that question is \"No\".  When our sergeants, inspectors and chief superintendents are allocating the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from where are they to take resources in order that garda&iacute; can be deployed to the enforcement of this legislation?  This is a retrograde step.  I have often heard the leader of the Rural Independent Group, Deputy Mattie McGrath, say that rushed legislation and rushed law-making is bad law-making and he was always correct in saying it.  He has said that over many years.  I believe it to be true.  This legislation is being rushed through and legislation is wrong when it is rushed.  We are where we are.  What does the Government propose to do in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Is it to be given additional funding and will additional garda&iacute; be recruited?  Will the Garda be given additional resources to hurt the very people we should be helping?  <\/p>  <p>  I understand a group of four or six publicans from Monaghan and other parts of the country are in Merrion Square today to protest and take a stand on behalf of publicans.  I note Deputy Mattie McGrath said that publicans would also be coming here from Tipperary.  Publicans in Kerry are outraged.  Late into last night and early this morning I received telephone calls from publicans in Kerry who are dismayed.  Publicans in Currans, Cahersiveen and in every area in between are upset that legislators are debating measures to close them down before they are even allowed to reopen.  It does not make sense.  It is not logical.

That needs to be reflected on because it can be counterproductive and, I think, will be.<\/p>  <p>  On Second Stage I also highlighted that I believe this is a very flawed process.  The merit of this legislation is that if it permits pubs to open and provides the means to deal with people who are not adhering to public health guidelines it allows those who will and are adhering to public health guidelines to open and do business.  However, there is no certainty in terms of a date on when it is proposed to permit pubs to reopen.  The Social Democrats supported Second Stage of this legislation despite misgivings about the process and the lack of a regulatory impact assessment.  We will be supporting this amendment.  We need to consider what will happen if this matter ends up in the courts.  If that happens, the judge adjudicating on it will have to consider the definition and how this particular aspect compares to the definition.  The conflict that has been highlighted by Deputy Howlin will be the net point.  This matter could be resolved by the Government accepting this amendment.

I listened to Deputies Michael Collins, Michael Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath.  In my view, this is a framework under which we can start to open pubs and lift some of the restrictions that have been very difficult to manage.  Deputy Michael Collins portrayed the legislation as a means to ensure that the pubs remain closed.  It is quite the opposite.  If we want to see the opening of premises that have been closed we need to see the development of compliance protocols that will be applied by publicans and in other sectors that have difficulty opening.<\/p> <p>In an ideal world, these would be developed by voluntary associations like licensed vintners' or sporting organisations, which would set out how they believe they can protect people who come to their events or venues.  However, voluntary organisations cannot take the responsibility for society of ensuring their members are compliant.  They need to know that at the end of the day there will be powers to enforce these provisions beyond the voluntary agreement of members of associations and the goodwill that is out there.  Many publicans want and are willing to bring in provisions that will make their customers safe.  Many GAA clubs want to bring in provisions even beyond what happens in the stadium itself, as to how people coming to their events can be safe.  We need to recognise that as we move to open more things, each of us who is availing of those opportunities has to be doubly vigilant and careful to honour the protections that are there elsewhere.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide a framework within which organisations can develop safe protocols to open the things that remain closed.  That is the direction we now need to travel.  We need this legislation to be in place so that people who are going to operate in goodwill and take their responsibilities seriously, and who seek to do this in a proper way, are not undermined by those who decide not to take those responsibilities seriously or to be deliberately non-compliant.<\/p> <p> It is most unworthy of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae to suggest that providing the Garda with more resources is to hurt people.  That is not a fair interpretation of the way in which the Garda has used the powers that have been given to it by this House.  The Garda is to be commended for the proportionate way it has used powers that have been given to it.  There is no sense that the Garda is coming in with heavy-handed approaches to take enforcement measures without giving people fair warning or the opportunity to mend their ways.  The Garda has been exemplary in the use of these powers but it does need them at the end of the day.  With the best will in the world there will be people who are unwilling to be compliant or to take good advice that is afforded to them.<\/p> <p> Of course the cry is that this is rushed.  We are in the midst of a pandemic and we are trying to manage a virus without knowing its full implications.  We have to move swiftly to put in place protections but these are temporary protections, not measures to take unwarranted enforcement action against people.  These are to be a long stop to ensure we can move together as a community to address this, confident in the knowledge that people who thumb their nose at society's expectations will be brought to book eventually.  That is the context in which we should view these measures.<\/p> <p> The Minister is to be commended for bringing this Bill forward quickly and allowing us the opportunity to debate it here.  We should of course review the operation of the provisions.  This is not set for all time.  If we find in the course of operation that we need to modify some of these elements, by all means we should do so.  One of the features of this particular D&aacute;il is that we are dealing swiftly with enormous issues of huge import.  We have been able as a D&aacute;il to change our mind and see things in a fresh view.  I am looking forward to the new roadmap for the next phase of managing to live with the coronavirus.  That is really important.  This legislation is an important part of the development of that roadmap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300010#H00400","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599129900,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Honestly, only that I can see the Ceann Comhairle and other Deputies around the place I would have thought that I was in Russia or some other dictatorship with what is going on here and what is being proposed in this Bill.  I say to Deputy Bruton that he is a wizard.  After six months or more with rural pubs being closed, now he is suggesting that it is the publicans who should bring forward the rules and ideas so they can open their pubs.  At the same time, he is backing legislation here to penalise pubs whenever they do open.  This is what we are doing.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  We are shoving this down the throats of people in rural Ireland.  At the same time, day by day, it seems to me that 50% of the cases of coronavirus are emanating from Dublin or the greater Dublin area.  Two thirds of the pubs are open here in Dublin.  Two thirds of them are still closed down in Kerry and along the west coast.  These people have done nothing wrong.<\/p>  <p>  We are suggesting that uniformed or plain-clothes garda&iacute; can enter a premises.  It does not say whether it is a private house out in the country where people are terrified.  What the Government is suggesting is that when a knock comes at the door and someone says they are a member of the Garda, and the people peep around the corner and see a fellow in plain clothes, they are supposed to let him in as the Garda has powers to come in now.  When they let him in, they could find themselves corralled into a corner and the few pennies they have, wherever they are, taken from them under threat.  This is opening the door for robbery and mayhem in rural Ireland.  We do not even have the rules for the penalties being proposed.  We do not actually know what the penalties are either but we want to give powers to the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda is under pressure.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has asked where the extra funding is going to come from.  We do not have funding at present to pay for a few minutes more of extra home help for people who want to stay in their houses for the remainder of their days on this earth after serving their country, families and communities well.  We cannot provide a few extra minutes.  We cannot pay the farmers who have built buildings to regulation.  They have got planning permission and dealt with 14 or 18 serious rules so that they can build buildings to prevent pollution and adhere to good practice on their farms.  How many of these people have been paid the grants due to them since 2019 or 2020?  We are becoming like the dictatorships in Russia and other places around the world.<\/p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Michael Collins raising a matter I have been made aware of as well.  Fishermen are going to get penalty points for breaches of regulations without recourse to any judge or law.  It is only just someone coming on board their fishing boat and giving them penalty points.  They have no right or recourse to challenge these penalty points anywhere only take them and reduce the value of their asset.  That is a long story but it is what is going on in this country now.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the idea that publicans must now at this stage come forward and give ideas to the Government as to how they may be allowed to open their pubs.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely scandalous and shameless from a long-standing Member like Deputy Bruton that he would make such a suggestion at this stage.  It is sticking publicans' noses further into the ground after they have been closed for six months.  Does the Deputy know many publicans cannot pay college fees for family members or loans they have taken out?  They are facing an end to the mortgage moratorium later this month.  They do not know what way they will turn and we are legislating to bring them down further.<\/p> <p> What is going on here is absolutely ridiculous.  I support Deputy Howlin's amendment.  It is what we should do because the private home of an ordinary person is his or her castle and it should remain so.  We must not give uninformed but uniformed people the right to knock on the door and seek to enter.  That is totally wrong and I will not accept it at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300011#J00200","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599130500,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will be brief and speak to the amendment before us.

I hope the country is watching and looking at the people who voted, by 110 votes to ten, to carry the legislation through Second Stage as it is.  I commend the likes of Deputy Howlin, the rural Independents, and all the others who came here to amend the legislation to ensure it is correct and proper.  We are rushing through legislation to allow more powers for garda&iacute;, but currently the same garda&iacute; are telling us they cannot do their job properly because they spend most of their day sitting down trying to do paperwork.  If there is to be legislation giving extra powers to garda&iacute;, we must provide extra resources.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has closed rural Ireland while leaving large cities and towns open.  It has demonstrated no respect for rural Ireland or any of its businesses.  This is not just about the pubs.  We all speak about social distancing of 2 m here and 2 m there, which is fine, and bus capacity has been reduced to 50%.  People have been put into school with 2 m of social distance where possible, although otherwise people may sit 1 m away.  People need to keep 2 m away on a bus.  Much legislation should be passed but instead the Government is rushing through this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We should make people responsible for the flooding that happened in the past couple of weeks because of the negligence of the Office of Public Works and county councils.  They were negligent by not putting in the proper resources to dredge or drain rivers, clear gullies and provide natural maintenance.  This is what the emergency legislation should be about.  The House should unanimously support such action.  Instead, everybody in the House, except rural Independents and others, is voting to pass this legislation.  We are saying this is not right.<\/p>  <p>  Rural pubs have been closed and people from rural communities have been sent into cities and large towns, which are overpopulated areas, if they want a sociable drink.  That drink may be alcoholic, a mineral or even a cup of tea.  The Government is forcing people into these overpopulated areas.  All it can come up with is extra legislation for the Garda, which is currently under-resourced.  The Government wanted to include a provision for garda&iacute; to enter premises to stop the potential spread of Covid-19 or for other reasons.  Get it right if emergency legislation is to be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday we had six hours to debate this Bill.  The legislation was published on the Friday night, but on our first day of this D&aacute;il session, the Government wanted to rush through this legislation.  It seems the Government wants to rush through everything now, including a provision to allow garda&iacute; to enter houses.  The Government had to row back on that because of the rush.  By voting for the legislation as it is, Members are giving power to the Minister to make regulations by himself or herself without coming to the Oireachtas or debating such matters.  That is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation to be put in place should be debated properly and given adequate time for such debate.  Everything the Government is doing is to rush legislation.  It is an absolute disgrace that something like this is being rushed when our schoolchildren cannot even get to school on a bus because the Government will not give proper funding.  People are entitled to get on a bus, but in rural areas larger buses are not allowed because roads are not wide enough.  This is because we must protect the birds before we protect our people.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must wake up.  Legislation must be brought forward for more important issues, including getting our people to school.  Legislation must be adequate before coming before the House.  The Government should not give all the power to one person who can make regulations, as we will see when this Bill goes through.  It will be possible for a Minister to make a regulation so garda&iacute; can enter a house.  This is what we are here for today.  We are seeking to protect people by getting legislation right.  The Government should take its time, get it right and listen to people who are trying to ensure these amendments are correct and proper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300012#K00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1599130500,"counter":51,"content":"<p>In general I would be slow to agree to any additional legislation unless it is absolutely necessary and I am glad a sunset clause has been introduced in this Bill so that, in nine or ten weeks, the provisions will lapse.<\/p>  <p>  It seems that publicans are being singled out nationally and there is not the same rush in the media and with legislators to identify the real outbreaks over the past four or five weeks, which have been in the meat factories.

At this stage we have to ask whether this is really about the risk posed by pubs and bars or moral opprobrium and our disapproval of certain behaviour.  It increasingly seems to be about the latter.  Along with the entire House I voted to give draconian powers to the Minister for Health in March.  I do not regret doing that in any way, but I will not vote to increase those powers at the end of November.  I see no evidence to support their necessity from the end of November.  This legislation is based on the assumption that those powers will roll over and a new normal will be somehow necessary.  I do not accept that because I do not accept that Covid-19 is the first serious virus this State has faced.  I am not a Covid-19 denier, not for one minute.  I accept that this is a very serious virus, with very serious repercussions for people who contract it.  It has particularly serious repercussions for certain groups of people, who should not be differentiated from everybody else in any way.  At the same time, I also accept the necessity for society to breathe and for people to live and to make informed decisions.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, when AIDS was seen as a disease of gay men, public health doctors advised gay men to avoid sexual contact with each other.  They did not do that.  I recently read a very interesting study by a Harvard professor who stated that the lesson from this is not to prescribe behaviour but to inform people of the risks of various types of activity and let them make an informed decision.  That is what we do day in, day out in every facet of society and every facet of our lives.  That is what we will have to do in this instance too.  Yes, we had a lockdown when we frankly did not know what else we could do to stop our hospitals and healthcare system from being overrun.  Thankfully we have increased the capacity of our healthcare system since then, though perhaps not by as much as I would have liked.  We have also learned much about the virus.  No public health doctor in Ireland would now countermand the direction to protect nursing homes, but that happened.  I am not apportioning blame; I am just saying that we know more now than we did then. <\/p>  <p>  This provision removed by this amendment includes the wording \"whether in relation to a relevant provision or otherwise\".  Is it really about increasing Garda powers to inspect bars because we do not approve of bars?  There are many people in society who do not approve of bars.  None of them is forced to go into one.  There are many people in society who disapprove of smoking.  Nobody is forced to smoke.  If we are seriously going to go down this road, let us ask whether we simply want to stop the sale of alcohol.  Do we want to have a prohibition era in this country?  It seems there are people who want to do that.  The latest direction from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, calls for concerts to be considered, but not concerts at which alcohol is sold.  It seems clear that we are against alcohol.  It is fine to have a mosh pit at the front of a Megadeth concert, but God forbid that someone should have some alcohol at it.  It is ridiculous and bordering on slightly irrational.<\/p>  <p>  I understand why NPHET comes up with these directions.  Any doctor who is put in a position where he or she calls the shots and politicians hide behind him or her will be incredibly conservative.  Nobody, certainly no politician, wants to take the blame for getting it wrong.  That is why we have set up this bizarre structure by which we send out a group of unelected officials to do a job for which people are elected, paid and receive a seal of office in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  I accept that those officials are working incredibly hard to keep us all safe.  This has to end at some point. <\/p>  <p>  Using Covid-19 to grant extra powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that are not about Covid-19 is reprehensible and wrong.  I support the removal of the provision enabling that from the Bill before the D&aacute;il.  I therefore support Deputy Howlin's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300013#L00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1599131100,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this particular amendment.  I can well understand the thinking behind Deputy Howlin's amendment.  Some of us will always have reservations about such measures from a civil libertarian point of view.  I know that many people in the House have such reservations.  However, in the particular set of circumstances in which we find ourselves, the issue has broadened out.  With no disrespect to Deputy Howlin or the Deputies who have supported the amendment, if we keep going this way I fear pubs will not be able to reopen at all.  I have spoken to as many publicans as anyone else in the House, and from the very outset they have always argued that they should be allowed to open their premises subject to strict application of the regulations.  They have repeated that many times, including in the last few days.  I believe they are right.  If the regulations cannot be strictly enforced, the case for reopening the pubs is weakened and some may never reopen.  Maybe some people want to change the way we live in this way.<\/p>  <p>  The other side of the coin is this.  Pubs cannot reopen if it means such scenes as took place in a bar in this city, where people drank, ad-libbed and danced on the counters.  A situation like that, with no regulations at all, is not in the interests of the publicans who have made a genuine case for their ability to make a living at the present time.  I know there is a sunset clause which will considerably curtail the legislation.  If circumstances arise which were not anticipated in the drafting of the Bill, I am sure the legislation can be changed.  Unfortunately, we do not live in ordinary times.  We live in very difficult ones.  The virus is still around and is changing by the hour.  It is still rampaging almost as it did in the beginning.  We have to live with it, controlling it by curtailing our own activities.  We also have to be able to live.<\/p> <p>The best way to achieve that equilibrium is by ensuring we put in place sufficient safeguards to enable us to say that publicans are compliant.  The fact is that publicans want to comply and they do not want to be told there will be no enforcement.  They know that if there is no enforcement and no legal backup, they will have a very much reduced case for the reopening of their premises.<\/p> <p> We in County Kildare have just come out of a second, extended lockdown.  As I said last night in the House, it was not a great experience.  There was a lot of negativity and pessimism around it and a lot of finger pointing and accusations.  There have been many outbreaks of Covid throughout the country, in meat factories and elsewhere, including in various premises where an effort was being made to comply with regulations and do the best that could be done to safeguard people.  The measures taken did not always work but a fair effort was made and it did curtail the onward march of the virus to a very considerable extent.  It did not eliminate the virus, nor could it eliminate it.<\/p> <p> Many speakers have referred in this debate to the reality that we have to live with this disease.  The only way we could eliminate it would be to close down all the ports, airports and businesses.  That did not work in a number of other places where it was attempted.  References to totalitarian states are very unfair and unnecessary and they are ill becoming of the standards normally set in this House.  If we want to introduce some kind of freedom to a business sector where owners make their living by providing entertainment for people in communities, we have to give them a chance to show they can do so safely.  We must allow them to reopen their premises in accordance with regulations which they themselves want to see enforced in a way that will protect them and their customers in all circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300013#L00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599131700,"counter":56,"content":"<p>To give context to this debate, I met a number of publicans in Limerick city a short time ago and their main request is that they be allowed to reopen.  I must be looking at different legislation from what many other speakers are seeing.  When I read section 3, I see that it makes specific reference, in subsection (1)(a), to members of the Garda entering a premises for \"the purposes of giving a direction\".  My understanding of this provision is that garda&iacute; will give a warning to a publican who is in breach of the regulations and request that he or she take action to comply.  If that is what is needed to give certainty around being able to reopen the pubs, I am satisfied with it.  One might question the allocation of extra Garda powers but they are being introduced in the context of allowing the pubs to reopen, which will be done in conjunction with the proposed roadmap.  That roadmap is due to be published on 13 September and I ask the Minister to ensure it is brought forward as quickly as possible, following engagement with publicans.  Many of the pubs in this country are family businesses which were handed down through generations.  Many others were set up by young entrepreneurs, male and female.  Those businesses are their life's work and they are genuinely and absolutely petrified that they will not be able to reopen them.  I support anything that assists in allowing pubs to reopen in a safe manner and I believe this legislation will do that.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue publicans raised with me is that if they are required to comply with these regulations, supports must be put in place to help them to do so.  I welcome the increase in the restart grant but it may not be sufficient.  Most of these premises have been closed for months.  Another issue of concern to publicans is the costs they have incurred while their businesses were closed.  Access to the Microfinance Ireland fund has been reopened, which is welcome, but there is a question as to whether the loans it provides will fit the particular requirements of publicans.  Pub owners also have serious concerns about their ability to get insurance.  There are concerns too about the ongoing uncertainty as to their future.  There is a contradiction at the moment that is hard to justify whereby pubs which can serve food are able to reopen but wet pubs cannot, even though many of them, across the length and breadth of Ireland, would probably meet social distancing requirements on any week night in the normal course of events.<\/p>  <p>  Several colleagues whom I respect on a personal level, including Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Michael Collins and others, have described the provisions in this Bill as draconian.  In fact, they are measures to enable pubs to reopen.  I want to be able to go back to publicans in Limerick city, County Limerick and north Tipperary and say to them that we are providing a roadmap that will enable their businesses to reopen.  The main focus in this legislation is not about the Garda shutting pubs overnight.  There will be a teething period as the provisions are implemented and it is hugely important that these new powers are exercised from the outset in a way that allows pubs to adapt.  Garda&iacute; are empowered under the legislation to work with publicans to ensure they are compliant.  In many cases, publicans may not be fully aware initially that they are not in compliance with the regulations.  There needs to be education around that whole area.<\/p>  <p>  Above everything else, it is vitally important that publicans are given an opportunity, pretty quickly, to reopen.  I see this legislation as a means to ensure that can happen.  Legislation nearly always includes some draconian measures.  The key elements of this Bill for me are the initial measures and the warning aspect.  I want to see the roadmap for the reopening of pubs published quickly and I would like to see publicans being able to reopen very shortly.  That is hugely important, both economically for publicans themselves and socially for the many people who are not able to get out at night and for whom the pub was the social outlet where they met their friends.  That aspect of the issue is being missed.  Reopening pubs would provide a huge benefit to communities in terms of dealing with the mental health issues some people are facing.  We are talking about people's ability to get out and about and meet and converse with others.  The pub is an environment that allows that to take place.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I reiterate that we must look again at the support measures being provided to publicans.  In many cases, their premises have been shut for the bones of six months and they want to get back up and running.  As I said, there must be supports available in the form of grants.  Another speaker made reference to the moratorium on loan repayments ending this month.  We need to look at that again and consider other measures for providing inexpensive loans to publicans.  We must ensure they can qualify for insurance.  I support this legislation, which includes a sunset clause.  Some speakers have talked about it as if it is a long-term measure.  In fact, it covers a nine-week period to enable us to put supports in place to ensure publicans can reopen their premises.  They are entitled to be given the opportunity to reopen and this measure, among others, will assist them in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300014#M00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1599131700,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Three or four weeks ago, I attended a meeting at the Bush Hotel with a group of vintners.  There was a large turnout, with 25 or 30 publicans from all over Sligo and Leitrim in attendance as well as three out of the four Deputies, including me, who represent the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  The main message I got that day was that publicans want to get back behind the counter and to reopen their businesses in a responsible way.  They pointed out that many of them have family members who are vulnerable to Covid and they recognise the need to be careful and to comply with whatever restrictions are in place.  They were really anxious that they should be allowed to do so.<\/p>  <p>They were also anxious, if that could not happen, that a proper compensation package or other measure would be put in place to ensure they could survive into the future.  Apart from that, the real thing they wanted was to be able to open.<\/p> <p> They were critical of and there was much anger about a very small number of pubs in my constituency that were open and were abusing the situation.  The vintners were of the opinion that something had to be done about those pubs.  Examples of such businesses were given and discussed.  The vast majority of the pubs that are open and serving food are doing so in a responsible way.  They have screens, PPE and hand sanitisers and they ensure people order food when they come in.  They serve food on the premises in a responsible way.  They write down the names of their customers and the times they have been there and do all of that properly.  That is how the majority of open pubs are operating, but there is a small minority of whom all Deputies have heard who are abusing the situation.  Those pubs may be full, lack social distancing and have people on the premises who are very drunk.  The rules are not being adhered to in those pubs.  The vintners who are watching on and cannot open their pubs are saying that something must be done about this.  I accept and understand that that is what the Bill will do.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in generally supports it although, as many Deputies have stated, it is draconian legislation.  It is exactly the kind of thing we should not be doing, but we are in a situation that is far removed from normal circumstances.  This is abnormal legislation for abnormal times.  That is the message we need to bring home clearly.<\/p> <p> On the issue of the other pubs reopening, the real problem is that the Government messed this up a couple of months ago when it allowed some pubs to open because they serve food but other pubs were not allowed to open.  Proper thought should have been put into that, even if it delayed the reopening for a week or two, in order to get it right and allow all pubs to open.  That could be done if the number of customers in each pub was limited.  Some people have asked how that would be policed.  As a constructive suggestion, I note that every licensed premises in the country must be inspected by a fire officer who states clearly on the fire certificate the maximum number of people it is appropriate or safe to have on the premises.  That is how it happens when there is no Covid.  It would be very apt to bring in a regulation to specify an appropriate percentage, such as 35%, of the maximum number that could be on the premises under normal circumstances.  If the fire certificate of a pub stipulates that it should have no more than 100 people in it, such a regulation could provide that it could have no more than 35 people on the premises in order to allow for social distancing.  If a measure of that kind was put in place for all pubs, along with all of the other measures such as recording who comes in and at what time, their names and phone numbers and so on, ensuring the usage of PPE and social distancing and doing all of that properly, every pub in the country should be able to open.<\/p> <p> The Garda should be able to go in and check that all the regulations are being adhered to.  If somebody is acting the maggot and not doing things as they are supposed to be done, that person is endangering not just other publicans, although that is part of it, he or she is endangering his or her own community, staff and family.  We need to ensure that does not happen.  The way forward is to come up with a solution by virtue of which all pubs can open under strict guidelines that are strictly adhered to, with strong measures in place to ensure that is done.  That is what this legislation does.<\/p> <p> I know there are certain issues with regard to the Bill.  Deputies have raised such issues, particularly the fact the inspecting Garda member need not be in uniform or the reference to \"relevant premises\".  I point out that section 2 defines a relevant premises as a premises \"where intoxicating liquor is sold or supplied for consumption on the premises - (a) under a licence, or (b) of a club\".  The Bill does not apply to houses but, rather, licensed premises and clubs.  In those circumstances, this legislation is appropriate for the times we are in.  It would be totally inappropriate for it be brought in in normal circumstances, as all Deputies are aware.<\/p> <p> The issues have been discussed in the round in great detail.  I accept that the members of NPHET are the experts in this matter.  They are the medical experts who meet collectively to discuss and debate every possibility and context in which Covid is a danger to our community, people and health services.  They come up with proposals regarding what can be done.  Those proposals are put to the Government and the Cabinet makes decisions on them.  By and large, we accept that those proposals are made in the best of faith and that most of the measures are brought in in good faith in order to protect the community.  That is why we are all trying to work together to make that happen.  It may be that in a month's time or two months' time NPHET may put forward another proposal in respect of pubs.  There needs to be a little flexibility to allow such proposals to be implemented and, if appropriate, to allow the Garda to ensure that those regulations are adhered to properly.<\/p> <p> Many Deputies referred to this being rushed legislation.  I absolutely agree that it has been rushed and should not be brought in in this way.  We should have committees up and running, but we do not have them.  We should have pre-legislative scrutiny but we cannot have it if the committees are not up and running.  All of that is clear.  I was significantly angered by the way legislation was dealt with in the final days before the summer recess.  A section was inserted into the Bill but Opposition Deputies were given no prior notice of that.  How it was handled was an absolute scandal and looked very bad for the Department, the Minister and everyone involved.  However, that has not happened in the context of this Bill.  It does what it says on the bottle.  We should try to work together to make it happen.<\/p> <p> The sunset clause whereby the powers will lapse on 9 November must be adhered to.  The D&aacute;il must consider the matter again on 9 November.  It is to be hoped that we will be in a better situation by then and will be trying to get more things open and more parts of our society to work better together to better deal with Covid.  We all need to work together to do that.  The virus is not going to go away; it will be here for quite a long time.  I understand from where people are coming with regard to attacking the Bill and stating it is this, that or the other.  It is a reflection of the anger, suspicion and worry that many people have.  Their lives have been impacted so negatively by all of this but, at the end of the day, Deputies must work together in the best interest of the public good.  That is what we are here to do.  If we can do so with regard to this legislation, accepting that it has a sunset clause and will end on 9 November unless the House decides to extend it, that is the way forward.  We need to look at it in the round and see exactly what it will do.<\/p> <p> On the amendment, I await with interest the Minister's response to it and her rational for the inclusion of the relevant clause.  If there are good reasons for the clause, we must accept them, but if there are not, the amendment should be accepted by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300014#M00300","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599132300,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I strongly oppose this measure.

There is a total disconnect with rural Ireland and what is happening there.  This will cause more division because people have gone out of their way.  There is a very small element in big cities where there were breaches and which needs to be monitored.  I absolutely agree that they should be monitored, but rural businesses should not be punished.  They have already been punished severely.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of collaboration and consultation has been shameful.  Why was the road map for reopening pubs not produced at the same time as this legislation?  It is all one-way traffic.  It is a very heavy-handed and unfair approach.  I urge the Government to think carefully about doing this.  The Bill is going to create problems and issues will arise from it.  The Garda has more to do than to check all the pubs.  There has been a shortage of garda&iacute; in my constituency of Laois-Offaly for many years.  I do not know how the garda&iacute; there will be able to get to grips with rural crime and anti-social behaviour as well as having to monitor pubs.  There is no need for them to do so because the vast majority of publicans are very responsible people.  It is totally unnecessary.<\/p> <p>This Government being so out of touch with rural Ireland, I suggest they take a staycation in rural counties.  If they take that staycation, maybe they will see the reality: how we operate, how we survive against the odds in rural Ireland and how many of our businesses have been unfairly decimated because of ill-thought-out legislation and the lack of adequate supports.<\/p> <p> I believe this is a grave mistake.  I hope that supports will be given to the publicans and that the trust that is broken and the relationships that have been broken down as a result of this will be rebuilt constructively in some shape or form because we all need to work together on this issue.  Pubs and restaurants have been treated shamefully.<\/p> <p> In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, we were already stigmatised with an unnecessary lockdown because a localised lockdown was not implemented and, instead, three counties were entirely closed down.  In the case of Laois-Offaly, it was completely wrong.  That already has caused problems and, indeed, has created a stigma.  We will have a worse situation now with these draconian measures being brought in and with there being a breakdown now in collaboration.  There was never proper collaboration in the first place because representatives from those businesses and the vintners' association should have been included.  The hospitality sector was completely shut out all along with the different measures that have been brought in.  There was no consultation and no collaboration.  There was one-way traffic and a heavy-handed approach.

First, it is reasonable to say that this is rushed legislation where there is much detail that needs to be scrutinised and fully understood.  I do not accept that, because the committees were not up and running, we could not have done that.  We set up the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response specifically to deal with Covid-19 matters, and I see no reason the Bill could not have been referred to that committee to undertake more detailed scrutiny on it.<\/p><p>I am conscious that we must bring in measures quickly to respond to an unpredictable virus that we do not yet fully understand and where we do not know the trajectory of infection, sickness, hospitalisation and where it could go.  There is no doubt that one of the environments in which Covid-19 almost certainly likes to transmit is where there are large numbers of people in an enclosed space drinking alcohol, with raised voices, singing etc.  We know enough of the science to know that this is an environment in which Covid-19 is likely to spread and it is right that the Government and all of us would want to ensure that we do not give licence to situations which are likely to become super-spreading environments.<\/p><p>Having said that, those who are concerned about this Bill have also made reasonable points.  I took a staycation, as I suspect most in this House did, in rural counties and there is no doubt that the vast majority of licensed premises selling food and allowed to open were abiding by the restrictions and were being compliant.  I have no doubt that if pubs reopen, the vast majority will do likewise.  We also know that the potential is there.  There have been some instances of reckless behaviour which could be extremely dangerous in terms of the transmission of the virus and it is reasonable for the Government to want to have measures in place to ensure that action can be taken swiftly to deal with that.  Therefore, this is a fine balance.<\/p><p>However, and this is the point about this amendment and my party's amendment that comes later, there is a problem with the legislation, what the Government says it is about, and what it might allow the Government to do.  Deputy Howlin points out that, in line 13 on page 5, where the Bill refers to &quot;the purposes of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947&quot;, the Health Act which has been amended to give powers in relation to Covid-19, it states in line 14 &quot;whether in relation to a relevant provision or otherwise&quot;.  Therefore, it is not only the relevant provision as set out in the amended legislation but could be something else.  That seems dodgy from a legal point of view.  It means we do not really know what we are doing here or what the possible consequences of this might be.<\/p><p>I will go on to explain, in terms of my party's amendment seeking to delete section 13, that similar problems exist there.  The Bill says it is doing a limited set of things relating to pubs to ensure compliance and prevent the transmission of the virus, but it then possibly gives other powers or rights to the Minister to do other things under the Health Act that are not necessarily related to that at all, and potentially to do other things completely beyond the scope of the stated intention of this Bill.  That is the concern.  In that sense, it is sloppy or it is potentially giving the Government <i>carte blanche<\/i>to do other things that are not stated as the intention of the Bill.  Deputy Howlin is right in this regard, and similarly, as I will go on to argue, in section 13, which should be deleted because it gives unspecified powers to do other things beyond what is stated as the intention of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300016#O00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1599132900,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for tabling this amendment.  I will touch on a few points that have been raised but are obviously relevant to this.  It has been suggested that this legislation is anti-publican and anti-rural Ireland.  As the Minister who is bringing this forward and as somebody who has worked in a pub for almost a third of her life, most of the time in a rural pub, I can reassure Deputies that this is nothing of the sort.  What I believe this does for those publicans whose premises are open at present and who are serving food, for restaurateurs, for clubs, whether GAA clubs that have bars or private clubs, and for the vast majority of people who are adhering to the public health regulations who have done so much to make sure that they are in compliance and are working hard is let them see that for those who are not, who are breaking the rules and breaking the law, there are consequences.  It also provides clarity because a number of people have mentioned commentary over the weekend.  I fully accept that it has been challenging over recent weeks and months where there have been different regulations and where things have, perhaps, changed more quickly than we would like.  It provides greater clarity for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they enter a premises as to whether somebody is breaking the law.  That is what people want.  I certainly think that is what the publicans want.  This is what this legislation is doing.<\/p>  <p>  I am assured that this legislation is not flawed and that there are not errors in it.  This has gone through the capable hands of our drafters, with officials in my Department and with the Attorney General.  While we have waived the pre-legislative scrutiny, and I sincerely thank the Deputies for allowing that, we have been careful.  The drafters are careful in the language that they have used and everything that is in this Bill is here for a reason.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Howlin's amendment where he proposes to delete the clause \"whether in relation to a relevant provision or otherwise,\" first, I would note, and it is something that was said yesterday and repeated today, there is absolutely nothing in this Bill that in any way allows a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter a home.<\/p> <p>There was reference earlier that the word \"otherwise\" could refer to anything.  It is very clear, as Deputy Martin Kenny outlined, that a relevant premises, as indicated in the legislation, is only in relation to a premises that sells alcohol or has a liquor licence, whether it is a pub, restaurant or club.  There is absolutely no provision in the legislation, nor will there be legislation, that will allow a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter someone's home.  The only way that can happen is with a warrant and that will continue to be the case.<\/p> <p> Section 3 in its entirety provides a power of entry for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a licensed premises or a registered club in order to check for compliance with Covid-19 regulations and to enforce those regulations where enforcement becomes necessary.  If someone enters a premises and asks that it become compliant, and it does, little needs to be done after that.  Enforcement maybe by way of certain powers already contained in the Health Act or through the new enforcement power which has been allocated in the Bill.  Section 3(1)(a) which is the specific section raised by Deputy Howlin provides the power of entry for \"the purposes of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947,\" to comply with regulations where the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reasonable cause to believe there is a breach of regulations.  It allows them to enter where the \"otherwise\" part, which Deputy Howlin and others have highlighted, refers to the fact that under section 31A(7), which is the Health Act under the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, a garda can direct a person to comply with any penal regulations.  Penal regulations have been introduced that may not be specific to this legislation in relation to the direction a garda will give to either close the premises for the remainder of the day, or for three, seven or 30 days, depending on whether the case goes to the District Court.  They have been introduced under emergency health legislation where it is a crime where someone is not in compliance with the penal regulations.  Already, under statutory and common law powers of entry, garda&iacute; have an ability to check for compliance with the regulations or penal regulations and issue directions to comply.  The Bill establishes a very clear and specific power of entry for the garda&iacute; for these purposes where someone is in breach of a penal provision enacted by the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p> It is also important to note in regard to any of the regulations that the penal regulations introduced by the Minister for Health must be laid before the Houses and either House can, by resolution, annul such a resolution within 21 days.  There is parliamentary oversight of the regulations and penal provisions of the Minister's provisions.<\/p> <p> As currently worded, the power of entry will apply for the purpose of giving a direction to comply with any penal provision under the Health Act regulation in respect of any relevant premises.  The section does not allow them to enter any other premises, merely to ensure that if someone is in breach of the penal provision directly related to the specific Health Act, namely, the emergency Act that comes under the Minister for Health, that they will be allowed to do so.  They may not enter for some other reason and catch someone out while there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300016#O00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599133500,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate although much of it was Second Stage debate again.  We covered a lot of territory.  I wish to be clear that the Labour Party supported the legislation, reluctantly, because it is not normal legislation to provide such significant powers to a Minister, in this case the Minister for Health, to draw up regulations that are penal provisions and are crimes punishable by fines or imprisonment.  That is not normal, but we do not live in normal times and for that reason we supported the legislation on Second Stage.  Equally, we as a House have absolute responsibility.  I listened to some of the Government contributions.  Deputy Bruton did not mention the amendment.  We need to ensure that the laws we enact are very clear.  I was taken by the Minister's comment that this will provide clarity to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Like others, I listened to the representative of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors last weekend.  The representative body of middle ranking members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na says the current corpus of law is not clear to them.  That is not good.  We need to have clarity for our citizenry on what is and is not allowed, what is punishable by law and what is not, and we also need it for those who we charge with enforcing the law.  That is why we have responsibility in this provision, emergency as it is and necessary as the majority of the House believe it to be, to be as correct as we can make it.  That is why in amendment No. 1 which I put down, I want to be very clear that in normal law the Bill before the House sets out to define what each phrase in the Bill and subsequent Act is meant to mean.  The interpretation section, which we supported, states &quot;the purposes of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947, whether in relation to a relevant provision&quot;, and a relevant provision is a relevant provision of this Bill.  The problem is that contradicts the section we are debating, namely, section 3, which gives the powers to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in uniform or not to enter without a warrant any relevant premises.  The Minister and Deputy Kenny are absolutely right that the premises that can be entered are very clearly set out and limited to those set out in subsection (2) which is any premises which is licensed for the sale of alcohol.  It is confined to that and I have never suggested otherwise.  It is for the purpose of giving a direction under the amendment we already made to the 1947 Act in March which is to allow the Minister to make provision for the protection of the community against Covid-19.  My problem is that the Minister, in the draft before us, wants to go further than that.  I refer to the purpose of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947, whether in relation to a relevant provision of this Bill or otherwise.  If I understand the Minister's response, which we have just heard, the &quot;or otherwise&quot; refers to other penal provisions that are made that are not encompassed by this Act but it does not say that.  It does not state for &quot;the purposes of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947, whether in relation to a relevant provision of this Act or any other penal provision in relation to the 1947 Act&quot;, but it states simply &quot;or otherwise&quot;.  That will add confusion, uncertainty and diminish the effectiveness of the legislation and the intent of the Minister.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  It does no damage to the intent of the Bill, which, as many said, is to provide an environment for the safe operation of licensed premises.<\/p><p>In my Second Stage speech I pointed out that many of the provisions set out by the Minister in regulations, which he signed on Monday, are not penal, and that people will assume have the power of enforcement but that simply do not. <b><\/b>Some of them were spun by the Government.  For example, I read in the newspapers that it was intended to make it mandatory for staff in bars to wear masks, which I think would be reasonable, but that is not in the penal provisions in the draft signed by the Minister for Health.  Maybe it is intended for a  series of amendments to be signed in the future.  One of the House's concerns about legislation like this is that it enables the Minister for Health to make regulations under the 1947 Act that will create new crimes.  We can annul that in due course but it is an extraordinary power.<\/p> <p>I am not certain that it is entirely a constitutional power for a Minister, under a statutory instrument, to create new crimes that are punishable by imprisonment or fines.<\/p> <p> We travelled that road when we passed, I think unanimously, the legislation in March to give the Minister for Health the power to do that, but let us now be very cautious in each of the steps we are taking.  Having listened to the reasoning given by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, for demanding the retention of the words \"or otherwise\", I ask her to think again.  It is not confined, in the way she has suggested, to penal provisions, because it does not state that.  The words \"or otherwise\" have to be read as simple English - that is what legislation normally is - rather then what one intends them to mean.  Legislation means what the words actually mean, and the relevant words here are \"or otherwise\".<\/p> <p> I think it would be much safer, and we would achieve the objectives of the majority in the House, if we were to create a protective environment where all pubs can be open.  As I said in my Second Stage contribution yesterday, from the beginning I questioned the then Minister for Health about the notion that selling food to a value of &euro;9 was somehow an acceptable way to determine which pubs should be allowed to open.  I, like others, have met publicans from my constituency.  Along with the four other Wexford Deputies, I have heard that more and more publicans are selling food of some description simply to survive.  Allowing more venues to open would put less pressure on those that are open, in terms of the concentration of public business.<\/p> <p> I am anxious, as everybody else is, including the Labour Party, to facilitate the opening of pubs.  I ask the Minister to set out a roadmap for the opening of all pubs, and the Bill will help that.  In order to do that, however, we need to do it in such a way that every publican, public house owner, operator, worker or client, and above all, every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, knows exactly what the legal powers are.  I respectfully ask that those of us who want to support the Minister, and who have supported her in what she is doing with the Bill, concede that the inclusion of \"or otherwise\" is an ambiguity too far and accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300017#P00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599134100,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I will give the Minister an opportunity to respond to the Deputy's question before I call Deputy Mattie McGrath.

Under the overall Act, measures have been brought in that are law but are not penal provisions.  Section 31A(7) is specific to penal provisions.  In the second piece, the penal provisions related to the legislation before us provide for the Garda to be able to enforce either the closure for up to a day, three days, seven days or 30 days, or other penal provisions related to health.  If garda&iacute; see that a person on a licensed premises is breaking the law or a penal provision that has been included as part of the regulations, where it is in contravention of public health guidelines or where there is a risk to somebody's health, under various statutory and common law powers they already have an ability to enter that premises.  The Bill will just make that very clear.  The first subsection, which involves section 31A(7) of the Act, refers to all the penal provisions relating to premises where alcohol is sold.  It is not just those provisions that are prescribed specifically for the enforcement of this legislation but also where other penal provisions are breached.

He is dead right.  We are down to a matter of two words.  On Sunday, I heard a representative of an organisation - I cannot remember which one it was - questioning the uncertainty and the unclear guidelines under which garda&iacute; must operate in the context of Covid-19.  We all support, salute and compliment the Garda, including in Tipperary and elsewhere where I have engaged with it.  It has been great and it has been a great revisiting of the community spirit, community alert and support for the Garda.  It has been great, despite all the bad aspects of Covid, that the Garda has done well, which gives an element of hope for the future of the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  This is putting garda&iacute; in an invidious position, as the representative in question noted as well.  I also heard her say that some of the penal provisions were civil matters.  My understanding is that they cannot be and that the Garda has no power to make directions in that regard or to do anything with them.  I understand that a civil matter is something between the Ceann Comhairle and me, for example, where we take on our own cases.  There is utter confusion.  I cannot understand the obstinance of the Minister today - no disrespect to her personally - in refusing to remove these two words at the request of Deputies who have supported her legislation.

In many communities the last bastion is the pub because everything else is gone.  Funerals, tragedies, celebrations, christenings and parties are held in the public house, and publicans make their places available, warm and with comfortable surroundings in a safe and managed environment, which they have to do to secure a licence but they want to do it anyway.

The Government is dangling a string in front of publicans, but as well as that, it is tying two hands behind their backs and blindfolding one eye.  It is silly.

Why does the Minister want to mirror this in this Bill?  This Bill is supposedly confined to licensed premises.  The notion of having a catch-all \"or otherwise\" added to it because some other regulation might be brought in such that a garda can enter under a warrant to give a direction when there by the by is not the way that normal legislation is constructed.  It is not normal to put in a catch-all so that if a garda sees something else while there, the garda can act.

If somebody feels aggrieved there is no way that the validity or reasonableness of an immediate closure order can be scrutinised by a court because if a premises is closed for the day, by the time a proprietor has any remedy it is obviously too late.  We accept that because in circumstances where there is a significant breach of the penal elements of the legislation and the guidelines drafted by the Minister for Health, an immediate closure order is required, acceptable and proportionate.  However, the fact that such an order is made means that the order, which has never been contested, challenged or scrutinised, can become grounds in and of itself for objecting in a subsequent hearing in the licensing court to the granting of a licence or a certificate for a club.  My amendment accepts the fact that an immediate closure order might well be warranted in exceptional circumstances where there is an egregious violation of the health grounds and public health has to be safeguarded.<\/p><p>Where a publican wants to contest the closure order as being unwarranted, he or she cannot do so immediately because the effect of an immediate closure order is immediate and that is done and dusted.  However, <i>prima facie<\/i>that order then becomes evidence in a subsequent licensing court hearing.  It can be argued that a premises was closed under an immediate closure order which could have serious implications for the maintenance or granting of a license for a public house.  The purpose of the amendment I am suggesting is to make such a situation contestable in the courts.  I am sure the Minister will tell me that this is the case in any event but in that case, there is no difficulty in positively saying so by adding the new subsection (6) that I am proposing.  The amendment begins as follows: <\/p><p>In page 6, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t&ldquo;(6) Nothing in this Act prevents a licensee from putting in issue or a court from determining, in subsequent legal proceedings to which the question is or may be relevant&mdash;  <\/blockquote>  <p>It then sets out the grounds that are appropriate.<\/p> <p>I do not want to sound too complicated, but in essence, where there is an immediate closure order and where, for practical reasons, there is no way of contesting it until the effect of the order is implemented in any event, then rather than it simply being a determined fact that is incontestable subsequently, we provide for a defence.  If a licensee, in a subsequent licence hearing in court, wants to set out a defence for the issue and maintain that the particular closure order was unwarranted, then it would be up to that licensee to make such a case in court in the normal circumstances.  I call on the Minister to give the safeguard that the normal rules and protections for people apply.<\/p> <p> I am not suggesting that any senior garda would act capriciously or that events might flow in a certain direction in terms of a dialogue that might happen in premises that might result in an immediate closure being given, although in objective circumstances, if a court were to look at it, that would not be warranted.  That might never arise, but should it arise, the closure order, under the terms of the amendment I am suggesting, would not be an incontestable fact in terms of any subsequent hearing in court or on the maintenance of an individual's licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300021#T00700","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599136200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I know time is short for amendments and the debate.

I do not see why it should be up to the publican to go to the expense of calling or demanding a court hearing.  If the crime were so serious, then it should be up to garda&iacute;, the superintendent or the Minister, who is demanding that these new laws be put in place, to organise the court hearing and give the publican or whoever it is a fair chance.

It is all unclear.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is totally unnecessary and draconian.  What is going on here is absolutely ridiculous.  It amounts to trying to suggest that publicans are guilty before we have any rules or regulations for them.  I have been getting cross since I heard from Deputy Bruton earlier in the day that it was up to the publicans to come forward with rules or regulations so that they may open their pubs.  Can those in Fine Gael, the party that has been in government for the past nine years, not organise the rules and regulations they want to put in place?  At this late stage, after being closed for six months, they are suggesting that the publicans should put forward the rules and regulations.  Shame on them.  They should not be in office at all and it is time for them to get out of it if that is what they are doing to ordinary good living people who have never done anything wrong.  In every group or sector in society there are people who do not adhere to the regulations and rules.  Yet, by and large, publicans for the past 150 years have abided by every law and regulation.  Going back over the decades there was ridiculous legislation by which publicans had to abide.

Moreover, if that is being used against a publican in subsequent legal proceedings, for example, when he is renewing his licence in September, then he can then go behind that and say that he accepts that it was closed for a day but he does not accept that it was correct to do so.  I think that is the effect of Deputy Howlin's amendment, if I am not incorrect.<\/p>  <p>  I am very much interested in the Minister's response to this, because at the moment it would seem to me that of course a publican can challenge being closed for a day long after the premises has been closed for a day.  I would be interested to see how the Minister suggests we can remedy that.  The Minister may say judicial review is the avenue.  Of course a person has access to judicial review and can challenge a decision.  A person has three months to challenge any administrative action, but we need to get real here.  A judicial review is carried out exclusively in the High Court by way of affidavit.  It is incredibly expensive.  To bring about a judicial review of a closure for a day would mean that a publican would have to spend tens of thousands of euro in legal fees.  With the greatest of respect, I would have thought the High Court has more to be doing than examining the appropriateness or otherwise of closing a bar for a day.  Obviously, closing a bar for a long time amounts to deprivation of livelihood, but closing a bar for a day is something that I hope is not being proposed for the High Court to examine the rights and wrongs of through judicial review.<\/p>  <p>  I am very much in agreement with Deputy Howlin and I am minded to support his amendment.<\/p> <p>Of course, I have an open mind as to what the Minister will say on how, if a publican is closed for a day, they can subsequently challenge that without going to court or without starting legal proceedings.  What legal proceedings can be taken?  If it is not a judicial review, then what is it?  If a person does not challenge something at the time, it is taken to be valid, which is an invidious position.  If a publican is closed for a day and comes back six months, nine months or a year later to renew their licence, and the local sergeant is asked if there are any objections, the sergeant might say he wishes to bring to the court's attention that this pub was closed for a day back on St. Patrick's Day.  The publican could then say they do not accept it was right to be closed for a day but that a garda told them to close for a day and, of course, they adhered to a direction of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What avenue does the publican have to challenge this?  If the Minister is saying there is no avenue to challenge this other than a judicial review, which, as I said, is utterly unworkable in terms of the reality of the caseload of the High Court and the cost of judicial review, it means Deputy Howlin's amendment is imperative so there can be justice.  It is one of the most basic principles of justice that people can challenge a State decision in respect of them if they do not agree it is correctly taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300022#U00600","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599136800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I would like to speak on Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment.  The publicans of Ireland are, after all, tax collectors, revenue collectors and collectors of excise for the State, and have collected serious amounts of money for Governments present and past, and will do so in the future, those of whom will be allowed to stay open or who will be able to stay open after this further draconian legislation is passed.<\/p>  <p>  It is ironic and beyond belief that we are here today figuring out ways of penalising people whose doors are still locked because of rules and regulations that are still in place, while the rest of Europe, including Northern Ireland and England, and other parts of the world see fit to allow their public houses to open their doors and sell alcohol in a responsible and safe way.  Our Government is insisting on making them keep their doors closed and in case publicans feel there is a movement within Government to perhaps allow them to open in the coming weeks, it is here making the hammer to hit them with. <\/p>  <p>  I take great exception to what Deputy Bruton said earlier when he tried to mislead us about what I had said very clearly.  I was stating on the record of the House that I was supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the work it is doing because I believe it has much to do as it is in keeping law and order in our State.  Here, the legislators who choose to vote for this legislation are putting a further burden on them.  What I clearly asked was whether the Government is going to give additional resources to the Garda, or in what way it is hoping to assist the Garda in implementing the legislation it is bringing forward.  Instead, Deputy Bruton changed what I said and tried to give the impression that I was saying something against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when it was exactly the opposite and I was supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  Leading people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have questioned what the Government is doing.  They have questioned this legislation and asked the Government to seriously consider it before it is enacted and passed by this House.  Even at this late stage, before any further votes take place, I would plead with the people who are blindly supporting this, many of whom have not actually read it or understood the enormity of what is going on here today.  It is ridiculous.  If anybody came into this House and asked right now, this minute, what Deputies are actually debating, what they are actually doing and what they are proposing to do to publicans and to other people, they would find it ironic beyond belief that Ministers in government see fit to be doing this at this time.  It is crazy; it is beyond belief.<\/p>  <p>  What I would say to the Minister and the Deputies who are supporting it is to look into their hearts and souls.  They should think about where they and the people before them were holding their clinics over many years, when they were damn glad to go and meet people in public houses.  Publicans facilitated politicians over the years by allowing them to go into a quiet corner or perhaps into a back room to meet with people who had issues, such as local members of the IFA, the ICMSA or the Irish Countrywomen's Association who had a matter they wanted to raise with their local politician.  They met in a public house with individuals who had problems or issues, yet this is the gratitude and the thanks we are giving those hard-working publicans and their families.  We are turning around today and figuring out ways of hurting them, which is so wrong.  That is why I am glad to have another opportunity to have a cut off this nonsense that is going on here today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300023#V00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1599136800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment.

Again, it is another rule, another regulation.  The Government is clearly forcing rules and regulations on the people of this country.<\/p><p>As I said, we supported any legislation that was brought before us in the past few months.  I personally feel that any legislation brought before us should be strong enough to enforce, if the garda&iacute; are there to enforce it, but even the Garda representative body has made it very clear they are not overly supportive of this because they do not have the manpower to carry out much of what is being proposed, although it looks good on paper.<\/p><p>Many parties are being held and that needs to be controlled because they are outside a proper control environment.  However, that is because the Government left the bar doors shut.  Unfortunately, and while I do not support this, people had pubs set up in sheds, in gardens and God only knows where because they felt there was no other place to go, whereas the controlled environment was the place to have them.  When there are situations, the rules and regulations that are already there are well complied with by publicans, and when the odd person breaks the law, the law can come down on him or her.  Now, however, the Government is striking more rules and regulations for a sector that has been finger-pointed by the Government continuously in the past six months as a sector that has been the cause of the coronavirus spreading in this country, which is outrageous.  I will certainly support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300023#V00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1599136800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Although I do not think it is the intention of Deputy Howlin, I point out that this amendment does not actually intend to provide for a right of appeal.<\/p> <p>The amendment seeks to include a provision in section 4, which the Deputy has rightly outlined deals with the immediate closure of a premises where the Garda determines there has been a serious breach of a Covid regulation despite previous Garda engagement with the premises to become compliant and it has not done so.

If, this month, a garda was to raise the fact that a premises had been closed after this legislation had been enacted, it would be the right of the publican or the licence holder to make sure that he or she could raise any of the issues outlined from (a) to (e) during that procedure.

The Minister said that people have the right to appeal.  They do not have a right to appeal.  As the Minister already outlined in response to Deputy McNamara, there is no appeal mechanism.  There is a judicial review mechanism, which for the reasons stated by Deputy McNamara is certainly not one that is open to the vast bulk of publicans either for practical reasons or for financial reasons.  The loss of a day's take would be a fraction of the cost of a day in the High Court taking judicial proceedings.  For clarity, there is no appeal mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  I have accepted in what I said that there may well be circumstances in this time of unprecedented pandemic where it is right and proper to close a premises instantly.  That is not at issue.  I understand and accept that to be the case.  My point relates to an immediate closure that cannot be challenged because it is not appealable in any way as it would have instant effect but is used in a subsequent hearing.  For the benefit of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae I am not suggesting that a person would appeal a decision to the High Court.  I am suggesting that in the normal September licensing hearings, if a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as outlined properly in terms of my intent by Deputy McNamara, objects to the granting of a licence on the basis that the premises was closed for a day under an emergency closure order encompassed by the provisions we are now enacting, that that would be contestable.  In other words, it would not be uncontestable by virtue of the fact that it happened and that would be grounds for depriving people of their licences.  I am saying that would not be right. <\/p>  <p>  As there is no appeal, it may well be the case that any fact can be presented to such a licensing court but if there is an uncontested judgment against a publican and his or her premises has been closed for a day, that is a very formidable weight of evidence.  We should state clearly that there are grounds to contest that, which I listed earlier.  The Minister's response was that the grounds set out in the manner of (a) to (e) is confining.  Section 4(2)(6)(e) states: \"any other question related to the lawful validity of the immediate closure order.\"  It does not confine anything, so there is no issue of constitutionality about it.  It is open-ended in that if there is belief that for any particular reason the closure order was invalid, it would be open for the court to hear that.  It would not be taken as wholly writ and an uncontestable fact that the premises was closed and therefore a serious breach of regulations happened and that would be cause, without further explanation, to deprive somebody of a licence.  I am suggesting that provision should be allowable in this Bill such that somebody who feels that he or she has been very unfairly treated and who has no other recourse because the decision is not appealable and it is not practical to have a judicial review - this might never arise - can state his or her case clearly under law, as we are providing for, in any subsequent court proceedings that might have a very serious implication for his or her livelihood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300024#W00700","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1599137400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>What the Deputy is outlining, particularly in terms of subparagraphs (a) to (e), is what a defence can or cannot raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300024#W00800","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1599137400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Subparagraph (e) covers everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300024#W00900","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1599137400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The matters proposed to be included are essentially matters that would form part of the State's proof in a criminal trial or hearing.

The Deputy suggests that by not including this the legislation could be unconstitutional.  Constitutionally any person or publican who feels he or she has been wronged in terms of the immediate closure order that was presented, has a right to make that case.  I misspoke earlier when I said he or she has a right of appeal.  I meant he or she has an absolute right to raise any of the issues that have been listed by Deputy Howlin in his amendment.  To set a precedent whereby we would outline and list the issues, while accepting that the Deputy has included \"any other questions\" is a matter for criminal procedure and evidence.  I do not believe such a provision belongs in this particular section.  I understand the point the Deputy makes in respect of the person who feels he or she was unfairly treated in the closure of his or premises and that decision being used in a subsequent hearing.  Again, the powers we are giving to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be used only where, despite previous engagement, a serious breach has occurred which would warrant closure of the premises for the remainder of the day.

We would be happy to let this Bill go through because we accept that it is necessary to have powers to prevent reckless behaviour in the context of licensed premises or places selling intoxicating liquor, which is a real threat to public health.

This section is essentially providing for the power that will prescribe the regulations that will apply to this particular Bill.  As it currently stands, this does not allow myself as Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Health to do anything new or for the Minister for Health in particular to do anything new.  Under the recently enacted section 31A of the Health Act 1947, the Minister for Health already has an ability to make Covid regulations and can specify which of those regulations have penal provisions and which ones do not.  It is an offence under this particular Act where somebody is in breach of that.  That is already in place.  What section 13 of the present Bill simply does is identify the particular penal provisions that are relevant for this.  When this legislation potentially passes through the Houses, if it is approved and signed into law, the Minister for Health having engaged with myself and any other relevant Department will identify as we have already done the specific penal regulations that will be relevant to this Bill so that when members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na walk into a premises they know the exact regulations that need to be adhered to and, if those are not adhered to, the garda&iacute; can move to issue a direction to enforce it that a pub is closed immediately or that further steps are taken at a later stage.<\/p> <p>If we removed this section from the Bill, it would become unworkable as the penal regulations required for garda&iacute; enforcement would not be prescribed.  The Deputy sees this as an important amendment to the Bill but if the section was removed, the Bill as a whole would not work.  It is extremely important that section 13 is retained.  It does not give any additional powers to the Minister for Health and they are already clearly enacted under section 31A of the Health Act 1947.  This simply links the two laws and following enactment of this Bill, the Minister will sign an order very clearly stating which of those provisions relate to this.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, any new provisions that the Minister must sign into law must come before the Houses.

This Bill enables me, as Minister and working with the Minister for Health and other relevant Ministers, to ensure any changes in regulations can be made without having to go through the legislative process.  This applies not just where there may be new regulations but where we remove regulations specifically applying to this.  I hope we can remove many penal provisions sooner rather than later.  It is important to acknowledge we are in a very unusual position as changes occur quickly and we are trying to respond to a global health pandemic.

If we removed section 13 from the legislation, it would essentially reduce the Bill to being unworkable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300026#Y00400","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1599138600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The position is abundantly clear from both perspectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300026#Y00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"vote","time":1599138900,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 120; N\u00edl, 15; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Brendan Griffin and Jack Chambers; N\u00edl, Deputies Mick Barry and Richard Boyd Barrett.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300027#Z00050","aye":["1587","1625","1618","1613","1549","1452","1523","1595","1614","1503","1611","1525","1602","1483","1517","1480","1451","1475","1495","1493","1501","1570","1457","1591","1454","1585","1519","1615","1488","1481","1601","1476","1623","1574","1584","1470","1505","1579","1608","1600","1597","1589","1590","1582","1449","1560","1453","1581","1506","1624","1552","1586","1559","1620","1450","1619","1610","1607","1604","1572","1583","1594","1609","1463","1606","1472","1471","1626","1546","1502","1548","1464","1455","1497","1511","1489","1554","1622","1621","1599","1603","1512","1563","1550","1553","1516","1492","1593","1598","1477","1467","1507","1545","1521","1468","1617","1575","1460","1498","1551","1485","1509","1484","1473","1500","1465","1588","1514","1567","1556","1564","1557","1479","1491","1515","1596","1513","1469","1627","1520"],"nay":["1522","1478","1482","1569","1461","1577","1605","1580","1487","1612","1518","1628","1592","1499","1547"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599138900,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Gn\u00f3 na D\u00e1la - Business of D\u00e1il","time":1599139500,"counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300028#AA00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1599139500,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Before proceeding, the Government Chip Whip has a proposal to allow some additional time to complete the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300028#AA00100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1599139500,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I propose, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or the order of the D&aacute;il yesterday, that proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages of the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 shall conclude at 3.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300028#AA00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1599139500,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Is the proposal agreed to?

The purpose of this Bill, as almost everybody accepts, is to introduce certain draconian provisions.  The Minister said it would be impracticable to have to bring in new legislation repeatedly in the circumstances of a global pandemic.  However, her party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has pointed out that Ireland is completely out of kilter with every other European state.  My question is how the pandemic is different in Ireland from how it is in every other country.  In fact, it is only different insofar as we have been more draconian with our restrictions and, frankly, those draconian restrictions have failed.  At the end of it all, our detection figures are the same as the figures in Sweden.  I am not saying that Sweden is the perfect model but I am pointing out that there were no closures of bars there and no lockdown.  In fact, at this point in time, there are no closures of bars in any other country in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  We have really draconian measures in place in this country and they have manifestly failed.  If one is to claim that they have not failed, then the only other explanation is that the figures being provided by NPHET on a daily basis are incorrect.  I do not for a moment believe that is the case.  I believe NPHET's figures are correct and I believe those figures are higher than those in other countries because the strategy we have pursued has failed and is failing.  I do not say that with any joy.  It is quite sad given the sacrifices people made in good faith, including cancelling foreign holidays after they were told that to go on such a holiday would be the great evil and must be avoided.  Yet, in countries where that type of restriction was not applied, they are not seeing the same detection figures we are seeing here.  These really draconian restrictions serve no apparent purpose because our transmission figures are now higher than they are in other countries.  At the same time, we have failed to deal with the clusters of infections that are the real cause for concern.  I understand there was a discussion in NPHET about direct provision centres but the advice that came out from senior figures in NPHET to others was that it would be politically sensitive to raise the issue.  This means we cannot look at the direct provision centres.  We will not look at meat plants because, apparently, they keep the whole show rolling.  God knows what they finance but they clearly finance something or they would not have been left to do their own thing while bar owners were being hammered.<\/p>  <p>  Even the bar owners themselves now seem to have bought into this policy that the beatings will continue until morale improves, which is, in effect, what this Bill is about.  The policy is to introduce more and more draconian legislation and make things harder and harder for people.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, has expressed reservations about this legislation.  Ordinary rank-and-file garda&iacute; throughout the State do not want it and have said it will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into disrepute.  They have a job to do and it is not exclusively to focus on bars, as the Government would have them do because somebody must be scapegoated for the failure of Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  We are told that the Bill is a temporary measure but it includes a provision to have the measures it contains rolled over.  Does anybody in this House believe the Bill will not be rolled over after November?  Does the Minister really believe that she will not be putting down an amendment in a few weeks' time to roll it over?<\/p> <p>I know it will be rolled over.  That is the nature of giving powers to organisations.  It is the nature of draconian legislation brought in with sunset clauses that are not really sunset clauses that it stays on the books forever.  We had a long debate on the matter in Leinster House.<\/p> <p> Before the House rose for the summer recess, I stated that it sets a terrible example for the D&aacute;il to be sitting in the Convention Centre.  There are 20 Deputies present - at what cost - and we are asking teachers to go back into schools.  Thankfully, they are going back into schools.  It is a significant credit to the Government and, in particular, to teachers, boards of management and parents that we have got the schools open again.  However, this situation is not an example to set for anybody.  That is why I do not think we should state that we will roll over this legislation.<\/p> <p> The Bill is unnecessary.  The only possible basis for it is if it is a promise to the people that if they can swallow this one more piece of medicine, the Government will open the pubs.  This is not about pubs, it is about society.  It is about rural Ireland, which is dying on its feet.  Young people cannot meet anywhere.  They cannot meet in bars or nightclubs or at weddings.  They cannot even go to matches.  Where will they meet?  Of course, they meet in places where we think they should not meet.  They do so because they are social animals.  We are all social animals.  We need to meet.  We need a sense of community.  A colleague of mine who is from County Kerry but lives in Dublin went down to Kerry recently.  It was the first time he had been there for many months because of Covid, etc..  He could not believe the sense of isolation, desolation and desperation in the county.  What is being done is destroying communities.  It is destroying the sense of community and society and is doing untold damage to people's physical and mental health and their sense of well-being and optimism.  It must come to an end at some point.  The logical point for it to come to an end is when the powers given to the Minister for Health in the emergency legislation for which I voted - I do not regret voting for it - lapse.  The powers have been slightly abused, but I expected that might happen.  Unfortunately, I was not disappointed in that regard.  I know the Minister for Health will table a motion to carry on these powers because that is what Departments do.  They never relinquish power.  I know the Minister for Justice will seek to roll over this legislation.  I do not believe that we can continue to roll over draconian legislation which is having such a significant effect.<\/p> <p> I am not a Covid denier.  It is a very serious virus.  It has killed people in this country and it will kill more people.  Everybody needs to be careful and cautious, but at some point we, as legislators in this House, will have to trust people and say to them to be responsible and, for God's sake, look after themselves, their family members and those with whom they come in contact.  However, we cannot continue to do that through coercive criminal legislation without destroying society and individuals.  It cannot continue indefinitely.  On that basis, I urge the Minister to put a proper sunset clause in place, a date after which these powers will not continue, especially given that any closure order made cannot be challenged.<\/p> <p> The Minister fudged the issue of how one can challenge a decision to order a pub to close for a day.  As I stated, this is about a lot more than pubs, but it is also about pubs, in accordance with the Long Title.  How does one challenge a decision to order a pub to close for a day?  One challenges it by way of judicial review.  Is the Minister seriously telling me that the 6,000 or so publicans who are shut down and on their knees, some of whom are having their payment reduced, are going to take a judicial review, hire a solicitor, junior counsel and senior counsel and go to the High Court and pay the tens of thousands of euro necessary to challenge their closure for a day?  Of course, they are not.  However, that closure for a day will be used against the publican when he or seeks to renew the liquor licence.  These are draconian powers that are having an effect on people and society and they must come to an end at some point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300028#AA01500","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599140100,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

People need to feel that they are being listened to.  They need to feel that the Government is charting how we live with this virus and will bring people with it.  There is much validity in the criticisms that were made in the House yesterday and that have been made today with regard to the Bill being a case of warning people that if they do not do certain things, these will be consequences.  If a person has a house party or does not wear a mask, the State will take action.  That kind of messaging does not appeal to people's better nature.  Rather, it erodes hope.  It is very valid to ask what kind of society we will have at the end of this.  In many ways, it is like the valley of the squinting windows.  That attitude is being encouraged.

He asked me whether we will do so on 9 November.  He asked me what the Covid situation in this country will be on that date.  I simply do not know.  The fact is that none of us knows.  This has been a very difficult and challenging period for everybody because of that uncertainty and the fact that we do not know how this will continue to permeate throughout society or whether the numbers will go up or down.  It is important that we have a clause that allows us to extend these measures if needed.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murphy asked that there be a debate on any extension of the powers.  I have no problem facilitating that.  What we would be debating, obviously, would be the extension of the legislation and not the measures therein.  I have no problem having a debate if that is what people need.  No one can pre-empt what the country will look like or the status of the pandemic on 9 November.  We need to include a provision in the Bill that allows us, if necessary, and I hope it will not be necessary, to extend these powers beyond a certain date.  I gave a commitment to Deputy Howlin or Deputy Martin Kenny that at no stage will these powers be extended for a long period.  Any extension will be for a short period and we will come back to the D&aacute;il if such further extension is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300029#BB00500","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599140100,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599140700,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Section 17 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599140700,"counter":164,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599140700,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Title be the Title to the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1599140700,"counter":166,"content":"<p>For the reason already explained regarding amendment No. 3 and the Title, we are opposing the Title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300030#CC00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"vote","time":1599140700,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 127; N\u00edl, 12; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Brendan Griffin and Jack Chambers; N\u00edl, Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300030#CC00500","aye":["1587","1625","1618","1613","1549","1452","1523","1595","1614","1503","1611","1525","1602","1482","1483","1517","1480","1451","1475","1495","1569","1493","1501","1570","1457","1591","1454","1585","1519","1571","1615","1488","1481","1601","1476","1623","1574","1584","1470","1505","1579","1608","1508","1600","1597","1589","1590","1582","1449","1560","1453","1581","1506","1605","1624","1552","1586","1559","1620","1450","1619","1610","1607","1604","1572","1583","1594","1609","1463","1606","1472","1471","1626","1546","1502","1496","1548","1464","1455","1497","1511","1489","1554","1622","1621","1599","1603","1512","1561","1563","1550","1553","1516","1492","1593","1598","1477","1467","1507","1545","1521","1468","1617","1575","1460","1498","1551","1485","1509","1484","1473","1500","1465","1588","1616","1514","1567","1556","1564","1557","1479","1515","1596","1513","1469","1627","1520"],"nay":["1522","1478","1461","1577","1580","1487","1612","1518","1628","1592","1499","1547"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599141300,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1599141300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1599141300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 126; N\u00edl, 12; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Brendan Griffin and Jack Chambers; N\u00edl, Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300031#DD00300","aye":["1587","1625","1618","1613","1549","1452","1523","1595","1614","1503","1611","1525","1602","1482","1483","1517","1480","1475","1495","1569","1493","1501","1570","1457","1591","1454","1585","1519","1571","1615","1488","1481","1601","1476","1623","1574","1584","1470","1505","1579","1608","1508","1600","1597","1589","1590","1582","1449","1560","1453","1581","1506","1605","1624","1552","1586","1559","1620","1450","1619","1610","1607","1604","1572","1583","1594","1609","1463","1606","1472","1471","1626","1546","1502","1496","1548","1464","1455","1497","1511","1489","1554","1622","1621","1599","1603","1512","1561","1563","1550","1553","1516","1492","1593","1598","1477","1467","1507","1545","1521","1617","1575","1460","1498","1551","1485","1509","1484","1473","1500","1465","1588","1616","1514","1567","1556","1564","1557","1479","1491","1515","1596","1513","1469","1627","1520"],"nay":["1522","1478","1461","1577","1580","1487","1612","1518","1628","1592","1499","1547"],"abs":[]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Back to School, Further and Higher Education and Special Education: Statements","time":1599141900,"counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300032#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1599141900,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I last spoke in this House immediately before it went in to recess.  At that time I had just published the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.  That was only five weeks ago and much has happened since then.  An incredible amount of work has been undertaken in the school sector.  As a country dealing with the challenges of Covid-19, we are in a different place now than then, but just as the publication of the roadmap represented an important milestone on the road back towards the &quot;old normal&quot;, I concede that there are many miles left on the road to normality.  I was at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response yesterday and we covered a range of the issues of concern to school communities across the country as well as to me as Minister and to Deputies.  It is a measure of the importance of education generally and indeed the education sector in this country that the Oireachtas has scheduled a significant amount of its time this week for education matters.  This level of engagement with the Oireachtas has been a feature since the closure of the education sector in March and it ensures that we keep a light on the work being undertaken and the concerns that arise.<\/p><p>As Deputies know, the re-opening of our schools was since my appointment, and continues to be, my number one priority.  It was not a hope as some would have characterised it when we were last in this House.  It was very much a realisable ambition which like all ambitions presented a series of challenges for us to address in order to realise it.  I have been fully supported by Government in putting in place the supports necessary to realise this ambition and in recent days and this week we have seen that ambition being realised.  Government has been united in viewing the re-opening of schools as a national priority.  I am very much encouraged by that cross-Government support and I wish to express my sincere thanks to all concerned.<\/p><p>Cabinet approved the Roadmap for the Full Return to School in July.  It sets out how the public health advice provided to my Department on the safe return to school could be implemented at individual school level.  Approval was given for over &euro;375 million in additional funding necessary to support its implementation.  I provided details of the supports being made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas during that last week of July and the effect of those supports has been seen across the country as schools re-opened their doors from last week.  During August, I provided a number of updates on how the planning for schools re-opening was progressing.  To date, the payments made directly to schools exceed &euro;160 million.<\/p><p>My Department brought forward the payment of the annual minor works grant to primary schools, totalling approximately &euro;30 million, which is typically paid in either December or January each year.  In addition, an enhanced minor works grant, which matches the 2019 payment, has also been issued directly to schools.  This amounts to &euro;60 million which has now been issued directly to primary schools in minor works grants since the publication of the roadmap.  A minor works grant amounting to &euro;42 million issued to post-primary schools in the free scheme.  The minor works grant provides schools with the necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly to enable the full return to school.  These measures include, but are not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, repurposing rooms to provide additional space, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts and the short-term rental of additional space.  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration measures for their school which are necessary to facilitate school re-opening.  Further, more than &euro;30 million of capitation supports has been made available to primary and post-primary schools to fund personal protective equipment and hand sanitiser requirements.<\/p><p>The roadmap was developed following intensive engagement with partners in education, including staff unions, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies and representatives of parents and post-primary students.  This co-operation and collaboration has continued, including at a local level where school communities have worked together to best address their local circumstances.  On Tuesday, officials met with the primary and post-primary stakeholders again to maintain that spirit of partnership regarding school re-opening.  There was also a meeting of the advisory group on the State examinations earlier this week, emphasising the continued co-operation in that area.  There are daily engagements with partners in education and these will continue.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the unstinting and selfless efforts of school communities across the country over the last weeks and months to do all that is necessary to re-open our schools.  We owe a debt of gratitude to all of them for their generosity of spirit, a reflection of their absolute dedication to their students and the provision of education for all.<\/p><p>The roadmap and its accompanying documentation provided schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating the school safely in a Covid-19 context.  Template Covid-19 response plans for schools were also provided to schools.  These plans provide clear and practical guidance and support to schools on the range of measures that need to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely.  The Department has produced age-appropriate guidance for students in the form of animated videos which are intended to help students further understand some of the new routines when they return to school.  Guidance is also available for parents in several languages.  These animations are available at <i>gov.ie\/backtoschool<\/i>and also issued to schools to be disseminated to parents.<\/p><p>The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that all recommendations in the public health advice I published at the beginning of July including physical distancing guidelines as set out in the roadmap still apply in all schools, with the exception of the recommendations on face coverings, which have been updated to reflect the latest research and expertise.  Teachers and post-primary school students should wear face coverings similar to those worn in shops or on public transport when a physical distance of 2 m cannot be maintained.  Guidance for parents, guardians and families on the return to school is available online at <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  Parents and guardians can direct specific queries to their school should they prefer.<\/p><p>A letter was issued to all schools last week, together with a HSE document titled, Schools Pathway for COVID-19, the Public Health Approach.  This document sets out the approach to managing isolated confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the school community and also the principles that will underpin the management of outbreaks or potential outbreaks and the aligned testing strategy within an educational facility.  It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, the HSE's public health department.  All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full public health risk assessment procedure according to the principles set out in the document.  Any actions to be taken by the school will be communicated directly by the HSE's public health department.<\/p> <p>School management will be informed as and when actions such as the exclusion of children or staff, or partial or full closure, are deemed necessary on public health grounds.<br\/><br\/>Children will continue to display symptoms of many other circulating respiratory viruses.  It is known that young children often have a persistent cold.  According to HSE guidelines a child with a blocked or runny nose but no fever can attend school, but if they require paracetamol or ibuprofen they must stay at home for 48 hours and parents or guardians should contact the GP to assess whether a test is required.<br\/><br\/>Students and staff who have symptoms of Covid-19, including fever, new cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, or loss or change to their sense of smell or taste, should not attend school.<br\/><br\/>The definition of close contacts within a school will be variable and determined by a risk assessment that will take account of individual factors within each school or class.  It will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts.  Close contacts will be directly notified by the HSE and advised to restrict their movements and present for testing on day zero and day seven.  Close contacts will restrict their movements for 14 days even in the event that Covid-19 is not detected in both of these tests.  There is no blanket policy to test entire classes or years.  The testing strategy will be aligned to the public health risk assessment, which may recommend widespread swabbing within a class or school under HSE testing procedures.<br\/><br\/>In the event of an outbreak, public health will determine between a range of possible interventions, from exclusion and testing of a small group or pod of pupils up to and including closure of an affected facility.  All schools are required to have a summary of key information to assist public health in its public health risk assessment, ready to be provided on request.<br\/><br\/>Outside the school environment, everyone should follow the latest public health measures announced on 18 August, which are available on <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  Specifically in regard to medically vulnerable children and household members, guidance is published by the HSE.  In the context of achieving physical distancing in schools, schools have reconfigured their available space and have sought to utilise all of the options available to them.<br\/><br\/>I have heard the concerns raised in regard to class sizes in our schools and in our primary schools in particular.  It is important to note that we have seen what is commonly referred to as the pupil-teacher ratio reduce in recent years.  The staffing schedule has undergone a number of changes in the period since 2014.  These changes include the general average pupil number per teacher being reduced from 28:1 to 26:1; the introduction of retention for small schools in 2015; and the changing of retention thresholds for Gaeltacht schools.  The current programme for Government commits to making further progress during the term of this Government on the staffing schedule.<br\/><br\/>I know that school transport is an area of considerable interest to Deputies.  It came up during the Covid-19 committee sessions yesterday.  It was perhaps the issue on which we spent most time yesterday.  The school transport scheme is a massive daily logistical undertaking right across the country and it is worth repeating the numbers involved.  In 2019, more than 120,000 children, including some 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in more than 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering more than 100 million km at a cost of &euro;219 million.  Several Deputies at yesterday's Covid committee hearing raised the area of funding for the operation of the hygiene requirements on school transport vehicles.  A sum of &euro;11.3 million has been allocated for this purpose.  This cost estimate was based on cost per vehicle, based on the number of vehicles on the scheme, and includes a contribution towards the cost of personal protective equipment, PPE, for drivers, enhanced cleaning and sanitising materials and labour, with an estimated cost of &euro;6.1 million for the period from September to December 2020.  For the period from January to June 2021, an estimated &euro;5.2 million will be required for cleaning materials, labour and PPE.<br\/><br\/>The provision includes ongoing monitoring of any additional expenditure for enhanced cleaning requirements or PPE to ensure continued compliance with safety requirements in line with public health advice.  Under the terms of the arrangement my Department has with Bus &Eacute;ireann, it is funded on a cost recovery basis for costs associated with the operation of the school transport scheme.  Therefore, as costs are incurred as a result of the additional hygiene and PPE requirements, they will be included in the bill to the Department for the relevant period.  The Department has not given the sanctioned &euro;11.3 million over to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The costs as they arise will be charged to the Department by Bus &Eacute;ireann as they are incurred.<br\/><br\/>The recently received updated health advice from NPHET does impact on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  The Government decided that the arrangements made for the primary school transport scheme would proceed as planned when schools reopened.  These services are operating fully with additional measures in place, such as preassigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures as already outlined.  The post-primary scheme has also commenced operation with additional measures in place, such as preassigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures on services, and with the rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing in line with those required on public transport, and which is using 50% of passenger capacity on the post-primary services as required.<br\/><br\/>My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so.  Over the coming period, all other post-primary transport services will be reorganised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has returned to the market seeking additional operators to provide services.  I expect to see additional capacity coming on stream over the coming weeks and we are committed to ensuring the public health advice is given effect in the operation of school transport.<br\/><br\/>Deputies will also be aware of my recent announcement which provided for the parents of children who are eligible for transport, but decide not to avail of post-primary transport services, to receive a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements within defined parameters.<br\/><br\/>Deputies will also be aware of the announcement I made this week on calculated grades, which followed a Government decision on proposals I put forward to amend the national standardisation process within the calculated grades model.  Under the calculated grades model, estimated marks from schools will be adjusted, as planned, to ensure a consistent standard is applied across schools throughout the country when judging the performance of students.  The change I introduced removes the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model and places a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students.  Fairness has always been at the heart of the calculated grades model.  The calculated grades process is being used for the first time.  Standardisation will ensure the candidates receiving calculated grades in 2020 are treated fairly and equitably relative to each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300032#FF00200","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599142500,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the Minister as her time has elapsed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300033#GG00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1599142500,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I apologise.

There have been many happy scenes throughout the State of children returning to school and it is a positive thing.  We had our own return to school with our nine year old last Thursday and I must give a lot of credit to the school.  It has been excellent so far.  I acknowledged yesterday, agus d'aithin m&eacute; ar maidin sa chruinni&uacute; a bh&iacute; agam, go bhfuil obair dochreidte d&eacute;anta ag m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; agus boird bhainist&iacute;ochta chun &eacute; seo a eagr&uacute; agus a r&eacute;iteach.  Aithn&iacute;m freisin go bhfuil an-chuid obair d&eacute;anta ag an Aire agus ag foireann na Roinne.  Is ceart agus c&oacute;ir &eacute; sin a r&aacute;.  Of course, while it is one thing to get the schools back it is as great a challenge, if not an even greater challenge, to ensure they remain open.  I put it to the Minister that we have seen case numbers rise in schools in recent days.  It is not our role, and it would be wrong for us to create any undue concern or to whip up any hysteria around that.  It is, however, a reminder that our schools are potentially fragile with regard to remaining open unless the right policies are put in place.  It is vitally important that reassurance comes from the Department.  That reassurance will come from making it very clear that decisive action is being taken and that correct investments and correct policies are being implemented to ensure schools remain open.  It must be a national priority to ensure our children can stay in school safely and sustainably.<\/p>  <p>  While the schools have opened, it is very apparent to everyone involved in the running of schools and to families that there are still significant gaps and shortcomings.<\/p> <p>During August I contacted every primary and post-primary school in the State and of the more than 200 principals that responded, 48.5% felt that they did not have sufficient staff to meet their school's needs, 76% did not believe they would have sufficient access to substitution and 19% felt that they had been left unprepared by the Department's policies.  A full 25% of school principals said that they did not have sufficient classroom space and 22% said they would have to increase the voluntary contributions in response to additional Covid-related costs because they felt the funding they had received would not be adequate.  I have had numerous discussions about the fact that while the funding was enough to reopen schools it would not be enough on an ongoing basis.  There is a concern that principals will have to pass additional costs on to families because they will not have enough funds to provide adequate sanitiser and other equipment to ensure that schools remain clean, hygienic and safe.<br\/><br\/>As far as I am concerned the key priorities for ensuring that schools remain open include rapid, priority testing for students and staff; protecting the jobs and incomes of families whose children have to be kept at home; reducing class sizes which are among the highest in Europe; tackling the teacher shortages; and ensuring that no child is left behind.  I will now go into a bit more detail on those key priorities.  The Minister said publicly yesterday for the first time that there will be priority testing.  There has been confusion on this question and departmental briefings to RT&Eacute; have been contradictory.  Priority testing is absolutely essential and is a crucial element in ensuring that parents are confident that schools are safe and staff are confident that they will be supported and protected.  This needs to happen, with turnaround times of 24 to 48 hours, maximum.  This must be delivered and I ask the Minister to give a timescale on that.<br\/><br\/>We have already had three cases of Covid-19 in schools since the reopening and there could be more today, potentially.  In each of those instances there are hundreds of parents who may have to take time off work to stay at home with their children.  They may not have any paid leave left and may not have an employer who is understanding.  I hope employers will be understanding but that will not be the case in every situation.  I accept that this goes beyond the Department of Education and Skills but in the context of the Minister's priority of keeping the schools open, it is essential that she talks to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection.  It will not be possible for schools to remain open if parents have to make a choice between doing the right thing and keeping their child home because they have symptoms or paying the bills that are mounting up in the context of a threat to their jobs.  That needs to be tackled.  Parents need to be confident that their jobs and income will be protected.  <br\/><br\/>We need to reduce class sizes.  We have the largest class sizes in the EU and one of the largest class sizes in the developed world according to the OECD.  This is what has made reopening our schools so difficult.  We have an underfunded, understaffed and overcrowded education system.  Some school buildings have barely been renovated in the last 30 to 40 years and often there are 30 to 40 children per classroom.  Social distancing in that context is extremely difficult to achieve.  Indeed, many would say it is impossible.  The Department must undertake an urgent audit of school buildings and staff to identify the areas of greatest need, with a specific funding stream set up to ensure that additional space, beyond what is provided through the minor works scheme, can be provided on a rolling basis.<br\/><br\/>We also need to tackle the teacher shortages and there is certainly scope for expanding the hours of teachers who are unemployed.  Finally, no child must be left behind.  I am very concerned about those who lost out most when the schools were closed, namely, children with special educational needs.  Their parents are concerned at being forced to choose between special units and mainstream classes.  They are worried that the special education teachers will be pulled from pillar to post and that their children will not get the support they need.  These children need additional support, not just the<i>status quo<\/i>.  They have lost out significantly and that ground needs to be made up.  If ever there was a time for the children with special educational needs to be a priority for the Department, it is now.  <br\/><br\/>Before handing over to my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, I would point out to the Minister that a solution can be found for those students who sat the leaving certificate last year.  I urge her to find a solution.  I have sent her an email with a number of suggestions.  This needs to be done and it can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300033#GG00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599143100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for appearing at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response yesterday.  At the outset I want to acknowledge all of the hard work that has been done by principals, teachers, caretakers, secretaries and boards of management in all the schools.  I thank them all and wish them well for the future.<\/p>  <p>  I must return to the issue of school transport because I am not sure that the Minister realises the extent of the problem.  There are many children who will not have school transport tomorrow morning or on Monday morning.  I am continuously getting calls from parents about this.  It does not matter to them how clean the buses are if their children cannot get on them.  I am not putting all this at the Minister's door but I am putting it at her party's door because Fianna F&aacute;il destroyed school transport in 2008 when it conducted a review of the system and since then further changes have been made by Fine Gael.  I am shocked that the Green Party does not have a school transport policy which would ensure that every child can get a seat on a school bus.  This nonsense of calling children \"concessionary\" or \"eligible\" has to stop and I ask the Minister to address it.  I welcome information I received from the Ballina office which indicates that the national school buses site will be up and running again from next week.  This needs to happen immediately so that the secondary school applicants are not blocked out.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a survey we conducted recently entitled \"Telling the real story\", in which 73.5% or three out of four young people said they did not have adequate support from their guidance counsellors.  On Monday students will be encouraged to go to their guidance counsellors but if three out of four students have already told us that they did not get an adequate service from their guidance counsellors then we cannot be pushing them in that direction.  The Department must make sure that the necessary resources are provided so students get an immediate response next week.  Guidance counsellors must be there to support students, particularly the 10,200 students who are going to find that their grades are lower than expected as a result of the calculated grades process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300034#HH00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1599143100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Politics can be a difficult and harsh game but we in the Labour Party do not see it as our job to make the Minister feel uncomfortable over the next number of years.  In fact, I want to be in a position to congratulate the Minister as often as I possibly can.  There are certain issues in Irish public policy that go beyond the over and back, Punch and Judy style of politics and education should be one of those.  We are in an historic situation where for the first time in the history of the State there is a question mark over the leaving certificate and over the reopening of schools in September.  I do not believe that happened during the Second World War and am pretty sure that it was the mammoth task the Minister took it to be when she took over her role.  On that basis, the Minister is deserving of congratulations and her Department is deserving of great credit for the fact that the schools are opened and that on the really dangerous part of the assessed grade system, the school profiling, they did listen.<\/p>  <p>  There are two different types of Opposition speeches and politicking.  One is where members come into the Chamber hoping that what they are raising will not be adhered to by the Government because then they can keep complaining about it.  Sometimes they put down an amendment to legislation, hoping that the Government will not adopt it so that they can keep giving out about it.  There is a different type of Opposition where members raise something that they genuinely, earnestly hope that the Government will take on board because it comes from a place of deep concern and understanding.  In fairness to the Minister, we raised the school profiling issue again and again and it was with great joy that we learned a number of days ago that the Minister had listened to the concerns raised and had acted upon them.<\/p> <p>That type of politics does this House some credit and I thank the Minister most sincerely for the moves she has made and for taking on the responsibility of opening up our schools.<\/p> <p> Obviously, there will be issues over the coming months and I know the Minister appreciates that.  We are not going to agree on everything.  Perhaps we will not even agree on most things.  At the same time, if we are determined to work together in some capacity, we might actually achieve some things.<\/p> <p> Many schools were not in a position to tell the true story of the difficulties they had because every school runs on the basis of reputation.  If those running schools start telling the world that the schools cannot open because of lack of space or whatever, it could potentially reflect poorly on them.  Every September many schools are concerned about the numbers necessary to keep teachers and resources etc.  There can be a conspiracy of silence sometimes whereby schools are so determined to keep their reputations going that they will soldier on and not put their heads above the parapet.<\/p> <p> School transport is an issue.  It falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We need a dedicated unit so that Members of the Oireachtas and school boards of management can access a dedicated unit swiftly to get answers to the transport questions arising.<\/p> <p> It has been said that we need not only to open schools but to keep schools open.  The testing regime for teachers, special needs assistants and other school staff, including secretaries and caretakers, has been prioritised by teaching unions and the Minister is responding to this.<\/p> <p> At the briefing earlier today, I raised the issue, as the Minister is aware, of those who are over 16 years of age and, therefore, have no legal requirement to be in school.  I was comforted and satisfied by the answer Department officials gave that the Minister is aware of the issue of the potential for a lost generation of young people, that the Minister is alive to that fact and that resources will be made available to schools to ensure that no young person is lost from the system.<\/p> <p> The final thing I will say on this matter is what Covid-19 has done, as in other areas of the economy and society, is it has ripped open the plaster covering deficiencies in the system, including the relationship between the Department and individual schools, the fact that the Department does not like to engage in the day-to-day management of schools and the amount of autonomy given to school boards of management and patron bodies that really should be part of the role of the Department.  These are historical constitutional matters that I want to raise in the Citizens' Assembly on primary and secondary education.  I know the Minister has committed to that in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p> We are determined to work with the Minister to find solutions.  There has been enough distress, uncertainty, chaos and tears over the leaving certificate and the school system in recent months without politicians adding to it.  We need to talk about the leaving certificate in 2021 and what last year's fifth year, or this year's sixth year, students are going to face.  We must have some recognition in the system of the difficulties they had last year and we need to think of the kind of system we put in place for them.  I hope the Minister takes the Labour Party's bona fides at face value.  We genuinely want to find solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300034#HH00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599143700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>We will go back to the Government side.

I take this opportunity, the first chance I have had, sincerely to wish the Minister well in her role.  It is a very important role and I congratulate her on her appointment.<\/p>  <p>  September is usually an extraordinarily busy time in schools and this September has been no exception.  I recognise the work that schools, teachers, principals, staff and officials in the Department have done to ensure that the schools opened.  I contacted some schools in my area in recent days.  The reports I have been getting back are generally positive, which is a good sign.  Let us hope it continues like that.  Everyone has been working hard to make it happen.<\/p>  <p>  Some issues have arisen.  I know the Minister has been conscious of the needs of vulnerable teachers and medically vulnerable students.  Another issue relates to where there might be a vulnerable family member at home.  There are concerns that in some instances teenagers are coming back into a home where there is someone who is medically challenged and this is causing concern.  Has the Minister addressed this and whether there are mechanisms in place to allow such a student to work from home and maybe use webcam facilities to be virtually present in the classroom?  That is one suggestion.  Several families have been in contact with me and they are concerned about that.<\/p>  <p>  Colleagues have already mentioned the issue of school transport.  It is a major concern.  The concessionary ticket comes up again and again.  Last year, it was a major concern but thankfully extra funding was found to make it go away.  A relatively small amount of money did solve the problem.  Let us put ourselves in the situation of a parent who for three or four years has had a child going to a school under the concessionary ticket regime.  Let us suppose that at the last minute they are told there is no ticket this year.  What do they do?  If both parents are working, how is that family going to cope?  This is a major challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue arises.  I came across one instance involving a family who had paid &euro;170 for the ticket for the year but the actual cost was &euro;175.  They had made a mistake.  They were told they were not getting a ticket because the portal had closed, tough luck.  That kind of inflexibility should not occur.  I ask the Minister to look at the issue of school transport and concessionary tickets.  There are some instances - I know the Minister is aware - in my area, which includes Middleton and Carrigtwohill, which are very close.  If both towns were seen as one education centre for school transport purposes, it would solve many problems in that area.  That may be something the Minister might take on board.<\/p>  <p>  The weight of schoolbooks is something that has come up again and again.  I understand that lockers are no longer being used because of space requirements in schools.  The weight of school bags is a concern.  We need to see whether we can have virtual copies of books and whether the Minister can make available funding to students who need to buy extra laptops, tablets and so on.  That might cut down on the problem.  Over the years we have had debates about the weight of school bags and the damage this can cause to the backs of young children.  Physiotherapists and others have been aware of that.<\/p>  <p>  There has been some concern about the availability of sanitisers and other equipment in schools.  I heard what the Minister said earlier.  She said that would happen and that funding has been made available, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  I heard other colleagues talking about career guidance counselling.  I have some experience of that myself.  I suggest that a guidance counsellor in a school cannot solve every problem.  Every teacher can become the significant adult in the child's life.  Children can be concerned at this time and it is important that they have a listening ear.  I know that professional teachers will make themselves available for that while the guidance counsellor acts as back-up and support in those instances.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for what she has done.  I thank the officials in her Department and the teachers and staff throughout the country.  Let us hope the progress to date continues in a positive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300035#JJ00300","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1599143700,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and congratulate her on the work she has done to date and on guiding the ship through incredibly stormy waters.  She has done a fantastic job.  I thank her and congratulate her on that.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to thank the teachers and principals who have put in enormous effort and work in recent months in preparing their schools for the return of students.  I visited the national school in Inishannon some weeks before the reopening.  The thought-processes, effort and different ways to figure out how they could bring back children in a safe manner were inspiring.  These professionals are there to educate.  That is their passion and first priority.  I thank them for that.<\/p>  <p>  I thank parents as well.  They have had to manage considerable anxiety, worry and excitement as well as their own anxiety.  They have been incredibly understanding for the most part.<\/p>  <p>  I wish good luck to all those students who are still returning to school in a phased manner.  I have many nieces and nephews who are returning to school.  They are absolutely over the moon to be going back to school.  I take this opportunity to wish them the best of luck.<\/p>  <p>  Yet, as we know, with all these processes involved in dealing with the pandemic and this situation, there will always be some issues.  I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of these issues with the Minister.  She might look at these individual issues and come back to me on them.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of school transport will crop up.  There are two sides to this.  On the one side, we have situations where children are unable to avail of tickets or school transport.<\/p> <p>On the other side, we hear stories of situations where buses are at full capacity and there are safety concerns among parents.  To give an example from Glengarriff, not far over the border from the Minister's county, a family have four children, one of whom is attending primary school and has a ticket.  However, of the three children attending secondary school, only one of them has been given a ticket and the other two have not qualified.  I am trying to get my head around this.  The Minister knows Glengarriff is not far from Bantry, which is the secondary school they would attend, but these two children are being told they should attend school in Kenmare, over the border in the Minister's beautiful county of Kerry.  It is an anomaly and these anomalies exist, but we need a system whereby we see fewer of these situations.  I would like the Minister to take that case on board and look into it as similar situations are happening in Drimoleague and other parts of the constituency.<\/p> <p> On the other side of the scale, there is a situation in Belgooly, close to Kinsale, where parents are very concerned because the bus is at its full capacity of 57 students, which flies in the face of what we are trying to do in terms of bringing children back to school safely.  It may be that all of the provisions are being adhered to but, again, it is a concern.  If an extra bus was provided in that area, it would allay many of those concerns and would be much safer.<\/p> <p> There are issues in two local schools in my constituency.  Scoil Bhr&iacute;de in Ballydehob is a lovely national school but it is in a situation where there are three classes in the same classroom, with 28 students and one teacher, and it is appealing for an extra teacher so children can return in much safer numbers.  A case of which the Minister is already aware, and which she has said she will look into, is that of Millie McCarthy, a seven year old child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  Unfortunately, she cannot attend school with her classmates because the class is already well over capacity at 34 students.  Again, for me, the solution is the provision of an extra teacher for that school so the class can be split and Millie, who has underlying health conditions but is desperate to return to school, can return safely.  That is the plea I am making.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister again for the incredible job she is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300035#JJ00400","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599144300,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I want to start by acknowledging the exceptionally difficult job the Minister, her Department and the entire school community have had and will continue to have in ensuring the reopening and functioning of the schools.  It is a job we all need to acknowledge is difficult and we need to work with the Minister and her Department on that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to restate Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s clear position.  We have said all along that we want the schools to open.  We want them to open, in the first instance, in the best interests of children but that must be done in a way that is clearly safe both for the pupils and for staff.  What I would like to do is outline to the Minister the kind of representations that have been made to me by parents, in the first instance, but also by teachers and some principals and members of boards of management in recent weeks, so she can include those considerations in her work in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  While I want to echo the comments of others that there have been many success stories and many very happy moments over the last number of days and weeks, we are also getting representations from parents, teachers and principals who are concerned.  The kind of language they are using with many of us is that there are aspects of the schools reopening programme that they feel are last-minute, that some aspects of the advice are unclear and that, at times, some aspects of the advice are contradictory.  I want to emphasise that point.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of areas where the Government needs to improve its response in the coming period.  The first is the messaging of the public health advice itself.  Probably one of the biggest failures of the Government has been its failure to make very clear to parents and communities why public health advice for the reopening of schools is necessarily different from other settings.  Parents will often say to me that they see us in the D&aacute;il with very significant social distancing but those same rules are not being applied in school settings.  I am not questioning the public health advice and I understand why it is there, but the Government must work harder to convince parents in particular why that is appropriate, is necessary and is what is being done.<\/p>  <p>  We have teachers and principals who are still concerned around the provision of PPE but also about staff levels for permanent teachers, resource teachers, substitute teachers and special needs assistants.  The Minister and the Department need to do much more to reassure schools, principals and boards that all of those resources will be there as needed, particularly in the event, as we have already seen happen, that some teachers or staff have to give up work temporarily to self-isolate or in other circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  While there is absolutely no one-size-fits-all approach, each school has to take the public health guidance and apply it to its school as is most appropriate.  Some members of boards have said to me they feel that in certain instances, they are effectively taking public health decisions.  It is important to recognise the fine line between the flexibility that is required and the requirement that, ultimately, public health decisions are made by public health officials.<\/p>  <p>  I want to finish by reiterating all of the comments that have been made by other Deputies around public transport.  My experience, particularly in parts of Lucan in my constituency, is that there seems to be a lack of co-ordination between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the public transport and private transport providers.  The Minister is aware of the situation in Confey College, affecting my own constituency in Lucan and colleagues in Leixlip, County Kildare, and that still is not resolved.  We also have issues around differing arrangements for children travelling to special needs schools and the concerns parents have, given that in some instances 19 or 20 children are on a bus for up to an hour.  We need greater clarity and greater assurance on resources.  Where the Government and the Minister do the right thing, they will have our full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300036#KK00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1599144300,"counter":186,"content":"<p>We are discussing the reopening of our schools and I would imagine that, all over the country, educators are listening in to what we have to say.  Not only that, they will also be looking at where it is we are saying it.  I want to direct the point not necessarily at the Minister, who has no control over this, but more at the political establishment itself.  We are speaking here in an auditorium with several hundred spare seats and with a distance of 20 m or 30 m between us.  All over the country, there are teachers teaching in classrooms that are overcrowded, placing their health at risk, and we should never step away from that fact.  It looks arrogant and it gives in to the belief that there is one rule for some and other rules for others.  We need to step away from that because we are not demonstrating any leadership.<\/p>  <p>  The reopening of schools was the minimum expectation we should have had as a modern society.  However, one of the things I have been disillusioned by is some of the commentary about the rush on the road to normality, as the Minister put it in her comments.  We know full well what normality looks like for many people in our schools.  Surely we should have a bigger vision than a rush to return to a scenario where we have one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the OECD.  Our normality looks like an antiquated education system that was designed for mid-20th century learning and is now out of date.  Surely, if the Covid pandemic has taught us anything, it is that there should not be any rush to go back to normal.<\/p>  <p>  That lack of ambition for the education system has been compounded by generation after generation of a political establishment that has sought to see our education system as an afterthought.  We need something better.  We need a broader vision of something more substantial and of how we not only bring our children back to education, but how we can educate them in places that are exceptional, in buildings that are suitable, with teachers we are paying appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things I have raised an eyebrow about in the last couple of weeks, particularly the last couple of days, is the very welcome decision to remove calculated grades and the historical parts of that from the leaving certificate results next week.  We are now being told that disadvantaged students will not be disadvantaged as a consequence.  While that is certainly very welcome in the context of the leaving certificate, let me be very clear that, from the very moment a child enters our education system, they are met with an incredible degree of inequality.  A student coming from a poorer household will start primary school with lower language skills.<\/p> <p>We heard yesterday that CSO data show that one in five children in this country is living in conditions of forced deprivation.  Those children go through the same ranks of primary and second level education.  They go through first, second, third, fourth and fifth year at the same level of inequality.  We then expect them to sit the leaving certificate in the knowledge that they are the children who did not have access to a nutritious meal, standard provisions in terms of their clothing such as a warm coat and, in modern times, Wi-Fi access.  These are the children who were at the forefront in terms of tech inequality when students had to remove themselves from class.  This is not fair.<br\/><br\/>Education in this country does happen in isolation.  We cannot separate out the environment in which a child is educated from the system in which he or she is being educated.  It is grotesquely insulting to believe that combating disadvantage in this country stops at the removal of historical grading from the leaving certificate, because it does not.  If the Department of Education and Skills takes the view that child deprivation and poverty has nothing to with it and it takes a hands-off approach in that regard, I disagree with it.  The Minister should not tell us that is fair because it is not.<br\/><br\/>We need a broader vision for what education and combating disadvantage in our schools looks like that extends beyond the realms of us every year enabling a scenario whereby a couple of children squeeze through the ranks and we then convince ourselves that that is okay.  It is not.  Those seeking evidence of this need only look to <i>The Irish Times <\/i>yearly feeder schools list which shows that students who attend private schools or schools in wealthy areas are the ones who get access to the universities, with students in low-income communities being disproportionately impacted by that.  Education, poverty, inequality and disadvantage are intrinsically linked.  We have removed one small component of that to make the situation better, but not to a satisfactory level.<br\/><br\/>I want to speak about fairness, which is an issue that has come up over the past while.  Yesterday, the four unions representing teachers appeared before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  Teachers and schools have done an incredible job.  It is lamentable that some of the public commentary that has taken hold has not been respectful to the role of our teachers, special needs assistants and school secretaries.  I acknowledge the work done by them but I do not want only to acknowledge it.  In every staffroom in this country there is a level of unfairness because some teachers, despite that they are all doing the same job as their colleagues, are being paid disproportionately on the basis of the year in which they commenced teaching.  A vision for education that extends well beyond the rush to return to normality would result in fairness, not only in terms of how we educate our children and the conditions in which they engage in education but how we pay our teachers.<br\/><br\/>Another exceptionally important component of our education system that has come to the fore during the pandemic is our special needs assistants, SNAs.  They are incredibly valuable to society but we are not appreciating them.  If we are to really acknowledge the role of the SNAs in our schools, then over the course of this Thirty-third D&aacute;il, a vision for a better education would be a professionalisation of the SNA community, paying them appropriately, improving their working conditions and standardising the role across schools such that an SNA in one particular school does not have an entirely different role from an SNA in another school.  It is fundamentally important that we have actual vision for education that extends beyond returning to a 20th century antiquated, outdated mode of education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300036#KK00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599144900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Cathal Crowe.  This time last year, Deputy Crowe and I would have been welcoming a class into school.  This is the first September in 15 years that I have not done so.  In the past week, I visited a number of schools in my constituency, from the larger schools such as my own school, Gl&oacute;r na Mara in Tramore, to some of the smaller country schools such as Newtown Junior School, Ballydurn.  I visited one particular classroom in this school that I want to speak about.  There will be countless examples of it throughout the country.  It speaks to some of the work and level of responsibility that the boards of management and principals are taking on at this time.  The classroom in question is a typical country school classroom, which is small and accommodates a fourth-fifth year split class comprised of 34 children, one of whom has special needs.  The principal and the board of management of the school are worried that they will not able to provide for social distancing in the way that they would ideally like to be able to do.  They are worried about the responsibility that they bear and whether they are making a public health decision in allowing the children to sit in that classroom.  They want the support of the Department in making that decision.  It is an awesome burden of responsibility.  At the best of times, being a principal or serving on a board of management in a primary school entails a great deal of responsibility.  These people are looking for backup from the Department such that can feel supported in the decisions they make.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise a second issue, which I raised yesterday at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, namely, grade inflation, but in regard to the 20,000 students who will be bringing 2019 or earlier year results into the CAO system this year.  I will give a specific example.  I know of a constituent who took 2019 to improve on her HPAT results and knows that her current aggregated score would be sufficient to secure her a place on the course she has being trying to get into for the past three years but she is worried that she will miss that boat because of grade inflation this year.  Students in this situation need to be looked after when the next round of CAO courses are announced.<\/p>  <p>  On a different but related issue, namely, leaving certificate 2021 and some of the issues likely to arise, I have reviewed a document from the Department of Education and Skills outlining assessment arrangements for junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations for 2021.  In that document, there is an acknowledgement that we have set out adjusted assessment arrangements for the coming year examination cycle and it states that no centrally prescribed adjustment to the curriculum and course of study would be effective.  We have to accept that point.  It also says that changes can be reviewed as reflected, recognising a loss of learning over time and that provision will be made for additional examination choices.  I have a nagging concern in terms of, in particular, a mathematics course, where if there is a wider range of choices on the examination paper, there may be units of work which are not completed.  It is important that the Department of Education and Skills and the Department for further and higher education, research, innovation and science co-ordinate and get ahead of this problem.  For example, if a student is going into a physics or an engineering course and he or she has not taken time to study functions in the leaving certificate, that needs to be tracked such that there will be no lacuna in that learning when it comes to third level.<\/p>  <p>  I will cede the remainder of my time to Deputy Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300037#LL00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1599144900,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the many principals, teachers and caretakers who have worked tirelessly over the month of August and recent days in particular to get the doors of schools reopened and children back in classrooms so that the learning can begin.  My eldest son, Sam, started junior infants at Parteen national school on Monday morning.  I was delighted the D&aacute;il was not sitting and I could bring him to school.  To see the smiling faces back in the schoolyard of the school in which I taught up to a few months ago was a lovely sight.  It felt like normality was returning to the country.  We all want to see that happen in the best way over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and her Department for the work they have done.  It has not been an easy start for the Minister.  A baptism of fire is definitely a clich&eacute; overused in politics, but that is exactly what the Minister has experienced.  Along with her officials, she has put forward the best possible roadmap to deal with what is happening and will happen in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak briefly about a school in my locality, Meelick national school, which has been mentioned over the past 24 hours in the media as a school that has closed on a precautionary basis due to the Covid pandemic.  There should be no stigmatising of any school.  I take this opportunity to speak on behalf of the local community in saying that we fully believe that it has done what is right.  I am a former pupil and teacher of this school.  The school is following public health guidance.  It is unfortunate that it is the first school in the country to close due to Covid, but there will be many more to follow.  On a rolling basis, we will see classes closing and, probably, schools closing as the next academic year or two gets under way.  Meelick school is doing what it should be doing and I look forward to it reopening next Wednesday and getting back to what it does best.<\/p>  <p>  There are two competing policies that I would ask the Minister to review.  First, there is a requirement on schools, insofar as they can, to adhere to social distancing guidelines, but there is also a requirement on those schools to have in place a plethora of supports for special educational needs.  A number of schools in my constituency have applied for additional teachers based on current or projected enrolments.  They anticipated that the criteria typically used for the sanctioning of new teaching posts would be loosened from the Department's point of view but those posts have not been sanctioned.<\/p> <p>Faced with not having an additional teacher, they have faced a trade-off decision between having 33 or 34 in a class or bringing a teacher out of special education and making him or her an additional mainstream teacher.  They are moving staff around.  They have done that.  I believe it is the right thing and it ensures that classes are smaller and the social distancing principles are adhered to.  Unfortunately, it does not fully fit with the congruency of rules in the Department.  A little bit of clarity there would be appreciated.<\/p> <p> Yesterday I met with the Minister on the fringe of the D&aacute;il sitting to speak about bus transportation in my constituency.  It is certainly a major problem.  I know there is a review under way but I ask that the Minister also deal with the issue of concessionary passes.  I believe this year Bus &Eacute;ireann chose 4 August as a cut-off date for any parent who had not paid up the bus fare, to drop them off the system.  That rule has been there for a long time but was not implemented by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It was not the best of years for it to be implementing it.  There should have been much more flexibility this year given where education is at and given the difficulties families are facing.<\/p> <p> The final thing I want to mention is distance learning.  Many schools have advanced plans but some do not.  I hope the Department can bring us up to speed on this in due course.  An audit is needed of what facilities schools have to deliver distance learning.  Some have local constraints such as lack of broadband while others have fantastic, cutting-edge equipment.  I want to wish all the boys and girls, whether their school will be open for the full year or closing intermittently, the best of health and the same to the teachers as the new school year gets under way.  It is about learning but it is also about staying safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300037#LL00300","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599145500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I welcome the reopening of schools after such a long absence.  I hope they can be kept open even though they are going to be facing many challenges in the coming weeks.  I thank the principals and staff for being proactive in recent weeks in the reopening of our schools.  The concerns of teachers who are in a high-risk category must be heard.  This morning, <i>The Irish Time<\/i>s reported that almost 650 teachers who have been assessed to be high risk have been told that they must go back to school.  This seems an extraordinary move by Medmark.  I believe there has been some movement on this but it will be totally unacceptable if teachers are forced back into a classroom where they do not feel safe.  Many parents who are categorised as high risk share similar concerns.  They are worried about the risk of their children attending school.  I ask the Minister to seek that Tusla clarify the 20 day absence rule and that some common sense is used in allowing flexibility in these uncertain times.<\/p><p>The issue of class sizes has been raised a lot.  It is important to highlight the impact of decades of under-funding which is leading to some of our children being crammed into tight spaces where social distancing is not an option.  Student-teacher ratios here are among the highest in Europe and this is a measure of how the failure to fund our schools has had a negative effect.  The lack of isolation spaces in schools is not good enough.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to support schools in identifying appropriate spaces where children can isolate.  Schools in my constituency contacted me last week because they had no supply panel in place for Dublin 17.  This has since been sorted but it speaks to how the concerns of many schools have not been addressed by the Department in recent weeks.  Communication has not been great and this needs to change if our schools are to be kept open.  Rapid testing must be prioritised for students and staff who present with symptoms.  I ask the Minister to make a commitment to introduce rapid testing as a matter of urgency.  <\/p><p>As elected representatives, it is vital that we all look at the weeks ahead and present a united front, that Opposition spokespeople who have concerns are listened to and that their proposals will also be heard.  I really believe it is important that Deputies across this House are kept up-to-date on any developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300038#MM00200","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speech","time":1599145500,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry.  This is the first debate in which I have spoken under the new speaking rules and what an attempt it is to muzzle the Opposition.  By the time we get to speak for five minutes the Government has spoken for 32 minutes.  By the time our slot comes up, instead of four slots before us there have been eight.  By the time some of the other Opposition groups get to speak for five minutes, the Government will have spoken for a total of 60 minutes.  No wonder they tried to drive this process through without regard for the opinions of many people in here.  For that reason, it simply will not be accepted.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of teachers at high risk, it is really scandalous that at this stage 650 teachers at high risk have been instructed by Medmark, a private company employed by the Department, a gun for hire, to go back to school.  These are not people with a cold or minor problems.  These are people with serious diseases such as cancer, kidney failure and substantial underlying conditions.  In some cases, they have received advice from their doctors or consultants that they cannot safely return to work.  There was one case referred to of a teacher who had acute leukaemia, type 2 diabetes, asthma, anaemia and an autoimmune disorder and Medmark said they should go back to work despite their doctor telling them they were not able to.  It is simply not acceptable.  Anybody whose doctor is telling them it is not safe to go back to work should not be put in this position, particularly by a private corporation dictating that they do so.<\/p>  <p>  I have been raising for months with the Minister and have had written correspondence with her and her predecessor on the issue of school buses.  It has been largely unnoticed and unremarked upon in the media that there has been a widespread cut of school bus services across Dublin.  At a time when we need more buses, the school bus service has been scrapped entirely.  For at least three schools in my constituency, St. Mac Dara's, Tallaght community school and St. Paul's secondary school, the bus run is being scrapped entirely and the answer is that the students should just take the regular bus.  That is not a runner for people and the cut needs to be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300038#MM00300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1599145500,"counter":193,"content":"<p>The Minister said in her opening remarks that the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced in recent years.  That is true, but the point is that it has not been reduced nearly enough.  We have 100,000 students in classes of more than 30 according to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO.  We have a pupil-teacher ratio of 25:1 in primary school when the European equivalent is 20:1.  Teaching takes place in bigger classrooms in Europe.  Here, the largest classroom size is 49 sq. m and there may be a few in recent years of 55 sq. m.  It is not uncommon in Europe to have a classroom size of 100 sq. m.  It is no surprise that the Teachers Union of Ireland says that even 1 m social distancing cannot be achieved in some schools.  We need a pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 and to achieve that we need to up the ante with spending on prefabs for the schools and then school buildings as soon as possible after that.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers suffering from heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, cancer, obesity and weak immune systems are being instructed by Medmark to go and teach in classes.  Medmark says they are high risk but not very high risk.  The World Health Organization makes no such distinction.  There should be no such distinction in terms of health and safety for teachers going back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090300038#MM00400","speaker":"1522"}]
