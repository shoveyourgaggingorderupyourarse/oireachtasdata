The Taoiseach denied this policy was in place and stated the opposite was the case.  This week, my party tabled a Private Members' motion specifically on the policy of cutting back and withdrawing discretionary medical cards.  Since 2011, the number of such medical cards in the system has declined from more than 80,000 to 54,000.  With more than 1,000 discretionary medical cards being withdrawn per month, the number of these cards will have declined to 50,000 by the end of the year if the Government's policy continues.<\/p><p>  Last evening, Deputies raised various cases.  I received a letter at the weekend outlining the case of an eight year old child with Down's syndrome, chronic asthma, two severe skin conditions, sight difficulties and bilateral hearing loss who also needs a wide range of therapies, orthotics and so forth.  This gives rise to extraordinary costs, including a significant number of medical prescriptions and, at a minimum, 15 general practitioner visits each year.  The young child's discretionary medical card has been withdrawn, despite the fact that the family's means have reduced since the card was first issued in 2005.  The only reason I raise this case among many others is to illustrate that there has been a consistent policy of withdrawing discretionary medical cards from people who are chronically ill. <\/p><p>  Last evening, Deputy Kelleher raised a case involving a young child of six years with highly complex medical issues, including hospital stays and so forth, whose medical card was, incredibly, withdrawn.  People do not understand how the Taoiseach and Ministers can state in the House that this is not happening.  Will the Taoiseach change heart and stop this policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900003#A00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1381311000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The position is that when this Government was elected discretionary medical card applications were not routinely assessed by medical personnel.

Discretionary medical cards are awarded to people who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for themselves and their families.

I will not name the person who wrote it but if the Taoiseach reads it, he will see that what I have said is the truth.  He should ask Deputies where the issue of discretionary medical cards rates as a percentage of the cases they receive.

The Taoiseach should read the letter dated 23 September and instruct the authorities to stop using the term &quot;undue hardship&quot;.  The woman who wrote the letter states she received a letter from the authorities indicating the withdrawal of the discretionary medical card would not cause her family &quot;any undue hardship&quot;.  &quot;I beg to differ&quot;, she writes.

Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The number of individuals who had eligibility to a medical card or a GP visit card on a discretionary basis on 1 January in 2009 was 93,000 and 78,000 in 2013.  As I said, 22,584 have moved on to full medical cards.  In cases of emergency situations, the HSE has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care they cannot afford.  I think that is clear.  The HSE issues emergency cards to such people within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter of confirmation of their condition from a doctor or medical consultant.  I think that is pretty clear.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card because of his or her circumstances and the application is followed up with a full application by that person in due course.<\/p><p>  Where a person is terminally ill, a slightly different category is applied.

I invite every Deputy, including Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, to send the Taoiseach the list we have for him to review.  I appeal to him to listen to what is being said.  I especially appeal to him regarding the Government's austerity policy.  He spoke about changed social circumstances.  There are greatly changed social circumstances because austerity has not worked and is not working.  The budget offers a chance to change that and the Government should use the budget to turn the ship and protect citizens as opposed to following the diktat of the European leaders or, indeed, the Taoiseach's own ideological position.<\/p><p>  T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;or cinnte go dtuigeann an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas gurb iad an lucht oibre, gn&oacute;tha&iacute; beaga, me&aacute;n gn&oacute;tha&iacute; agus teaghlaigh na daoine at&aacute; ag fulaingt mar gheall ar an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im, g&eacute;arch&eacute;im n&aacute;r chruthaigh siad sa ch&eacute;ad &aacute;it.  The Taoiseach knows the people on the live register did not create the crisis.  The 300,000 citizens forced to emigrate did not create the crisis.  The growing number of citizens awaiting hospital treatment did not create the crisis, nor did the citizens who are denied medical cards.  However, they are carrying the burden.  This will be the seventh austerity budget if the Government, as appears likely, does not listen to people such as those on these benches.  It has taken &euro;30 billion out of the economy.  The people need a break.  In his heart of hearts the Taoiseach must know that.  He must know that people cannot bear the awful punitive measures that are being forced upon them.  The budget could reduce the tax burden on ordinary families, protect public services and invest in jobs.  That would be a thought.  The Government could actually invest in jobs to get people back to work.<\/p><p>  I understand the Economic Management Council is meeting this evening to take its final decisions on the budget so there is still time.<\/p><p>There is still time to look back over the past two and a half years and the role of the last Government before that.  This is the seventh austerity budget.  If it is not working, why does the Government keep doing it?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to face the economic reality that austerity is not a sound policy and, probably more important, the social consequences of this policy, and move away onto a more enlightened course?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900004#B05100","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381312200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will present his third budget to the House next Tuesday.  The Economic Management Council will meet today but the Government, the Cabinet, has not and will not sign off on the details of the budget affecting every Department until some time before next Tuesday.<\/p><p>  The mandate given to the Government, made up of the two parties of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, was to fix our public finances in a way that will allow for us as a country and as a people to exit the bailout later this year and, second, to accelerate the number of new jobs that are created to provide growth in the economy and hope and confidence for families who either have unemployment or are on very average incomes.  They are the two steps involved in the presentation of the Minister's third budget.  That is why the framework for the budget for next week has been agreed and accepted by the troika in Brussels as presented here with a change in emphasis from &euro;3.1 billion to &euro;2.5 billion.<\/p><p>  I note that the budgetary submission sent in by the Sinn F&eacute;in party also has a reduction of &euro;2.5 billion.  I am unsure how Deputy Adams relates that to the charges he has just made.  We are now in the 15th consecutive month of reductions in the live register.  It is very important, as the Minister pointed out, that there be a primary surplus to help us to start reducing debt and to meet our targets, because that sends out an international signal to investment markets of the continued capacity of Ireland to meet its targets and the continued capacity to be recognised as a location for strong investment, which brings about competitiveness, which is always followed by investment in jobs.<\/p><p>  The ESRI report indicates the potential to have 3% growth in GNP next year and 2% in GDP.  If that can be reached it carries serious potential in terms of jobs.  I note the comment from Commissioner Rehn in respect of the European Commission endorsing the position taken by the Government as we move to present this budget and, later in the year, as we move out of the bailout programme.<\/p><p>  While the crisis was not caused by any of the people Deputy Adams mentioned, the difficulties and the challenges that the Government has had to face take into account the concerns we have about so many families and ordinary people who have had to put up with this for so many years.  That is why the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will present his budget in the fairest and most equitable way that the Government can, given the constraints upon us and, at the same time, allow for the capacity for investment and for jobs to be created in schools, roads and capital infrastructure, following on the stimulus package announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform last year and this year and in the context of the capital programme between now and 2015.<\/p><p>  Our targets and objectives are set and we have achieved them to date.  We expect to continue to do that and to exit our programme this year and, between now and the coming years, move to a position where the mindset that applied some years ago will never return.  The aim is that we can have put in place safeguards such that whatever happens our country will not slip back into that mentality.  That is why the independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and all the other opportunities to prevent that happening are important.  We recognise the challenge the Government faces.  The Government, the Cabinet, as a cabinet, will make its decisions finally before the Minister presents his budget next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900005#C00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The mandate the Government received was not to do the things it is doing, it was to do them differently from the last Government.  The people listening in to Leaders' Questions will be very disappointed and depressed.  The Taoiseach says Commissioner Olli Rehn is happy.  Is that how the Government judges its policy, if Olli Rehn says it is good?  It gets a pat on the head.  What about the people that we have just talked about, those who, the Taoiseach acknowledges, because he could not do anything else, did not create the crisis?  The Taoiseach has cited that we are looking for an adjustment in the deficit in our budget proposals which is the same as the Government's, and that is true, but he asks what the difference is.  T&aacute; difear m&oacute;r ann.  It is about who carries the burden.  We have not seen this budget but if we go by the past number, they were very unfair and mean and they placed the burden upon working people, small businesses and all those who, the Taoiseach freely acknowledges, did not create the crisis.  There is the big difference; our budget is fair and tries to lift the burden of those who cannot bear another austerity budget.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach keeps talking about growth projects but the Government does not deliver.  There is zero growth this year.  Why does the Government not increase the respite care grant for carers?  Why does it not provide the &euro;12.58 million needed for bilateral implants for profoundly deaf children?  The Taoiseach spoke about listening.  I have talked to the Taoiseach about that issue on at least four occasions, I have given him two notes on it, I have written him formally on three or four occasions and I have talked to the Minister for Health on the issue as well.  Young profoundly deaf children in this State are given one implant.  It is like giving a blind child one eye.  Every other state puts in two cochlear implants and the HSE recognises that this is best practice.  That is something the Government could do.  Why does the Government not take the approximately 300,000 citizens out of the universal social charge net?  That is something else the Government could do.  Why does the Government not invest in jobs, particularly for young people?<\/p><p>  If the Taoiseach is determined to stick with austerity - there is still room to change - I appeal to him to explore with us the social consequences.  If the Taoiseach acknowledges, as he has done quite freely, that the litany of citizens who are under great pressure did not create the crisis, then what will another budget do to them, especially if they are already in distress, scattered throughout the globe, on the dole queues or on the waiting lists?  What are the social consequences?<\/p><p>  As for those in the Labour Party, I appeal to them to wake up to the reality of what they said they would do in government and what they are actually doing in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900005#C00400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams should come into the real world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900005#C00500","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>It is all down to the bank guarantee that Sinn F&eacute;in voted for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900005#C00600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams and his party contributed to the wrecking of the economy of this country, North and South, for 30 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900005#C00700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Along with a few other things as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900005#C00800","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams should understand clearly that this Government has made the decisions with the people that it has made.

She had never written to a politician previously but was desperately seeking help and, with her permission, I am raising her case in the Chamber today because she represents thousands of other people who are suffering a similar torment.  More importantly, I am raising it because the Taoiseach has the ability to sort out this issue.  She told me that she was trying to locate her daughter, who had been born to her in Castlepollard mother and baby home in 1966 and to whose adoption she had never consented.  She had been sick after the birth and was in bed on the morning of St. Patrick's Day, when her child was a couple of months old.  She was told by the priest and the matron that the child had been adopted and was told to get up and go to mass.  No papers were signed and no permission was given.  This woman eventually moved on with her life, had four other children and got married.  For the past 30 years, she has been trying to find her daughter.  She contacted the Sacred Heart nun Sister Sarto, who was the order's search and trace co-ordinator.  There were letters, telephone calls, meetings and excuses to the effect that her letter was not received or the order did not have the information.  She was told her daughter's adoptive family did not wish to know her or to have anything to do with their.  Her request became more urgent when both she and one of her other children twice developed cancer and she wanted her daughter to be aware of her medical history.  Even that did not help and she was begging for assistance.<\/p><p>  I contacted the Adoption Rights Alliance, which is a voluntary organisation of activists and campaigners, many of whom were born in mother and baby homes and themselves were adopted, and with which I had worked on such cases previously.  Last Friday, I received a call from Mr. Paul Redmond of Adoption Rights Now! to tell me that the organisation had found and spoken to her daughter, who was absolutely delighted and was looking forward to meeting her mother.  A 30-year search was ended within ten days because of a random correspondence with a Deputy.  While being absolutely glad for those concerned, I was boiling mad because the Adoption Rights Alliance did not find that information by chance.  This case proves positively that the information was always there but individuals and organisations consciously and deliberately withheld it from those who had a right to know.  That is a crime and it is landing on top of the other crime that not only was that child illegally adopted, but it also was found out that the birth had been registered as a legal adoption, which was not the case.<\/p><p>  There is no reason this should have happened or why this woman should have been obliged to endure such things.  Unfortunately, however, there are thousands of others going through the same thing.  In reply to a parliamentary question earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, confirmed to me that 25,000 files from the Sacred Heart mother and baby homes were in the hands of the Health Service Executive, HSE, in Glanmire, County Cork.  Given the time importance in this regard, will the Taoiseach meet the Adoption Rights Alliance, which has proven its credibility and credentials in this matter, to discuss the establishment of an emergency task force to enable the thousands of people searching for their basic human right to an identity to secure it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900006#D05000","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I listened to the story recounted by Deputy Clare Daly and I am glad it has worked out in this particular case.  I think the Deputy mentioned the child was born in 1966, which would mean she now is 47.  I am unsure whether that women was actively seeking her mother or her mother actively looking for her.  Clearly, this was a good ending to a long-running saga in which a mother was looking for her natural born baby.  As for the figure of 25,000 people, I do not know how many of that number, mothers or children, are actively looking for one another.  I will ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to meet the alliance - I do not know whether such a meeting already has taken place - to ascertain if what the Deputy has outlined is true in respect of other cases.  Clearly, the position has changed and people are entitled to find their natural parents and <i>vice versa<\/i> and that might be a useful engagement.  I regret that it has taken a situation for the Deputy to raise it here on Leaders' Questions but it is an important, sensitive and personal issue and I am glad the Deputy's involvement has brought about this meeting and this acquaintance between mother and daughter.  Perhaps I will ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to meet Deputy Daly to discuss these and other cases, as well as meeting the adoption alliance to ascertain whether a structured openness can be put in place to enable these things to happen when people want them to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900006#D05100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>While it obviously is a happy ending in this case, the reason the woman concerned gave me permission to raise her case in this Chamber is that, sadly, there are thousands of others where the ending is not so happy.  People have spent a lifetime searching only to find out perhaps that the parent had just recently died.  This simply is not good enough.  In September 2011, the Minister told me that the heads of the Bill on the new adopting and tracing legislation were close to completion and would be progressed fairly speedily.  In July 2013, she told me that she hoped to bring the heads of the Bill as early as possible but the legislative programme states Members might get it in 2014.  In September 2011, the Minister told me that the Sacred Heart files had been transferred to Glanmire and a system was in place to manage and help people to get the records.  In September 2013, she told me that the 25,000 files had been transferred to Cork, that there was a significant demand to access these files and as a result, sadly, the HSE was not in a position to respond but that it was planning to reorganise its approach to dealing with the matter.<\/p><p>This is not good enough.  This knowledge has been in the Government's hands for a long time.  These are crimes that have been committed against people from whom their identities have been withheld.  What I asked the Taoiseach for was not only a meeting.  Some people who were illegally adopted recently met the Minister.  What they want is action.  They have proved that they can play a part in assisting to match people with their parents because of their own experience.  Why not bring them to the heart of this matter and get them involved in sorting out what is demonstrably a crisis in people being able to access their files?

If people are entitled and eligible to access those files, where that is appropriate, it is obvious that a structure needs to be put in place where that can happen.  The Deputy mentioned that there is very healthy demand from people to access the files and I assume that is a demand from people who want to access them for the purpose of finding or tracing their children or parents, as the case might be.

There was considerable debate on Committee Stage about Deputy Moynihan's amendment which had a good deal of support and for that reason, I did as I was requested and drafted an amendment which is before Deputies as amendment No. 1.<\/p><p>  On Committee Stage, Deputy Moynihan proposed that a new section 30 be inserted to provide that within 12 months of enactment of this Act, a report be brought forward by me, as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, providing a value for money assessment of the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business.  On Committee Stage, I undertook to try to accommodate the Deputy.  Deputy Naughten's amendment No. 6 proposes that within two months of the disposal of the energy company, a report should be laid before each House detailing the plans for the allocation of the proceeds arising from the sale.<\/p><p>  Having reflected on the need for accountability in this matter and in order to accommodate the Deputies, I propose amendment No. 1 which proposes that a new provision be inserted after section 2(3).  The amendment has been drafted following discussions between my Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I am of the view that accountability should extend beyond the sale transaction itself and that a better outcome will be achieved by acceptance of amendment No. 1.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, the new D&aacute;il reform package includes a post-legislative report whereby a Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas select committee within 12 months of enactment to review the functioning of the Act.  This will allow for the committee to consult with civil society groups and individuals with expertise in the relevant area.  Accordingly, the amendment I propose provides that within 12 months of the commencement of Part 2 of the Act, a wide-ranging report on the operation of the Act will be prepared and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The report will cover developments over the previous year and will include information on the formation of the network company, the approval of any network transfer plan, the approval of any transfer to an energy company, the disposal of any energy company and the appointment of the majority shareholding Minister.<\/p><p>  Section 29 of the Bill provides that the sale of the energy business is subject to the consent of myself, as Minister, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In consenting to any sale, I can assure the Deputies that we will be firmly focused on ensuring the State receives fair value from the transaction.  This is particularly important because following much negotiation, it has been agreed with the troika that the proceeds of this asset disposal programme will be used to fund employment enhancing projects.  This will include funding for the Exchequer element of the infrastructure stimulus package, which the Government announced in July 2012.  Spending on infrastructure stimulus and other Exchequer capital projects is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is not a matter which is amenable to specific reporting under this Bill.<\/p><p>  I found the debate on Committee Stage on this point very useful and the arguments advanced persuasive.  The Deputies' input and proposed amendments contributed to my proposed amendment on this matter and have significantly enhanced the accountability framework for the operation of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900009#G01600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the inclusion of this amendment.

I am glad he has listened to the arguments that were made on Committee Stage.  It is fair and reasonable for us to acknowledge that here.  Far too often, Ministers are not prepared to take on board constructive suggestions that are put to them.  I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has done so on this occasion.  However, he knows that his amendment does not address the issue I have been raising.  He has argued that his Department is not responsible for this aspect of the issue.  This is the only opportunity we have to make any kind of provision with regard to the issue.  This is the last time we will discuss the proposed sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister's predecessor was presented with a report from the Western Development Commission that dealt specifically with the problem of the provision of gas to the north west and the west midlands.<\/p><p>  I will explain what I find hard to fathom.  In fairness to the Minister, he has tried to be proactive in the case of the issue of broadband.  I appreciate that many challenges have arisen in that regard.  I hope we will soon see an initiative which will resolve many of this country's problems in that area.  The Minister was proactive in dealing with the issue of market failure in that instance.  He put incentives and financial supports in place.  The significant challenge that the north west is facing with regard to gas - we cannot get gas into the region in the first place - also results from market failure.  Some towns were marginally outside the eligibility criteria when the Commission for Energy Regulation conducted its restrictive cost benefit analysis.  The Minister told us on Committee Stage that he is taking a hands-off approach to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  He said he will not go near the commission to ask it to review its policy on conducting its evaluations.  In other words, the people of the north west will have to wait for gas.  The only other way we might be able to get gas is to hope the fracking industry, which has such a bad reputation in the United States, starts to do some fracking in the north west.  I do not think that type of gun should be put to the heads of those involved in businesses and communities in the region.  As citizens of this State, they have a right to access natural gas.<\/p><p>  I spoke recently to an employer whose business, which is based in Roscommon town, is a high energy user.  He told me that the energy costs of his business are 40% higher than those of businesses based in adjoining towns like Athlone and Mullingar or in the city of Galway, all of which have access to gas.  The non-availability of natural gas is having a major impact not only on the viability of existing jobs in our region, but also on the potential for future jobs.  The introduction of a carbon tax will undermine the financial viability of many of those businesses, which are trying to compete with other businesses in this country.  I welcome the fact that employment has thankfully started to increase.  As the Minister knows, the difficulty is that the increase in employment is centred on the Dublin catchment area.  There is very little activity outside Dublin and the other cities.<\/p><p>  The provision of gas would help to stimulate the creation of construction jobs and long-term manufacturing jobs in my region.  I made the point on Committee Stage that the extension of the gas line to towns in the region would lead to an annual financial benefit of approximately &euro;16.5 million for businesses in the region.  It would also have an impact on job creation.  The only opportunity we have - the Minister has ruled out every alternative - is to ring-fence for this purpose some of the funds generated from the disposal of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  It is within the Minister's control and competency to ask the Commission for Energy Regulation to re-examine the criteria and consider the issue of balanced regional development.  Many of the 2,000 people who are leaving this country every week are moving away from my part of the country.  Many communities are unable to field GAA teams because so many young people have departed.  This problem is not confined to young people.  I raised this sad aspect of the emigration issue during the summer.  Whole families are leaving the region because they do not see any future or long-term hope that would encourage them to remain in this country.<\/p><p>  There is a great deal of blue-chip foreign direct investment in my region, thankfully.  I refer to companies like Abbott, which has facilities in Longford and Sligo.  Such companies need to be able to access the gas network if they are to sustain the jobs they are providing into the long term.  If the Commission for Energy Regulation continues to sit on its hands, the only mechanism available to us is to ring-fence some of these funds for this purpose.  It is not possible for me to table an amendment that would have financial consequences, as the Minister so eloquently explained on Committee Stage.  I have tabled an enabling amendment that places a responsibility on the Government to come back within two months of the disposal date of this asset, outlining how it intends to spend the proceeds from the said disposal.<\/p><p>  I do not think I am asking for too much when I call on the Government to explain and justify how it intends to distribute this money.  It will have to tell the European Commission how it intends to spend this money.  However, the Minister is unwilling to legislate to ensure the elected Parliament of this country will have an opportunity to discuss this matter.  I believe a commitment to revert to this House in this regard - to outline exactly how these moneys are being spent - should be laid down in statute.  I would like to hear why these funds cannot be used to expand the gas network.  This is our only opportunity to ensure gas is brought into a region that is haemorrhaging people at the moment.  Communities are being decimated by emigration.  This is an example of a definitive action the Government can take in support of balanced regional development.  It would show that the Government wants people, investment and sustainable jobs to come to the region and stay there for the long term.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision and accept my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900010#H00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1381315200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Deputies will notice that there are no Report Stage amendments in my name.  I submitted four amendments prior to Committee Stage, but they were ruled out of order because they were deemed to be in conflict with the principles of the Bill.  I understand that ruling.  I tabled the amendments in an effort to mitigate the worst consequences of this legislation.  Given that I believe this legislation is fundamentally wrong, it is natural that the amendments were in conflict with the principles of it.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, knows this in his heart.  At a time when the State is almost bankrupt, it is proposed to sell off one of the few State-owned, taxpayer-funded assets that is making money.<\/p><p>Why are we doing this?  It is to pay off bankers and their allies.  On the Second Stage debate at the Oireachtas Select Sub-Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on 1 October the Minister said, \"We have never had a forced sale in these circumstances since 1922\".  He is right.  I have no doubt that were it three years ago and he was sitting over here, he would vigorously and rightly call on Government to stand up to the financial bullies and to seek to have the Bill thrown out.  We cannot make good legislation out of bad legislation by amending a line here and a section there.<\/p><p> Deputy Naughten's amendment calls for a gas pipeline for the north west.  He is right - we must have that.  The situation is unfair and unjust.  If one looks at any infrastructural map they would see that the north and north west is deprived and that we do not have an infrastructure that allows us to compete with the rest of the nation.  Businesses and householders are at a serious disadvantage because of the lack of access.  Let me be clear, lest anyone be in any doubt about my position: the people of the west and north west will not be bribed or bullied into allowing fracking in the region in return for any gas pipeline.  Our right to access gas stands as a right.  We will not allow that to be used as a trade-off and for the region to be destroyed by allowing hydraulic fracturing.  That will not happen under my watch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900010#H00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381315800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to give my full support for Deputy Naughten's amendment.

It makes sense that the Minister should be in a position to outline in a report before each of the Houses the plans for the allocation of the proceeds of the said disposal.  He might not have destinations for the entire proceeds, but Deputy Naughten's suggestion that much of it should be ring-fenced for the north west region is imperative, and that could be expressed, with the balance to be further considered and decided on.  It is an opportunity to identify and declare where certain amounts of the proceeds should go.  That would be good for psychology and the uplifting of the hearts and minds of people in the region.  That is important because we would see breaks in the sky in the general depression that has overcast the country for so long, and those breaks in the sky would bring encouragement and energy to people in their homes and places of work.  I would commend such an approach.

The report will laid before both Houses and it is for the Whips to agree when to roster it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten took the opportunity to set out again the arguments why it is important his region accesses the gas network and for industrial development in particular.  I fully appreciate his arguments.  I met the Western Development Commission following the publication of the report.  I have a great deal of sympathy for the arguments set out.  The problem is that, as Deputy Naughten knows, a system has been in place since, I think, 2002, whereby decisions to extend the natural gas network are made on the basis of economic viability tests.  The north west region has not been deemed to meet those tests.  That is being reviewed all the time and there are new applications all the time.  For example, earlier this year Midleton was connected up.  It was also agreed that Nenagh would be connected after a re-examination which, if my sources are correct, was based largely on the needs of a large employer, which played a significant factor in the economic assessment of whether it would be viable.  The same consideration was made in Wexford town.<\/p><p>  It is not, alas, a case of ring-fencing funds to enable the installation of the national gas network; rather, it is a question of the economic viability of the gas link.  As things stand, a regulatory model assesses viability, and the model must apply unless the House decides to drive a coach and four through it.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  If there were a major employer sourced in one of the towns that Deputy Naughten has in mind, that would likely change the economic assessment of that town.  <\/p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation, which is a statutory, independent body, has since 2002 been charged will all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and or operate a gas distribution system.  The legislation that underpins these powers is the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have no direct statutory function on the connection of towns to the gas network. <\/p><p>  The regulator in 2006 approved a new network connections policy which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  The policy was reviewed in 2011.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The regulator policy ensures that the costs of connecting a town or a group of towns to the network are recouped over a certain period through the economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs, otherwise uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.<\/p><p>I cannot be unmindful of that last point either.  That is the system that has been operating.  It is a dynamic situation.  There have been decisions pretty much every year to connect new areas of the country depending on the economic criteria.  I appreciate the arguments being advanced, but as Deputy Naughten admitted, it is not to do with this Bill but is an opportunity to ventilate the questions he has raised.  The question of whether we want to revisit the 2002 Act is a separate question.  If the issue is that it is no longer fit for purpose, that is a different question.  Most people would accept that the business of us agreeing to connect the entire country, even where it would be manifestly economically unviable to do so, would drive up the cost of energy for all users.<\/p><p> Deputy Colreavy opposes the Bill.  I respect that because it is his right to do so.  However, we went through this on Committee Stage and I cannot agree that selling the energy business of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is in any way a blow to the national interest.  Rather, I see the energy business growing in the future while the development of Irish Water under the aegis of Bord G&aacute;is will see more people employed by Bord G&aacute;is than ever before.  That is happening as we speak.  Whoever buys the energy company, one would expect that new investment will be brought in and jobs expanded in that company in the future.<\/p><p> Given the circumstances in which we find ourselves where we do not have an alternative in terms of the deal done on the bailout and the injunction on us from the troika, we do not really have a choice but to proceed with the sale.  Deputy Colreavy is probably right to express his opposition to the Bill rather than seek to amend it because he agreed on the last occasion that his amendments did seek to oppose exactly the relevant sections of the Bill, which is fair enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900011#J00500","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381316400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>My apologies to the Minister.

We should use our imagination and harness the resources.  They will be there and, as Deputy Naughten says, it is an investment.  The marginal decision not to proceed on the basis of &euro;1 million for one town and &euro;1 million for another is not on.  We should say that we will scrap that sum and use our imagination to produce the economic activity that will more than pay for itself and will in turn stop the chicken-and-egg negativity and produce chicken-and-egg positivity.  There will be chickens and eggs rather than a paralysis.  I ask the Minister to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900012#K00900","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1381316400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten is being a bit unfair to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900012#K01000","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1381316400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Tough love.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900012#K01100","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1381316400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I did not say anything about what I would not do.

The memorandum of understanding agreed in November 2010 between the then Government and the EU, IMF and ECB committed to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of State-owned assets.  Following lengthy and tough negotiations with the troika, the current Government has been able to agree a position whereby the quantum of disposals of State assets is smaller than the troika initially demanded.  The proceeds will be used to assist in economic recovery and key strategic assets, such as the gas transmission and distribution systems, will be retained in State ownership.  In order to deliver on our troika commitments and, more important, to fund our programme for jobs and economic recovery, we must proceed with the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  I cannot accept an amendment that seeks to delete section 29, which provides for the company to sell its energy business subject to ministerial consent.<\/p><p>  As critical national infrastructure, the Government has committed to retaining the gas network in State ownership.  In doing so, it is incumbent on us to ensure this important business remains well funded, with an investment grade credit rating, so that it can continue to invest and provide dividends to the State as shareholder.  The Government will, therefore, ensure an appropriate gearing level in the network business following the sale.  This is not a matter amenable to provision in primary legislation.  While the attempt to do so may be well intentioned, it could preclude the ability to borrow to fund necessary infrastructure investment.  That would not assist the company or deliver security and value to energy consumers and citizens.<\/p><p>  However, while I am not able to accept the amendment, I assure Deputy Moynihan that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I will keep the matter under review and we will take the advice of our officials and the NewERA shareholder executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900013#L00400","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1381317000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I am disappointed the Minister is not in a position to tease out the issues in regard to debt and I am pressing the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900013#L00500","speaker":"987"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381317000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381317000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1381317000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote>In page 16, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:&#8220;30.

As the Minister, I am regularly updated by the regulator on developments and the state of competition.  I have no statutory function in regard to the regulation of either the electricity or gas market.  Responsibility for their regulation is a matter for the regulator, which is an independent statutory body.  The functions of the regulator include protecting the interests of final customers, including the disadvantaged and the elderly.  The regulator is also responsible for promoting efficient, orderly, fair and competitive markets and for monitoring competition.<\/p><p>  Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated.  Prices in the gas market are also deregulated, with the exception of gas prices charged by Bord G&aacute;is Energy to its domestic customers.  Therefore, customers can avail of competitive offerings from suppliers.

It will, I believe, prove to be the most important Bill introduced into this House during the lifetime of the Government in the provision of assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of serious crime and identifying serial offenders across a broad range of areas, including homicide, rape, sexual and other serious assaults and burglary.  The Bill not only provides for the establishment of a DNA database to assist the Garda in the investigation of serious crime but will also assist in finding and identifying missing or unknown persons.  It will also play a crucial role in the investigation of what have become known as cold cases, the identification of perpetrators and their being brought before our courts.  In addition, it will be of assistance in cases where there is an alleged miscarriage of justice by providing crucial information to assist in the determination of whether an individual has been wrongly convicted and imprisoned.  The Bill also replaces the legal framework for the collection of forensic evidence from suspects and puts it on a statute-only footing.  In essence, this measure will provide crucial assistance to the Garda in vital areas for decades to come.<\/p><p>  The establishment of a DNA database is long overdue.  While in Opposition, I campaigned for the introduction of such a database.  Its establishment is a commitment in the programme for Government.  On becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence in 2011, I prioritised the introduction of comprehensive legislation to facilitate the optimal use of DNA in the fight against crime and to enhance co-operation with EU Member States and other countries.  In doing so, I was conscious that the legislation should fully respect human rights.  I believe that the legislation before us meets these objectives and strikes the right balance between them.  I want to put on the record of this House my thanks to the officials in my Department and those in the Attorney General's office engaged in the substantial work required to bring this comprehensive measure before the House.<\/p><p>  Significant benefits will arise from the enactment of this legislation and the establishment of a DNA database.  As Deputies will no doubt be aware, the usefulness of a DNA database comes from its capacity to link crime scenes and to identify suspects for unsolved crimes.  This type of intelligence will be invaluable to the Garda in relation to identifying prolific offenders involved in volume crime such as burglary but also in relation to serious offences against the person, such as homicide and sexual offences.  It will also contribute in the move towards more effective, targeted and smarter policing and will facilitate co-operation with other police forces in relation to criminals who travel from one country to another to engage in criminal acts.<\/p><p>  During preparation of the Bill, I was anxious to ensure that everything necessary was done so that, without undue delay following its enactment, the Garda would be able to avail of the assistance provided under the Bill in the crucial work in which they are engaged on a daily basis.  Despite the financial limitations by which we have been constrained since taking up office, the Forensic Science Laboratory was furnished with resources for the necessary specialist staff and to allow for the purchase, installation and validation of sophisticated robotic sample handling instruments to cater for high throughput of samples.  These are now in use and will be capable of processing the anticipated increased submissions associated with a national database.  The Forensic Science Laboratory has also been resourced to purchase an information management system to track all cases and samples from log-in at the laboratory, through all examinations to disposal and despatch on completion and the installation of this system is in progress.<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to thank Dr. Sheila Willis and all of those who work with her for their skill and expertise and the extraordinary assistance they give on a daily basis to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the work undertaken by them in preparation for the enactment of this measure.  Unfortunately, the Bill published by my predecessor in 2010 had many flaws and inadequacies.  While the Bill before the House incorporates much of the 2010 Bill, it contains substantial amendments aimed at addressing issues of genuine concern, particularly in relation to the retention of the samples and DNA profiles of persons who are not subsequently convicted.  The Bill also contains more comprehensive provision in the area of international co-operation, to which I referred earlier.  It is also worth saying that the passage of this Bill will facilitate the State in meeting its obligations under EU law and any international agreements which require the State to maintain DNA and fingerprint databases for criminal investigation purposes and facilitate the searching, on a reciprocal basis and under strict conditions, of other States databases.  I draw the attention of Deputies to Schedules 2 and 3 where the texts of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision and the agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway applying aspects of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision are set out for ease of reference.<\/p><p>  The Bill comprises 157 sections, 12 Parts and three Schedules.  Given its size, I propose to focus on the key elements in the legal framework for the taking, use and destruction of samples.  There will, of course, be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss any other aspects of the Bill that Deputies wish to explore.<\/p><p>  Part 1 deals with preliminary and general issues.  I draw particular attention to sections 2 and 3 which provide definitions and interpretations that are central to understanding the overall framework of the Bill.  Section 7 covers the necessary transitional arrangements between the existing regime and this legislation in order to protect, for example, proceedings underway based on bodily samples taken under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 or under common law powers.  <\/p><p>  Parts 2 to 7 contain important provisions as they set out the powers to take samples of various sorts from different categories of persons.  Before outlining these powers it may be useful to make a few general points about sampling.  First, it is the purpose for which a sample is required that determines the type of sample that may be taken.  For example, where a sample is required from a person solely for the purposes of the database this will be either a mouth swab or plucked head hairs.  These are the least intrusive types of samples and do not require medical input.   Second, where samples are required from a suspect for the purposes of a particular investigation, the type of sample will be determined by the nature of the offence concerned, the circumstances of its commission and the evidence lifted from the crime scene.  For example, swabs from the skin of the suspect may be required to determine whether the suspect had contact with a particular substance or a victim.  The Bill recognises this by permitting a broad range of what are termed intimate and non-intimate samples to be taken for forensic testing in connection with a particular investigation.  The term &quot;forensic testing&quot; is broadly defined and includes the generation of DNA profiles but is not limited to it.<\/p><p>  Part 2 is concerned with the taking of samples from persons in Garda custody.  It is important to note, however, that not all suspects in Garda custody will be subject to the Garda powers to take samples under sections 11, 12 and 13.  As is the case under the 1990 Act, the powers only apply to those in Garda custody under one of the existing detention powers listed in section 9.  Subject to a limited exception, the effect is that only those suspects detained in connection with serious offences, by which I mean offences attracting a maximum prison sentence of five years or more, may be required to provide a sample.  <\/p><p>  Section 11 provides for the taking of samples from persons in custody for the purposes of the database, namely, the investigation of criminal offences generally.  There is no requirement that they assist in the particular investigation at hand.  Samples taken under this section will be instrumental in populating the database and ensuring its effectiveness as a source of intelligence.  Bearing in mind the non-intrusive nature of the sample the consent of the suspect is not required.  I would point out that the taking of samples under section 11 for the purpose of the database must be justified not only by the gravity of the offence for which the person has been detained but also by the nature of the offence.<\/p><p> I also highlight for Deputies certain other limitations placed on the Garda powers created by section 11.  These arise from the need to treat children and other protected persons with great care.  In relation to child suspects, it is already the law that they may be detained where this is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence.  Generally, the detention powers may not be exercised in respect of children under 12 years.  While the Bill does not make changes in this regard, it excludes child suspects under 14 years from the scope of section 11.  This age threshold has been chosen as excluding all child suspects would, having regard to Garda experience, result in a very real loss of intelligence. Section 11(6) commits the Minister to review the operation of this overall section in respect of children after a period of not more than six years.<\/p><p> Protected persons are also excluded from the scope of section 11.  For the purposes of the Bill, such vulnerable persons are defined as children or adults who, by reason of a mental or physical disability, lack the capacity to understand the general nature and effect of the taking of a sample or lack the capacity to communicate by any means, irrespective of whether they consent to the taking of a sample.<\/p><p> Sections 12 and 13 provide for the taking of intimate and non-intimate samples, respectively, for use in evidence.  Intimate samples include blood, urine, swabs from the genital regions and dental impressions.  Due to their nature, such samples require the consent of the suspect and may only be taken by medical professionals.  Section 12(7) and (8) clarify that consent may be withdrawn before or during the taking of the sample, either expressly or by implication, but cannot be withdrawn once the sample has been taken.  In the event that a suspect refuses to give consent or withdraws consent, adverse inferences may be drawn from this in certain circumstances in subsequent proceedings.<\/p><p> Samples taken for evidential purposes under sections 12 and 13 must be authorised by a garda not below the rank of inspector who has reasonable grounds for suspecting the involvement of the person in the commission of a serious offence and for believing that the sample will tend to confirm or disprove such involvement.<\/p><p> The need for an intimate or non-intimate sample in connection with a particular offence may arise from a database hit or independently of any intelligence generated by the database.  A further sample must be taken for use in evidence when a hit links a previously unknown suspect to an unsolved crime.  This is necessary because to use the hit as evidence could be prejudicial to the accused as it could suggest to the jury that the accused had a previous criminal record or at least previous contact with the Garda.  The added benefit of re-doing the forensic tests is that it acts as a quality control mechanism.<\/p><p> Section 24 provides for the use of reasonable force where a suspect refuses to allow a sample to be taken.  I stress, however, that this section only applies to the taking of non-intimate samples and its application is subject to certain safeguards.  Authorisation for this action must be given by a Garda member not below the rank of superintendent and must be carried out in the presence of at least a Garda inspector.  The section does not apply to the taking of a sample from a child under section 11 for the purposes of the database but is available for the taking of non-intimate samples from child suspects and protected persons where they are required for evidential purposes.  The Bill applies additional safeguards for the use of reasonable force in relation to such persons.  The taking of samples under reasonable force must, in all cases, be video recorded.<\/p><p> While the vast majority of samples taken for the purposes of criminal investigations will be taken from suspects or convicted persons, provision is made in Part 3 for the taking of samples by consent from volunteers - people who are not suspects or convicted persons, including victims of an offence or incident - for the purposes of a particular investigation.<\/p><p> Part 3 also provides for mass screenings.  This involves inviting a group of individuals, determined by reference to particular characteristics such as age, gender or a geographical area in which they reside or work, to provide samples for an investigation of a particular offence.  While the decision to carry out such a screening is essentially an operational one, due to its cost and intrusive nature, authorisation by a chief superintendent is required.  Under no circumstances will the DNA profile of a participant be entered in the DNA database.  However, in the event that the screening identifies a potential suspect, he or she may be arrested and detained in connection with the investigation, in which case the sampling powers contained in Part 2 will apply.<\/p><p> To avoid the perception that a refusal to volunteer a sample may be used to ground the arrest and detention of the person in connection with the offence concerned, the Bill specifically provides that a refusal to consent to the taking of a sample shall not of itself constitute reasonable cause for a member of the Garda to suspect the person of having committed the offence concerned for the purpose of arresting and detaining him or her in connection with the investigation of that offence.<\/p><p> Part 4 is an important part of the Bill in terms of populating the database and ensuring it has the capacity to generate intelligence.  It provides for the taking of samples for the database from offenders and former offenders.  In the case of offenders, the following are required to provide samples: all offenders subject to a sentence of imprisonment for a serious offence at commencement, whether they are in prison or living in the community on licence, temporary release or subject to a suspended sentence; those sentenced to imprisonment after commencement in respect of a serious offence; those transferred to prisons in the State following conviction abroad in respect of a serious offence; and those who, on or after commencement, are subject to the sex offender registration requirements.<\/p><p> Where the offender is in prison the sample will be taken by a prison officer.  Should an offender not co-operate, reasonable force can be used where necessary following authorisation at governor level.  Where the offender is in the community he or she will be required to attend at a Garda station to have the sample taken.  Failure to attend will constitute a summary offence.  Similar arrangements apply in the case of child offenders, albeit with additional restrictions in relation to the use of force to take a sample from a child in a children detention school.<\/p><p> This Part also provides for the taking of samples from former offenders, in other words, those who have served sentences for serious offences or who have been subject to the sex offender registration requirements and continue to be of interest to the Garda.  The Bill provides comprehensive guidance to the Garda to assist it in identifying which former offenders should be requested to provide a sample for the database.  In some cases an application to a District Court judge will be required.  The power extends to former offenders who are ordinarily resident or have their principal residence here, regardless of where they were convicted.  It is important to be aware of the risks posed by mobile former offenders.  Giving the Garda the power to require such persons to provide samples for the database goes some way towards mitigating those risks.<\/p><p> The provisions in Part 5 arise from the expansion of the use of DNA technology.  It is necessary to provide for the possibility of accidental contamination of a sample by a person who, in an official capacity, attends at a crime scene or handles a crime scene sample at any stage.  If such accidental contamination is not identified, it may lead to the Garda wasting time and effort investigating unidentified crime scene profiles which relate to a garda who investigated the scene or a member the staff of the Forensic Science Laboratory who examined items taken from the scene or a scientist or pathologist dealing with the case.  The Bill, therefore, sensibly provides for the taking of samples from such persons.  The profiles created will then be available to be searched against unidentified profiles from particular crime scene stains for the purposes of elimination from any further consideration in the context of the investigation.<\/p><p> The Forensic Science Laboratory is being renamed Forensic Science Ireland or FSI under section 157 to better reflect the range of functions conducted by it.<\/p><p> Part 6 is somewhat different from the previous Parts, which were focused on the taking of samples for the purposes of crime investigation.  This Part is concerned with use of the database to assist in finding and identifying missing or unknown persons, alive or deceased.  Samples may be taken, for identification purposes, from blood relatives of persons who are missing, from the belongings of the missing person, from living persons who are unable to identify themselves due to injury or illness, and from the remains of unidentified persons.  A garda of at least the rank of inspector must authorise the taking of a sample from any living person in connection with the identification of persons.  Where it is proposed to take a sample from blood relatives, their consent is obviously required.  In the case of persons unable to identify themselves, an order from the High Court is necessary.  The coroner's consent is required before a sample may be taken from the remains of an unidentified person.<\/p><p> This facility to identify missing or unknown living or deceased persons is undoubtedly of great potential benefit in a number of situations.<\/p><p>It will be invaluable both in the event of a natural or other disaster resulting in mass casualties and in individual cases.<\/p><p> Part 7 deals with the taking of certain samples under Parts 3 and 6 from children or protected persons.  It contains detailed provisions on the issue of consent in this regard and on the provision of information to children and protected persons prior to the taking of samples from them.<\/p><p> Before moving away from the subject of the taking of samples, I should make reference to certain overarching provisions and principles in this regard that are set down under Part 12 of the Bill.  Section 141 is concerned with the human rights and dignity of all persons from whom samples are being taken.  It stipulates that samples are to be taken in circumstances affording reasonable privacy and only in the presence and view of such persons as are necessary to take the sample; in the case of suspects, no samples are to be taken during questioning; and nothing in the Bill authorises the taking of a sample in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner.  Section 142 permits the making of regulations on the taking of samples, but the principles set down in section 141 are of such a fundamental nature that primary legislation is appropriate.<\/p><p> Also in Part 12 on the taking of samples, section 143 requires those bodies empowered to take samples, namely the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Irish Prison Service, the Irish Youth Justice Service and Forensic Science Ireland, to prepare draft codes of practice for ministerial approval.  These codes will provide practical guidance as to the procedures for the taking of samples and are intended to ensure proper adherence to the statutory framework and consistency in approach.<\/p><p> Part 8 of the Bill deals with the structure and purposes of the DNA database.  Responsibility for the database will rest with the FSI, which in its current guise already has a distinguished record in providing independent expertise in the area of forensics and is well placed to become custodian of the database.  Section 60 stipulates that the database may be used for two purposes only: the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences and the finding or identification of missing persons and the identification of unknown persons.<\/p><p> Reflecting these purposes, the database is divided into an investigation division and an identification division.  The investigation division will comprise five indexes of DNA profiles: the crime scene index, the reference index and three elimination indexes, the latter which will contain the profiles of Garda, FSI and other personnel whose duties put them at risk of inadvertently contaminating crime scenes.  The overall purpose of the investigation division is to provide intelligence to be used by garda&iacute; in the investigation of crime.  There are three main sources for the samples used to generate profiles for this division: those lifted from crime scenes, those taken from suspects and convicted persons, and those provided by officials.<\/p><p> The identification division of the database will comprise the missing and unknown persons index.  The results of searching between these two categories of this index will be of vital assistance to the Garda in identifying such persons.<\/p><p> Regarding interrogation of the DNA database, searches are limited to those permitted under section 68.  These restrictions ensure transparency in the operation of the database and that DNA profiles are used only for the purpose for which the related sample was taken.  The Bill also provides that the disclosure of information relating to a sample or information in the database other than for permitted purposes is an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and-or 12 months imprisonment, and on indictment by a fine of up to &euro;50,000 and-or five years in prison.<\/p><p> The DNA database will clearly be a powerful tool and will contain sensitive personal information.  I am sure therefore that all Deputies will, like me, be conscious of the need to ensure that the integrity and security of the database is maintained.  Part 9 of the Bill provides for the establishment of an independent DNA database system oversight committee which will oversee the management and operation of the system.  The committee will review the practices and procedures employed by Forensic Science Ireland in the operation of the database and will report at least annually to the Minister and these reports will be laid before the Oireachtas.  Schedule 1 of the Bill sets out in detail the structure and procedures of the oversight committee, which will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the High Court or Circuit Court, and one of whose members will be nominated by the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p> Part 10 of the Bill deals with the circumstances in which samples and profiles may be destroyed or removed from the database.  This is a very important part of the legal framework and marks a significant departure from the approach taken in the 2010 Bill.  The key changes relate to the retention arrangements for samples and the circumstances in which the DNA profiles of persons who are not proceeded against or are acquitted may be retained on the database.<\/p><p> The changes to the proposed retention arrangements for samples and profiles are aimed at ensuring that the approach to retention is constitutional and meets the standards of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Deputies will recall the 2008 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of S and Marper <i>v<\/i>. the United Kingdom.  That case concerned a challenge to the indefinite retention regime in England and Wales that applied to the samples, profiles and fingerprints of persons who were not subsequently proceeded against or convicted.  The court held that the &quot;blanket and indiscriminate&quot; nature of the arrangements failed to strike a fair balance between public and private interests, were a disproportionate interference with the right to privacy and could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.<\/p><p> The approach in the 2010 Bill regarding persons not proceeded against or convicted consisted of a right to apply to the Garda Commissioner for destruction of a sample or removal of a profile from the database, and an obligation on the Commissioner to destroy samples and remove profiles from the system within certain default periods - three years in the case of the samples, and five and ten years, for children and adults, respectively, in the case of removal of the profiles.<\/p><p> On further reflection and bearing in mind how the law in this area has developed in other jurisdictions in recent years, I decided to recast the retention provisions contained in the 2010 Bill.  Part 10 of the Bill now provides for the destruction of samples taken for the purpose of generating a DNA profile for the database as soon as the profile has been generated or within six months of the taking of the sample, whichever is the later.  It also provides for a presumption in favour of removal from the database of the DNA profiles of suspects who are not convicted subject to the Commissioner having the power to authorise retention on the database where he determines that this is necessary.  His decision is appealable to the District Court.  The retention periods allowed will be six years in the case of adults and three years in the case of children.<\/p><p> Part 10 also provides for revised arrangements for the retention of samples taken for evidential purposes, including a presumption in favour of destruction of samples relating to suspects who are not convicted, subject to the Commissioner having the power to authorise retention for 12 months, which will be renewable, where he determines that this is necessary.  This decision is also appealable to the District Court.  A statutory review of these arrangements is required within a period of six years, and subsequently whenever the Minister considers it appropriate.  The Bill provides that the six and three-year retention periods mentioned earlier may be revised, downwards only, by ministerial order following such a review.<\/p><p> Part 11 of the Bill, which deals with international co-operation, has been expanded to address international obligations in a more comprehensive manner and provides for the reciprocal searching of DNA databases and automated fingerprint identification systems maintained by states for criminal investigation purposes.  In particular the provisions of this Part are aimed at giving effect to the DNA and dactyloscopic data - fingerprint - aspects of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision, which I mentioned earlier, and its implementing Council decision; giving effect to the agreement between Iceland, Norway and the EU applying the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision and the implementing Council decision, the text of which is at Schedule 3 to the Bill; and making provision for bilateral and multilateral agreements on the lines of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision between the State and other states - thus far one agreement has been signed with the United States.<\/p><p> Access to the DNA database and the automated fingerprint identification system by other states will be strictly controlled.  Searches will be conducted by officers authorised for that purpose using DNA profiles or dactyloscopic data that do not contain any identifying data - in other words, it will be anonymous.  In the event that a search reveals a match between the data supplied and data contained on the database being searched, the matter must be pursued within our mutual assistance framework in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  Part 11 includes extensive amendments to the provisions of the 2008 Act dealing with the transmission of identification evidence to other states.<\/p><p>These amendments were aimed at ensuring that persons whose samples or DNA profiles are transmitted under that Act benefit from a comparable level of safeguards to those available to persons who are the subject of criminal investigation within the State.<\/p><p> Access to the databases of other states has the potential to be useful in view of the international mobility of criminals.  Part 11 addresses some specific requirements of the Pr&uuml;m decision in respect of the level of data protection that must be applied to the processing of personal data for the purposes of that decision.  Part 12 contains several miscellaneous provisions, some of the more significant of which I referred to earlier in the context of the taking of samples.  A small number of issues are currently being considered in my Department, in respect of which I will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage.  These mainly relate to data protection and the arrangements for the retention of fingerprints and photographs.<\/p><p> In establishing a DNA database system, the Bill represents a significant step in criminal investigation in this jurisdiction.  It is only right that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have access to the most modern forensic technology to assist the force in solving serious crimes and in the detection of perpetrators.  DNA evidence is only one element in crime investigation but it is potentially a vital element.  Let us remember that not only can the database assist in detecting perpetrators and bringing them to justice but, as I mentioned at the start, it can help to exonerate the innocent as well and lead to better more-targeted use of police resources.  The experience in other jurisdictions demonstrates the important contribution DNA databases make to criminal investigations where crime scenes are examined and produce forensic material.  For example, the United Kingdom national DNA database had a hit rate of 61% in 2011-12.  While hits simply place a person at the crime scene and are not necessarily followed by prosecutions, such a high rate points to the level of intelligence that a DNA database can generate.  I caution Deputies, however, not to expect such high rates in the early years of our database since the rate is party dependent on the size of the database and will grow as the database grows.<\/p><p> As I indicated at the outset, I am acutely aware of the need to strike an appropriate balance between the use of the DNA database in the investigation of crime in the public interest and protecting individuals' personal rights.  I am confident the Bill, with its many safeguards, achieves that balance and I am pleased to commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900016#O00600","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381320000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Last week in Athlone we witnessed a grievous and shocking crime that sent a chill down the spine of all parents.  It was a reminder of the type of criminal act that horrifies us all and demands swift and decisive justice.  The State exists to protect its citizens.  On the front line of the struggle against senseless criminality is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Earlier this year, we saw the price that its members pay to hold the line with the tragic and barbaric murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  It is the duty of us as legislators to ensure that they are fully resourced and equipped to confront the scourge of criminality in whatever shape it takes.  We are tasked with establishing the framework under which the force operates to protect ordinary citizens.  The Bill is an important part of creating that strong framework and Fianna F&aacute;il will support the legislation.<\/p><p>  An effective DNA database forms a critical facet of the modern toolkit for police forces in tackling serious crime head-on.  The legislation builds on the earlier Bill laid out by the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, in 2010.  Those proposals drew from the work of the Law Reform Commission and input from various stakeholders, notably the Irish Human Rights Commission, which had specific concerns about the database.  The Minister has correctly borne in mind that Bill and moved to advance this important addition to the investigative powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The effective use of a DNA database also strengthens the justice system from the other side.  The proper use of DNA evidence will help to identify culprits but will assist in confirming the innocence of suspects as well.  DNA evidence will help to exonerate those accused or convicted in the wrong.<\/p><p>  There are several issues which the Minister should seek to address in the legislation.  First and foremost is the issue of resources.  Second, the remit of the Bill and the potential role for the military police.  Third, the human rights safeguards in the Bill, in particular in respect of international information exchange.  Overall, however, Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill as a measure to arm the Garda with a framework to use DNA that will help the fight against serious crime.<\/p><p>  Laws mean little if there are not sufficient resources to back them up.  Fundamentally, laws are barely worth the paper they are written on if we do not have the Garda adequately resourced to back them up.  A rump demoralised force will not uphold the law of the land regardless of what databases are available to it.  The Minister should keep this to the forefront in the upcoming budget for the Garda.  The Minister has stated he has adequately prepared the forensic science laboratory for the creation of the DNA database.  He has indicated that the laboratory has been allocated substantial resources and information technology capability to deal adequately with the new database.  It is vital that the laboratory is provided with ongoing support and assistance as the level and scope of the work develops and expands with the new database.<\/p><p>  The regulatory impact analysis carried out on the 2010 Bill estimated that the capital costs would be &euro;3 million to establish the DNA database system plus &euro;1.5 million in consumables in the first year, with similar costs annually and with staffing needs dependent on demand for testing of DNA samples.  The Minister must match this level of funding commitment and associated training costs if the laboratory is to be effective.  I trust the Minister's belated conversion to the 13,000 number warning by Garda Commissioner Callinan indicates a new commitment to providing real resources.  The regulatory impact assessment estimated a 29-staff increase would be necessary to deal with the expanded workload of the laboratory.  Has the Minister achieved this?  Are the extra staff in place?  Has a panel been formed for future hiring as demand may require?  It is vital that qualified personnel are in place to oversee the implementation and future development of the database.<\/p><p>  We will be trusting these personnel with highly sensitive information and therefore we must have adequate safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the database.  In addition to the national demands laid on the laboratory, the impact of international co-operation places a further administrative burden to be dealt with.  The new avenues of international engagement will also pose a logistical challenge to the laboratory and Garda resources which must be fully provided for.  It is important that protocols are adhered to during data transfer to ensure information is not exposed in transit.  We have no wish to allow for the prospect of DNA information being found on stolen laptops as occurred with sensitive social welfare information previously in 2008.  The DNA database oversight committee must have the capacity to continually review the system to identify weaknesses and put forward suggestions on resource deficiencies.  The role of the oversight committee will be central in continually updating and improving the system.<\/p><p>  As it stands the Bill does not encompass investigations by the military police.  The Army is currently involved in nine overseas missions throughout the globe in volatile regions.  Only last month our troops deployed on the cusp of the raging Syrian civil war in the increasingly unstable Middle East.  Some 560 Irish troops are currently serving in various conflict-ridden parts of the globe.  The jurisdiction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not apply in these fields of operation or in Army bases abroad.  The Minister should consider amending the Bill to cover the remit of the military police in areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have jurisdiction.  While serious crime is, thankfully, rare and unlikely in our foreign bases we cannot exclude the possibility of it.  The military police should have access to the same toolkit of modern policing methods that the Garda can use to tackle crime.  I trust the Minister will consider the proposal under this legislation or future measures.<\/p><p>  The creation of a database touches upon several delicate human rights issues.  In the seminal Ryan <i>v<\/i>. Attorney General judgment in 1965 the Supreme Court found that the right to bodily integrity was among the unenumerated rights in the Constitution.  The right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right and another unenumerated personal right in our Constitution.<\/p><p>The Bill, therefore, must tread carefully to respect and uphold the highest standards of human rights which we have set ourselves.   Members must also be cognisant of their responsibilities to the standards set by EU directives in this matter.  In broad terms, the Minister has struck a fair balance between the demands of constitutional necessity and of the need to confront criminality.  The time limits on keeping information and restrictions on extracting information from volunteers are adequate safeguards.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has raised specific concerns with regard to the international exchange of DNA information.  It is imperative that public trust in the new system and the human rights standards Ireland has set for itself be maintained and to achieve that level of trust, one must ensure that other states with which Ireland exchanges information are held up to the same standards we set for ourselves.  Consequently, one cannot allow such highly sensitive information to be exposed to reduced standards that undermine the efforts taken in Ireland to protect the data involved.<\/p><p> The oversight committee should be entrusted with reviewing international protocols and standards with regard to the states with which Ireland exchanges information.  The same standard of safeguards and reassurance should be instilled across all Ireland's interactions with other states.  The committee's international remit will aim to secure the best global standards in data protection and effective use of the DNA database.  Any loss of confidence in the system will undermine its use as an investigative tool, thereby robbing the Garda of an invaluable aid in the struggle against serious criminality.  Ultimately, the oversight committee may be obliged to make strong recommendations against the transfer of information to states with dubious levels of protections.  While this may be controversial in some circumstances, it will act as a barrier against the misuse of the system.  In another context, all Members recently saw the controversy in the United States involving the PRISM system used by its National Security Agency.  Employees grossly misused a sophisticated spying system for their own personal ends and it is a reminder of the need to set up strong safeguards of any security apparatus, as the innocent may be victims of grave misuse.  The oversight committee carries the weight of this expectation.<\/p><p> In conclusion, this Bill is an important step in the battle against serious crime.  It is necessary to create a framework for the Garda that empowers it to take the fight to criminals with cutting-edge technology.  A DNA database puts Ireland in step with its international counterparts and allows for the exchange of information across borders.  The global nature of serious crime and ease of transportation renders this ever more important.  The victims of serious crime deserve justice.  It is the fundamental and most basic duty of the State to protect its citizens and this Bill forms part of that duty.<\/p><p> I trust that the Minister will reflect upon some of the concerns I have raised with the scope of the Bill.  In the context of acute budgetary constraints, it is important that the database is not starved of funds to the point that it is rendered useless.  The military police also should be covered by the remit of the legislation in order that our fighting men and women abroad are protected.  Whenever a new database is established, one must bear in mind the fragility of human rights balanced against a powerful state.  I believe this Bill strikes a good balance.<\/p><p> I note the same fly that was following the Minister while he was speaking is now following me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900019#R00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381320600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>It is a Sinn F&eacute;in fly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900020#S00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1381320600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I predict it will attack Deputy Mac Lochlainn in a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900020#S00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1381320600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>It will be following Deputy Mac Lochlainn in a minute.<\/p><p>  The oversight committee must be used to copper-fasten the role of international exchange standards.

The use of forensic science to solve criminal cases is growing globally.  A multidisciplinary field that embraces chemistry, physics, botany, zoology and medicine, forensic science includes the identification of human bodies or traces.  Traditional methods such as fingerprinting and trace analyses are still used with the assistance of computers.  In addition, forensic dentistry, voice and speech spectrograms, blood analysis and DNA analysis are increasingly applied.  A wide range of powers and procedures are now available to enable the Garda and indeed the PSNI to take, compare and retain crime scene evidence, including photographs, fingerprints, footwear impressions and objects including suspected weapons or parts thereof, as well as the taking of intimate samples for evidentiary comparison.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges the need for collection and analysis of forensic evidence.  However my party is also aware that forensic science is constantly evolving and the degree of its accuracy is a continual matter of debate among experts.  For example, in 2009 a debate emerged among forensic scientists on whether a certain type of internal bleeding seen in infant deaths can only be caused by the shaking of a baby, which finding generally results in a murder conviction.  Closer to home, in 2007 Sean Hoey was acquitted in the Omagh bombing case as a consequence of the judge&rsquo;s rejection of the validity of the low copy number, LCN, DNA profiling technique that has been used in more than 21,000 serious crime cases in the British jurisdiction and internationally, particularly in cold cases.  These are two of many situations in which the use of forensic science is at the very least uncertain and potentially could lead to perversion of justice.  Sinn F&eacute;in therefore believes that ongoing research is needed in a variety of areas where forensic methods and definitions, both newly emergent and established, are being used in court for the prosecution of persons.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, most methods of forensic evidence gathering are accepted by Sinn F&eacute;in as being generally relevant and necessary methods of criminal investigation where applied to the appropriate standard by trained personnel and under appropriate supervision and monitoring.  While I welcome the main thrust of this Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in has several concerns it would like to raise and on which it may seek to include amendments.  At the core of this debate, one must remember that any prejudice to the presumption of innocence must be eliminated.  One cannot move to a position in which people without criminal records are being treated as potential suspects for future crimes.  One of my main objections to this Bill relates to its providing for the taking of samples such as mouth swabs or hair follicles from some former offenders who no longer are subject to sentence.  This is stated in section 33 of the Bill, where it states that a sample may be taken from a former offender.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to clarify at a later stage whether that means this Bill will not have due regard for the Good Friday and Weston Park agreements.  Is it compliant with these agreements because, initially, this seems contrary to the workings thereof?  A concern would arise in respect of the retention of anything related to former political prisoners released under the Good Friday Agreement.  The ICCL has highlighted another concern in the form of international co-operation, specifically concerning how samples or DNA profiles generated from such samples or both may be transmitted to other states, including outside the European Union.  Again, I call on the Minister for clarification.  Will the role of the proposed DNA database system oversight committee extend to reviewing the appropriateness of the date protection safeguards in place in states to which samples or profiles may be transmitted?  I agree wholeheartedly with the ICCL that as a matter of principle, profiles or samples should never be transmitted to states that cannot guarantee they will protected by appropriate privacy safeguards.  I also ask the Minister the reason this Bill was never submitted to the Irish Human Rights Commission for its consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900020#S00700","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1381320600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900020#S00800","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1381320600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I am very close to concluding.

There is no point in passing this legislation only to be faced with poor resources.  Function creep is another issue of concern with this Bill and Sinn F&eacute;in does not want to see a situation in which there is a gradual widening of the database beyond the purposes for which it was originally intended.  I wish to conclude by warning that although there are many positives to a DNA database, one must keep in mind that they can put innocent people at risk.  This is particularly the case as technology has developed to allow the generation of DNA profiles from the tiniest of DNA samples.  In the Omagh bomb case LCN DNA evidence produced a partial match to a six-year old schoolboy in Nottingham who was on the British database.

In addition, the agreement will give certainty to public servants over the next three year period.<\/p><p>  As Members of the House are acutely aware, we entered into discussions with trade unions with an ambitious target of agreeing on a number of measures aimed at reducing the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by the end of 2015 and by &euro;300 million this year.  That was the basis on which we engaged with staff representatives and it was the imperative on which any agreement had to be delivered.

The &euro;300 million savings target for 2013, arising from measures under the agreement, was incorporated into the various Votes in the context of the Revised Estimates, which I published last April as the Deputy will recall.  In this context, Deputies will be aware that the Exchequer returns at the end of September show that expenditure is being effectively managed within those voted allocations.  The Haddington Road agreement is playing a key part in ensuring expenditure continues to be contained within those relevant ceilings.<\/p><p>  I find the outcome of the ASTI ballot on the agreement regrettable.  The Government is fully supportive of the Minister for Education and Skills in seeking to minimise the disruption the industrial action taken by teachers will cause in classrooms, while seeking to ensure the integrity of the public service agreement, and the achievement of the necessary savings from the education sector pay bill.

Furthermore, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure all available resources are spent carefully and that critical public services continue to be delivered.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Government recognises that expenditure on social supports has an important impact on stabilising our domestic economy through supporting the overall demand for goods and services.  Over recent years, we have maintained primary weekly rates of social welfare.  This year we will spend &euro;20.2 billion on social welfare.  This means that all pensioners and all those under the age of 66, such as people with disabilities or jobseekers, will have their weekly primary payments maintained, and that has been the case since this Government took office.<\/p><p>  Similarly, in the area of education, the Government has protected DEIS resources.

One can take a snapshot of individual budgets rather than considering the overall picture.  Ireland has the most progressive income tax system in the OECD.

As he is aware, job creation is a critical priority for Government.  In July 2012 the Government announced its plans for an additional &euro;2.25 billion investment in public infrastructure projects in Ireland.  The most important contribution capital investment can make is to provide the capacity for the economy to grow, which, in turn, will create jobs.  The largest portion of the stimulus package included &euro;1.4 billion to fund the proposed new public private partnership, PPP, programme and the delivery of this was the initial focus for my Department.  This &euro;1.4 billion investment is additional to the direct investment by the Exchequer in infrastructure, which will be some &euro;3.4 billion this year.  That is a great deal of money.<\/p><p>  In July I announced details of the first tranche of the Exchequer phase of projects worth &euro;150 million.  This investment will be in schools, roads and local authority energy efficiency projects.  Under the latter, retrofitting will take place in respect of some 25,000 local authority houses.  Progress is being made on the roll-out of the roads projects by the relevant local authorities and I am informed that the money allocated will be completely expended this year.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport expects to spend its full allocation of &euro;50 million by the end of the year.  The Department of Education and Skills expects to spend approximately &euro;10 million of its additional allocation on various projects by the end of the year.  The balance will be rolled over into next year.<\/p><p>  Activity on the PPP programme is well under way, with five of the nine projects already issued to market.  The flagship Grangegorman project, which is valued at over &euro;200 million, is due to issue in the coming weeks.  I am pleased to report that there has been very active market engagement from both investors and construction companies in this area.  That reflects the growing confidence in the Irish economy.  Investment in the projects included in the stimulus package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs throughout the country.  Analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in PPP projects will generate in the region of 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>  At this early stage in the process, most of the employment impact has been in the technical and advisory areas.  The indicative timetable for the projects suggests construction is expected to commence on the first roads project by the end of 2013 and on the accommodation projects by quarter four of 2014.<\/p><p>  As part of the ongoing monitoring of employment in respect of current PPPs, the most recent figures from the schools bundle 3 project indicate 4,079 man months of full-time equivalent employment have been engaged up to the end of August.  We will also be monitoring the level of employment being created during the construction of the N11 and Newlands Cross PPP which commenced in June.<\/p><p>  My Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the sponsoring authorities has examined how to maximise job creation as part of each tender competition.  As a result of this, a pilot is under way for the schools building programme.  In that context, tender competitions will now include a clause which sets out particular employment requirements such as 10% of the aggregate number of person weeks carried out on the site to be undertaken by those who are recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  In addition, 2.5% of the aggregate number of person weeks carried out on the site will be undertaken by apprentices.  Feedback received by my Department from the NDFA is that the Intreo office in the Department of Social Protection is very keen to become involved in this initiative and is actively setting up the relevant contacts with contractors at local level.  Enterprise Ireland is also involved in running workshops and &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events aimed at the SME sector.  The NDFA's initial impression is that the initiative is working well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900022#V01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1381321800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Approximately one year ago the Minister informed me that he was in favour of ensuring that the leaks in the water supply system would be repaired before the process of installing water meters commenced.

As I indicated, the end of September Exchequer returns are on target.<\/p><p>  While net capital expenditure was 17% below profile at the end of September, information supplied to me by Departments indicates that the majority of their remaining capital budgets will be spent by year end.

Where this is not possible, the allocation, to a maximum of 10%, will be rolled over into the next year.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large payment tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  The profiling of capital expenditure is carried out by individual Departments on the basis of the likely timing of payments related to capital projects and programmes which they deliver.<\/p><p>  In June of this year, I announced additional Exchequer investment of &euro;150 million.  The focus of this investment will be on relatively small-scale capital works that are labour intensive.

That number should have decreased to 282,500 by 2015, in line with the target set by the Government.  This means that between now and 2015, the number employed in the public service will fall in net terms by a further 2.7%.  I anticipate that this will mostly be achieved through natural retirement across the service, while allowing for recruitment in areas where that is authorised.  The 282,500 target will mark a 12% reduction in the size of the public service since the peak value of 320,000 in 2008.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on reducing the size of the public service is one of its key broader reform agenda items.  It needs to be understood in the context of two main drivers.  First, there is undeniably a need to repair the public finances.  Second, we need to improve and catch up with international best practice in how public services are delivered.  This is why through reform initiatives we are building on existing good practices and addressing areas where there are too many agencies, too much duplication, not enough automation, not enough use of e-technologies, not enough shared services, poor practices and sub-optimal structures.  This transition is difficult.  It is difficult to shed staff while maintaining service levels and rolling out new services, but it is necessary.<\/p><p>  To help us safeguard our core public services, we will deliver an unprecedented increase in productivity across the public service through the Haddington Road agreement, which is currently under way.  We will provide for almost 15 million additional working hours and a range of other reforms and efficiencies agreed by the public sector unions.  One of the main benefits of these additional hours is that they will allow public service management to maintain services with fewer staff.  We have already achieved real and tangible progress in areas such as cost reduction, improving efficiency and enhancing service delivery.  The roll-out of reform against a backdrop of reduced numbers has produced challenges.  I compliment all those in the public service who have risen to the challenge.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>In so far as possible, front-line services have been protected.  In parallel, there has been real and permanent reform of service delivery models to the benefit of citizens and businesses.  Earlier this year, we launched the Civil Service human resources and pensions shared services centre.  It serves over 15,000 employees across 13 organisations.  When it is fully operational, it will lead to substantial savings estimated at &euro;12.5 million annually, with a reduction of 17% in staff numbers in human resources across the Civil Service.  We have allowed for some targeted recruitment into priority areas, particularly health and education, while continuing to reduce the size of the public service overall.  Redeployment has been an important enabler of this managed reduction of public service numbers.  Since 2010, more than 10,000 surplus staff have been redeployed into priority areas.  With regard to alternative strategies to achieve savings, I remind the Deputy that the cost of running the public service in Ireland accounts for some 36% of total Government expenditure.  It would be impossible to put the public finances back onto a sustainable footing without addressing this sizable element of the cost base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900024#X00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1381323000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Government is adamant that the downsizing of the public service has saved the country a great deal of money, despite its catastrophic impact on public services.

Would the Minister agree that the exodus from the public service has hit the front line hardest and has resulted in a disastrous draining of knowledge, skills, experience and expertise that has been developed over many years?  I will give two examples.

The report of a consultation with civil society representatives and citizens across Ireland on the Open Government Partnership process was submitted to me on 1 October.  The report, which proposes a number of recommendations, is available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  A number of the recommendations contained in the group's report focus on transparency and accountability.  The proposals reflect a strong desire among citizens and civil society in general to be provided with the information they need to understand how decisions are made, how public funds are spent and how individuals and institutions are held to account.  One of the recommendations involves improving the budgetary data, transparency and timelines.  It reflects, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the view that there should be more public discussion and analysis of budgetary proposals.<\/p><p>The recommendations made in the course of the OGP consultation process are consistent with the Government's commitments to bring about a major transformation of Ireland's budgetary system.  As the Deputy will be aware, a number of initiatives are under way which increase budget transparency and accountability.  The key elements of the budgetary reform agenda were outlined in the public service reform plan published in November 2011.  These reforms are the annual stability programme update published in April each year, a modern, multi-annual framework that has been put in place, departmental Estimates being presented in a different and more accessible format, a performance budgeting initiative being implemented, expenditure ceilings, which were on an administrative basis, now being on a statutory footing through the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013, and the Government increasing its ongoing scrutiny and evaluation of public expenditure, with all value for money studies now being published.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p> All of the foregoing reforms allow greater opportunities for Oireachtas Members, as representatives of the public, to play a more substantive role throughout the entire budgetary process, from initial allocation of funds through to holding Ministers and public service managers to account for the achievement, or non-achievement, of stated performance targets.  Moreover, the Government is moving towards a whole-of-year budgetary timetable that allows for greater and more meaningful engagement by Oireachtas committees in contributing to Estimates discussions in advance of the allocations being finalised.  In this regard, my Department has supported the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in piloting this new approach to briefing select committees.  This framework of budgetary reform will facilitate further consideration of the proposals on budgetary transparency contained in the report of the consultation undertaken by civil society.<\/p><p> As part of the next phase of the Open Government Partnership process, I intend to bring a memorandum to Government shortly outlining the civil society group's report and submissions received.  I expect, subject to Government approval, to establish a group comprising both public officials and civil society representatives who will give further consideration to all recommendations made, including on budgetary matters, and to prioritise in terms of what is realistic and achievable over the next two years for inclusion in the first action plan.  Action plans cover a two year period and we will report on progress annually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900024#X01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381323600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I think we would all agree that aspirations have still to become a reality.

Furthermore, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure all available resources are spent carefully and that critical public services continue to be delivered.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Government recognises that expenditure on social supports has an important impact on stabilising our domestic economy through supporting the overall demand for goods and services.  Over recent years, we have maintained primary weekly rates of social welfare payments.  This year we will spend &euro;20.2 billion on social welfare.  This means that all pensioners and all those under 66 years of age, such as people with disabilities or jobseekers, will have their weekly primary payments fully maintained, and that has been the case since this Government took office.<\/p><p>  Similarly, in the area of education, the Government has protected DEIS resources.  In budget 2013, for example, we ensured there was no overall change to DEIS related staffing levels or DEIS funding.  As part of the DEIS programme, over the course of this year some &euro;93 million is being provided to 850 schools supporting 167,000 pupils.  This funding is provided, in addition to the normal funding allocation, to address educational disadvantage by prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from preschool right through second level education.<\/p><p>All Ministers are responsible for assessing policy proposals in their areas, and considerations of equality form an important component of budgetary discussions by Government.  When making Government decisions on budget matters, the Government is very much aware of issues such as gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and people with disabilities.  These proposals are under careful consideration by Government in advance of finalising the 2014 Estimates and, on budget day, the Government will publish illustrative cases showing the effect of major changes in revenue and certain social welfare payments.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, I introduced the new whole-of-year budgeting reform, which was announced in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014.  This new process has been designed to enhance the role and the policy relevance of the Oireachtas in particular with regard to the role of committees in <i>ex ante<\/i>  consideration of resource allocation priorities in each area.  That is the point I made to Deputy Wallace.  In future, I intend that this will provide a forum in which Oireachtas committees and Departments can assess and discuss the equality implications of any policy proposal in advance of the final Estimates being decided upon.<\/p><p>  With regard to the progressive nature of the budget, I point out to the Deputies that the ESRI recently published analysis on the distributional impacts of budgets 2009 to 2013.  Its analysis shows that the overall adjustment to date has been progressive in nature, with the lowest losses occurring in the lower income deciles and the highest losses in the top income deciles.  In addition to this, it is important to point out that Ireland's tax and benefits system has been shown by the OECD to be highly redistributive, with the tax system shown to be the most progressive of developed economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900025#Y02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1381324200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I was surprised that we were grouping some of the questions.

If one has maximised the income take so that the marginal rate is now one of the highest, can one keep going?  One can be more progressive each time but in relative terms, if one already has the most progressive income tax system, one cannot keep pushing it up to suit an additional snapshot.  The Deputy is making a very fair point.  We need a better and more accurate snapshot because many things that are looked at under the current switch system do not take account of capital gains adjustments and other factors which impact on the totality of the budget.  One needs to look at the entire tax package, not the minor adjustment that is made at budget time, to see whether it is progressive as it sits with other taxation regimes.

First, I agree with her entirely that we need an objective analysis and not a partisan analysis from either side of the House.

Can one tweak it one way or the other, do a snapshot of that and pretend that is an accurate snapshot of the totality?  No, one cannot, which is why I am saying we need better tools to do that.  I know that Deputy McDonald will use whatever data she can to her own political advantage but that is not good in terms of society.<\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned lone parents.

This represents a significant portion of overall spending and, therefore, it is essential that the public service achieve maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  In this regard, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by my Department last year.  The report of the review, which was published on the Department's website last year, found that significant savings could be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.  In order to realise these benefits, the National Procurement Service has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service's buying power in respect of a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service.  These national arrangements have benefits that include cash savings, administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering, greater purchasing expertise, improved consistency and enhanced service levels.<\/p><p>  Earlier this year, I announced the appointment of a chief procurement officer to lead a key element of the Government's public service reform agenda.  The new approach to public procurement will involve integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office, namely, the Office of Government Procurement; strengthening spend analytics and management; a much greater aggregation of purchasing across the public service to achieve better value for money; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900028#BB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1381325400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I table this question because I am generally supportive of the concept of the national procurement office located in the Minister's Department.

I wish to draw his attention to a gross injustice being perpetrated by a wealthy, large, multinational conglomerate against a group of some of the most decent, loyal and hard working people I am privileged to know.  I am referring to the Wallis dispute in Limerick.<\/p><p>  The Wallis shop is one of a number of units owned by the Arcadia Group, a multinational corporation headquartered in London.  There is a long-standing agreement to the effect that, when the company makes someone redundant in Ireland, it makes a redundancy payment of five weeks per year's service - the statutory redundancy that it is legally obliged to pay plus three weeks of its own volition.<\/p><p>  The company has suddenly changed the goal posts.  In respect of the Wallis group of workers, it has decided that it will only pay 2.75 weeks per year's service, which is its statutory obligation plus 0.75.  This is despite the fact that, only a few short months ago when the company was dealing with other redundancies in Dublin, it paid the five weeks even though the staff in question had nothing like the length of service of the staff in Limerick.  These people have served the company loyally for as long as 20 years or more.  They have built the business from the ground up and into the undoubted success that it is today.<\/p><p>The amount of redundancy is not the only issue.  There are also issues about how the company is handling restructuring.  While I do not have time to go into the matter in detail, suffice to say that the treatment being meted out to the employees in this regard can only be described as shoddy, shabby and contemptible.<\/p><p> We should look for a moment at the multinational corporation that is involved in this sort of skulduggery.  The Arcadia group has over 10,000 employees and is privately owned by a gentleman called Sir Philip Green who is well known in financial and society circles throughout the world.  Photographs of him are to be seen as often in the society pages as in the financial pages, besporting himself on his yacht in Monte Carlo with his rich and famous friends.<\/p><p> This company recently announced that it was in the acquisitions business.  The announcement stated that &quot;being debt free, gives us the balance-sheet and the flexibility for further acquisition&quot;.  Incidentally, the company recently transferred &pound;92 million from its Irish operation to its headquarters in the UK.  When asked about that, the company said it was for house-keeping purposes.<\/p><p> This company is literally awash with cash and has benefited enormously from the loyal service of its Irish workforce, including the workers in Limerick.  Is the Minister prepared to intervene in this case?  Those people are walking up and down outside the store in all sorts of weather.

Similar terms are being offered to staff based in the Childers Road branch, which is to undergo restructuring as part of a nationwide Wallis restructuring plan.<\/p><p>  Pickets were placed at the two Wallis stores in Limerick on 23 September.  I understand that Wallis, which is part of the Arcadia group, had agreed severance terms with the trade union Mandate of five weeks pay per year of service in respect of workers made redundant in 2012 in Wallis stores in Dublin, Wexford and Cork.  However, I understand that for the Limerick staff, 2.75 weeks pay per year of service has been offered.<\/p><p>  It is also my understanding that talks aimed at resolving this dispute had taken place - a development which I welcomed.  The company put forward fresh proposals during these talks but I understand that these have been rejected by the Mandate trade union.

I urge the parties involved in this dispute to have regard to the availability of the industrial relations dispute resolution bodies to assist them in seeking a settlement and in addressing the underlying challenges of a major restructuring of the company.  Experience constantly shows us that what often appears to be the most intractable of matters is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.

I particularly welcome the opportunity and space given to residents to examine the framework of solutions proposed.  It is significant that the Minister indicated that the Government would establish an oversight process to ensure that the framework is implemented effectively so that individual issues can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>  We must allow the residents and owners of the Priory Hall apartments all necessary time to consider the proposals on the table and determine whether they are happy with what has been proposed.  At this delicate time, I would not like to comment further on any of the reported key proposals in order to allow the residents and owners the space they need to make a decision on what has been put before them.<\/p><p>  It is astonishing and appallingly sad, however, that the resolution now being considered could not have been brought forward much earlier in the almost two years that owner-occupiers and residents have spent out of their homes.  As the House will remember, today is one of over 100 occasions on which I have raised the matter of Priory Hall since I contacted the Dublin fire chief on the matter in 2009.<\/p><p>  There are some concerns on some of the broader aspects of the reported resolution, however.<\/p><p>For example, will the Minister be able to indicate to D&aacute;il, even at a later stage, what arrangements are being put in place regarding the large number of apartments owned or formerly owned by the developer Tom McFeely given his responsibility for the debacle at Priory Hall?<\/p><p> There are grave concerns about the statement made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to the effect that the Priory Hall complex may be refurbished and managed by Dublin City Council as the agent of the Department.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly and rightly said that Priory Hall was one of the worst examples of the failures of the Celtic tiger era.  However, the failed planning and invigilation of the Priory Hall development was overseen by Dublin City Council under managers John Fitzgerald and John Tierney, both of whom have major questions to answer not only in regard to Priory Hall but on the wider serious problems of the North Fringe.  The flotilla of developers in the North Fringe, led by Gerry Gannon, and including Tom McFeely, also bear a heavy responsibility for problems in the North Fringe.<\/p><p> Dublin City Council and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have a track record of botched regeneration projects across Dublin city which take decades to complete or ultimately end up being demolished.  Many are questioning whether Dublin City Council is the appropriate agency to refurbish Priory Hall and whether the North Fringe deserves a totally fresh start with a new much more competent overseeing body.  It has been the view of constituents for a long time that Priory Hall should be demolished and that the part of Clongriffin Boulevard on which it stands should be totally rebuilt and redeveloped westwards to Belmayne and the proposed Clare Hall town centre.  The Minister of State will be aware that part of Priory Hall is located on the boulevard connecting the proposed new two town centres for the North Fringe.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, indicated that demolition and reconstruction of the complex was being strongly considered.  <\/p><p> Even a cursory cost benefit estimate based on information given in briefings to public representatives in 2011 and 2012 seemed to clearly indicate that demolition was the best and most cost effective option.  Why has this view now changed and can the Minister of State provide information on the cost benefit analysis, including all external costs, on which this apparent decision is based?  It is hoped that the shocking saga of Priory Hall will now swiftly be resolved to the satisfaction of the owner-occupiers and other stakeholders in the complex.  The Minister and the Department need to address all of the wider issues of the North Fringe to which I have referred, including, for example, including designation of the whole area as a strategic development zone and putting the North Fringe Forum a statutory basis?  The Minister of State may recall my proposals in relation to the North Fringe approximately 12 years ago.  <\/p><p> Priory Hall aside, new residents and their representatives have had to deal with serious issues such as pyrite damage, insulation and fire safety issues and a failure to deliver key health, shopping and other services to the wider North Fringe.  At this important time in the development of this new urban region, the Minister has an opportunity to undertake a fundamental review of the North Fringe area, which as the Minister of State will be aware, is approximately the same size as Waterford city.  Planning and invigilation of this area has thus far left much to be desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900029#CC00800","speaker":"1020","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381326600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter, in which I am aware he has had a strong interest for a long time.

I echo the Minister's acknowledgement of the manner in which all parties concerned have engaged in good faith in this difficult and complex process and the very tight timeframe within which they have produced a framework for resolving a unique and exceptional situation which was not of their making.<\/p><p>  Priory Hall residents have been kept abreast of the discussions and have been briefed on the framework.  Understandably, they have asked for an opportunity to consider the proposals carefully.  Therefore, to respect the wishes of the residents, details of the proposed framework will not be made public at this stage.  I would welcome Deputy Broughan's support in this regard.  In broad terms, the proposed framework recognises the exceptional and unique difficulties faced by the home owners in Priory Hall over the past two years and offers a fair and reasonable solution to their housing needs.  The proposals are now being considered by the residents.  I hope they will be found to meet their needs and thus provide them with an opportunity to get on with their lives.  Discussions with the residents in relation to the proposed resolution framework are ongoing.<\/p><p>  As regards the future of the Priory Hall complex, the intention is that in line with the framework proposal Dublin City Council will undertake to ensure that Priory Hall is refurbished into a desirable, high quality, safe location that will include a mix of social and private residential units in line with current housing policy.  The Government also intends to establish an oversight process, with participation from the residents, to ensure that the framework is implemented effectively and to deal with specific issues that arise on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>  The problems at Priory Hall are many and complex.  Attempts to resolve them are currently at a delicate and critical point and I would remind all concerned who are not directly involved of the need for sensitivity in this regard.  I understand that when the residents' response to the proposed framework is to hand later this week, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will formally update all members on the outcome of the recent process of engagement.  He is also mindful of the commitment given by the Taoiseach during Leader's Questions on 19 September 2013 and will arrange for a formal briefing of local representatives on the resolution framework and for regular briefing on key developments thereafter during the implementation phase of any agreement which may arise.<\/p><p>  Priory Hall was one of the worst examples of the failures of the Celtic tiger years.

Following a long-standing campaign, the local community was very pleased when a bypass was finally built.  In many respects, however, Fermoy did not benefit from the bypass because a toll was imposed almost immediately, resulting in large trucks continuing to pass through the town as haulage companies sought to avoid the toll.  The problem has been compounded in recent years by two major floods which caused significant damage.  Work on the necessary flood relief in Fermoy has meant the town is effectively a building site and continues to be a traffic bottleneck.<\/p><p>  Members of the local community are annoyed the bypass was not included in a scheme under which roads tolls will be lifted on certain roads in November.  On hearing of the proposal, local people were hopeful the town would benefit and the lifting of the toll on the bypass would convince hauliers to use the bypass and encourage people to visit the town for shopping in the run-up to Christmas.  Moreover, the reduction in haulage traffic in the town would have presented an opportunity to complete some of the flood relief works.  <\/p><p>  I am disappointed Government Deputies failed to have the town bypass included in the roads on which tolls will be lifted in November.

In light of the efforts the Government has made in this regard, I am pleased to give credit where it is due.  The lifting of tolls for hauliers in November will help make the year a little easier for haulage companies, many of which are barely scraping a living as a result of the ongoing recession and the rising cost of keeping vehicles on the road.  The lifting of tolls will help local economies by freeing up regional and local roads and giving local people greater access to local businesses.<\/p><p>  In his press statement on the initiative, the Minister expressed concern that large numbers of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, continue to use regional and local roads to avoid tolls and are driving through towns, villages and rural areas.  This practice, he continued, has safety implications for other road users, residents and pedestrians.  In addition, by using local and regional roads instead of custom built motorways, HGVs are adding to the wear and tear of the legacy roads network, the statement noted.  If safety and avoiding wear and tear are the reasons for removing tolls for heavy goods vehicle, one would find it difficult to find a more suitable route than the Fermoy bypass for inclusion in the scheme.  The case for doing so has been well made by Deputy McLellan.<\/p><p>  Members of the local community in Fermoy very much hope the initiative will be extended to include the M8.  The Revive Fermoy group, in particular, believed the inclusion of the town bypass would be a useful exercise.  The chairman of Fermoy Town Council's traffic management sub-committee, independent councillor Michael Hanley, was under the impression the scheme would be a national initiative and expressed disappointment at the exclusion from it of the Fermoy bypass.  Local people also believe its inclusion would help in terms of assessing the value of using the motorway route versus traversing the town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900031#EE00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1381327200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue and I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for his absence.<\/p><p>  The Minister has responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Furthermore, the statutory powers to levy tolls on national roads, make toll by-laws and enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads are vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000, and the Roads Act 2007.  While toll rates vary in line with consumer prices, the base rates are built into the public private partnership financing arrangements which enabled the high quality motorway network to be built.<\/p><p>  Completion of the major inter-urban motorway programme in recent years has greatly enhanced the freight industry's access to a high quality road network between key urban centres.  Given the scale of the investment in our motorways, an issue of concern to the Minister is the number of heavy goods vehicles which divert on to regional and local roads to avoid tolls and drive through towns, villages and rural areas rather than use the custom built motorways.  This practice has significant safety implications for other road users, residents and pedestrians and adds to the wear and tear of the legacy roads network.  For this reason, earlier this year the Minister asked the National Roads Authority to examine the feasibility of lifting tolls for HGVs for one month on one or more motorways.  He made clear at the time that the scope of the trial would be subject to consideration of the costs involved.  He, therefore, asked the NRA to engage with all the toll companies to assess the costs associated with this initiative.  Given the high costs associated with rolling out the scheme throughout the network, it was not possible to include all tolled roads in the scheme.  Best practice for a short-term pilot such as this is to examine the efficacy of the scheme at a limited number of tolling points.  The selection of the pilot tolls was made on the basis of analysis conducted by the NRA.<\/p><p>  The Minister, through the trial involving a toll free month on certain routes, wants to ascertain if HGV fleet operators can be persuaded to make greater use of the motorways.  He considers that this will provide a worthwhile opportunity to study traffic levels in detail and assess the implications.  It will also give fleet operators an opportunity to evaluate the time and efficiency benefits of using the motorways in question.  While all routes cannot be included in the trial, the findings arising from this month long survey will feed into general tolling policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900031#EE00500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1381327200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Local businesses face significant pressures and some are closing with each passing month.  Having been hit hard by severe flooding, Fermoy is struggling because the large number of haulage trucks passing through the town and ongoing substantial flood relief works have resulted in traffic choking up the town.

Reports in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i> paint a very bleak picture of lax health and safety standards, poor hygiene levels and gross overcrowding across several asylum accommodation centres across the country.  Serious questions need to be asked about the operation of these centres.  Nobody can now deny that there is a major issue with the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  Almost 5,000 people, 1,700 of whom are children, are kept in direct provision centres.  They are given accommodation, three meals a day and &euro;19.10 per week while they wait for their application for asylum to be heard by the High Court.  They live in hostel-like accommodation in dispersed centres around the country, with families often housed in one room with faulty heating, and shower and toilet facilities are often shared.  They are neither allowed to work nor to claim State benefits while they are resident in the centres.  They are therefore prohibited from supporting themselves and paying taxes.  They have no say over where they are accommodated and can be moved from one of the 35 centres across 16 counties without consultation and at a moment's notice.<\/p><p>  Concerns about the centres have been raised by various groups, including UN committees and by former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, who said there were real fears for the safety of children living in direct provision centres and warned conditions were not suitable.

The average length of stay of the residents in direct provision centres is 47 months and more than 500 people have been living in direct provision for seven years.  I have a number of concerns I would like the Minister to address on this topic which has had considerable discussion on the public airwaves and elsewhere in recent days.<\/p><p>  Staff, who were already employed in direct provision centres before the change in legislation, do not have to be Garda vetted despite working with vulnerable adults and children.  RIA's child protection policy is too weak and wholly inadequate for a modern democratic State.  Direct provision centres are not included in HIQA's remit as parents are present, but this cannot be viewed as a normal parenting environment given that parents have no control over who is present with their children in communal areas, including communal bathrooms.  During a committee debate on 12 October 2010, several members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children called for HIQA inspections to be carried out in direct provision hostels following a visit by members of the committee to a direct provision centre.<\/p><p>  Since the Children First guidelines were introduced in 2011, some 171 referrals concerning children in direct provision have been made.  Parents are afraid to make complaints, as they do not trust the system or the State where they are located.  They essentially have to complain to the Department which is responsible for accommodating them as well as assessing their asylum applications.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister introduce a single procedure to decide on protection claims as a matter of urgency to reduce the amount of time people will have to spend in direct provision?  Will he ensure that the new legislation complies with various human rights instruments, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which forbids discrimination against children on the basis of the status of their parents?  This includes immigration status.  What steps will the Minister take to address the serious child protection concerns in direct provision centres?<\/p><p>  Has the Minister considered the recommendations by both national and international commentators on reviewing the direct provision system?  These include UN reports and the report of the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900032#FF00300","speaker":"1181"},{"type":"speech","time":1381327800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending to address this issue.  We have 4,600 asylum seekers in direct provision, costing the State &euro;62 million a year in 34 centres around the country.  I am concerned about recent reports which appeared in a newspaper on Monday which paint a very grim picture of some of these centres.  As I understand it, each centre is inspected three times a year.  The Refugee and Integration Agency carries out these inspections and some are outsourced to QTS Limited, which is a private company based in Galway.<\/p><p>  Part of the problem is that some people are living in direct provision for an average of three years and eight months, with many living in these conditions for up to seven years.  Initially it was envisaged that they would only be living in direct provision for six months.<\/p><p>  The legislation governing asylum is outdated and there appear to be many avenues to delay decisions for asylum seekers.  I recognise the enormous work the Minister has done in trying to speed up the process for many people.  As a result we now have far fewer asylum centres - down from 62 to 34.<\/p><p>I acknowledge there has been talk of new legislation with an immigration and refugee Bill to be published which might address some of these matters.  How does the Minister foresee the current problems being resolved?  As mentioned earlier, currently there are 4,600 people claiming asylum of which one third are children.  One of the issues in the report was that many of these children are being minded by older children and are unsupervised in the centres.  This is of concern to all of us from a health and safety perspective and for many other reasons.  I understand there is an average of approximately 1,000 new entrants every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900032#FF00400","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381328400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising what is an important issue.  The first thing to be highlighted about yesterday's report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which has been missed, is that it shows that the inspection regime put in place by the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department is working.  Finding things which are wrong and having them fixed is the purpose of a good inspection regime.  This is not in any way to seek to minimise the contents of the reports which of course are treated with the utmost seriousness by the staff of my Department who have the difficult job of operating the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible for the accommodation of 4,400 asylum seekers in 34 centres throughout 17 counties.  When the Government took up office in March 2011 that number was 5,900.  There has been a reduction of 25% over the past two and a half years.  RIA centres are occupied on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis.  The report in<i> The<\/i><i>Irish Times<\/i> was based on all inspection reports for seven specified centres over the course of 12 months and involved the release of 95 documents under freedom of information provisions.  While, naturally, the worst elements of these reports were highlighted, in fact most inspection reports are positive.  Again, this is not to minimise the content but to point out that they do not tell the full story.<\/p><p>  Contractors have an important duty to comply with the terms of contracts they enter into with the Reception and Integration Agency.  Some of the issues raised in these reports arise as a result of some residents unintentionally blocking fire exits, leaving children unattended, using rice cookers, etc.  The responsibility to look after the children rests in fact with the parents who are in the centres and they have responsibilities in this area.  I am not blaming the residents - far from it - but we should acknowledge that this is an ongoing challenge for staff working in the centres.<\/p><p>  All 34 asylum accommodation centres in the direct provision system are subject to a minimum of three unannounced inspections a year, one by an independent company, QTS Limited, under contract to the RIA and two by RIA officials.  In two serious cases 30-day notices were issued in which the contractor was told that the contract would be ended if problems were not rectified.  In both cases the problems were addressed within 48 hours, requiring the lifting of the 30-day notice.  Centres are also subject to inspection by fire officers and, in respect of food issues, to unannounced inspections by environmental health officers.  It is incorrect to say that staff are not vetted; they are vetted.  As part of their contractual obligations each centre must be inspected annually by a qualified and competent person with professional indemnity who must issue a certificate of compliance with regard to fire safety.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to overcrowding.  All RIA centres are subject to the requirements of the Housing Acts from 1996 to 2002.  Where a family increases in size to the point that these requirements are no longer met, alternative suitable accommodation is offered.  However, some families decline these offers and may decide to stay where they are until more spacious accommodation within an existing centre becomes available.<\/p><p>  The RIA has a robust child protection system.  The instances of children being left alone were dealt with immediately and education of parents and guardians with reference to their responsibilities is a key feature of any follow up.  In all cases, the primary carers for children are their parents.<\/p><p>  There was mention in the article of suicides being covered up.  That is untrue.  In the 14 years of RIA's existence only one person, a newly-arrived asylum seeker, can with certainty be said to have committed suicide and that happened while the individual was being detained in hospital.  It did not happen in one of the centres.<\/p><p>  Inspection templates have been changed and new training for staff took place earlier this year.  All completed inspections carried out from 1 October 2013 will be published on the RIA's website.  Transparency is important.  By &quot;completed&quot; I mean the inclusion of responses by contractors to the report's findings.  The RIA believes, as do I, that transparency is the key to maintaining standards.  Residents have been assured time and again that complaints under the RIA house rules are legitimate and will not adversely affect their protection claims or lead to unwanted transfers.  Any suggestions to the contrary are simply untrue and, unfortunately, may have the effect of dissuading residents from using the complaints mechanism in the way intended.<\/p><p>  The direct provision system seeks to ensure that the accommodation and ancillary services provided by the State meet the requirements of asylum seekers while their applications for international protection are being processed.  It is essentially a cashless system which provides them with full board accommodation free of utility or other costs.  While accommodation services are provided by RIA, other State supports are provided by the appropriate Department or agency.  For example, health services are provided through the HSE, social welfare supports through the Department of Social Protection and education through the Department of Education and Skills and so on.

I was asked to look at it from a Government perspective.  The reason there is an inspection system in place is in order that it is properly and adequately inspected and that where problems are identified, they are addressed.<\/p><p>That has been the consequence of the reports.  Moreover, the issues highlighted in these reports, where problems exist, have been addressed and I wish to be clear in that regard.<\/p><p> While the direct provision system is not ideal and I do not pretend it is, it facilitates the State in providing a roof over the heads of those seeking asylum or seeking on other grounds to be allowed to remain in the State and to so do in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances in which the State is in great financial difficulty.  There is no open-ended pot of money available to deal with and address this issue, as there is not to deal with a broad range of issues that affect citizens of the State.  More than 51,000 people have been accommodated in direct provision since early 2000 and, as I noted, 4,500 people are in the system at present.  Since then, no asylum seeker has been left homeless by the failure of the State to provide basic shelter or to meet basic needs.  It is of course to be expected that asylum seekers anywhere, if given a choice, would prefer to have independent accommodation, a right to welfare and work and so on instead of being restricted to a system of direct provision to meet their needs.  To avoid misunderstanding, it should be noted that all European Union member states operate systems for dealing with asylum seekers which, in one form or another, greatly restrict their access to welfare, work or independent housing.  The system in this State is at least on a par with, and often significantly better than, that in operation in many other states.  I freely admit the system has its faults but it is misleading to characterise our system of providing for asylum seekers in any way as grossly inadequate or inappropriate.  Within the financial constraints within which we must operate, I emphasise it guarantees that everyone claiming to be an asylum seeker who seeks to remain in the State is provided with a roof over his or her head if he or she is not in a position to provide it him or herself.<\/p><p> I accept Deputy Nulty's description of some of those who seek asylum.  Some come from terrible background circumstances where they are genuine asylum applicants who are entitled to be granted refugee status or are entitled to be allowed to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds.  However, some are economic migrants pretending to be asylum seekers.  Moreover, some arrive in the State pretending to originate from countries where there is war and strife but on investigation of their cases, it turns out they come from somewhere entirely different from the state they claimed to have been from.  I share the view that asylum seekers or those seeking to remain here should not be kept in the centres for the length of time that many are kept there at present.  However, the difficulty is with the current legal system in which there is a myriad of different applications that can be made.  They can take a substantial time and along each of the routes, when a decision is granted with which someone disagrees - I criticise no one for doing this - he or she can make applications for judicial review in the High Court.  There now are High Court lists such that regardless of whether one is a genuine asylum seeker who believes one's case is being dealt with inappropriately or is an economic migrant masquerading as an asylum seeker, everyone knows that if one applies for a judicial review, it may take one or two years before one's case is heard and one can remain in this State.<\/p><p> In these circumstances, it is not possible to state that after six months, people should go back into the workforce in circumstances in which more than 400,000 people are employed in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900033#GG00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381329000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>What of the reception directive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900034#HH00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1381329000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>However, I will conclude by noting that my objective is to introduce reforming legislation to which I am committed.

We should have begun the recording of the DNA of violent and repeat offenders a long time ago.  It also is welcome that it will assist in the identification of missing and unknown persons, including unidentified human remains.  Provided that appropriate privacy safeguards are included, DNA databases are indispensable crime-fighting weapons.  The appropriate use of profiles obtained from DNA samples can enable law enforcement officials to more rapidly eliminate innocent people from their inquiries.  There also is a theory that taking criminals' DNA samples actually will lower crime rates because such DNA samples will work as a deterrent by increasing the likelihood that a criminal will be convicted if he or she is caught.<\/p><p>  However, I have some concerns the Minister should address and I hope the Bill will not be open to abuse.  For example, it is critical that this proposed legislation has the necessary safeguards and procedures for destruction.  At present, approximately 30,000 DNA samples are being added to the United Kingdom's database each month.  Recently, the Supreme Court in the United States passed down a ruling stating it is legal to take DNA swabs from arrestees without a warrant on the grounds that a DNA check swab is similar to other common jailhouse procedures such as fingerprinting.  Some states in the United States have passed legislation requiring the collection of DNA samples from people convicted of some low-level crimes including shoplifting and drug possession.  I hope we do not reach a similar stage here in Ireland.  For instance, in the future will there be an extension of this Bill's provisions beyond its current inception?  I have no doubt but that the temptation may be there to expand the use of DNA databases.  I note, for instance, that over a ten-year period in the United States, law enforcement officials went from collecting DNA from convicted sex offenders to now doing so from people who have been arrested but have not been convicted of a crime.  This is the reason that while I consider the Bill to be worthy of support and I intend to support it, the civil liberties of individuals must be protected.<\/p><p>  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has raised some valid points regarding the Bill and I ask the Minister to consider them.  I refer in particular to the extent to which samples and DNA profiles generated from DNA samples may be transmitted to other states, including some outside the European Union.  While I missed the Minister's earlier comments in this regard, he might tell Members again whether samples will be transmitted to other states and if so, under what circumstances and whether they may be sent outside the European Union to, for instance, the United States.  I do not oppose the sending of samples under certain circumstances.  I refer to the example of a serious criminal on the run who may be known to be in a particular state but who cannot be found or, even if such an individual was arrested, there may not be sufficient evidence, whereas such evidence may exist in Ireland, perhaps through DNA testing of a crime he committed here.<\/p><p>I would not have a problem with it then being sent to that state but I would have serious problem if it were sent to states where human rights abuses are prevalent, and they are prevalent in many states.  There could be abuse in that respect in such an instance.  The Minister might clarify that area.<\/p><p> The Minister may have done this already but I ask that he consider referring the Bill for review to the Irish Human Rights Commission under section 8(<i>b<\/i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000.  Provided they include appropriate privacy safegrounds, DNA databases are indispensable crime fighting weapons.<\/p><p> I would not have a problem supporting the Bill once I had the Minister's assurance on the destruction over a period of time of the DNA that is collected and that the DNA samples would not be sent to inappropriate countries which have a very poor record in terms of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900034#HH01400","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381329600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill.  This is an important debate and we all need to seriously examine the proposals in the legislation.  We also need to be radical and to examine new methods of fighting crime in our society, but at all times we must have a system that is fair, transparent and accountable to the citizens of this State.  Our criminal justice system must have the confidence and respect of all our people because many have felt let down by the system in the past.  That is the reason we need urgent change, reform and modernisation to tackle crime and look after victims.  Their voices must be heard and forensic samples are very much part of that process.  I urge the Minister and the Government to listen more to our people, particularly those hurt or damaged by crime, especially serious crime.  There is always a good deal of talk inside and outside this House about crime and its effects and consequences, but we also need to talk more about the causes and prevention of crime and learn from the serious mistakes of the past.  Those considerations are relevant to this debate.  However, talk is not enough, we need action, professionalism and accountability.  We all need a justice system that works in the Ireland of 2013, and this where we begin.<\/p><p>  We have seen the horrific murders, gangland killings, rapes and assaults, and at times it is easy to throw our hands up and say: &quot;What can we all do?&quot;  That is not good enough.  This Bill presents an opportunity to deal comprehensively with the issue.  I hope it will deter and prevent crime and above all save lives in the future.<\/p><p>  There are 163 pages in the Bill and surely they will have a positive impact on this society that is crying out for help, and I emphasise &quot;crying&quot;.  People are at their wits end and it is up to us as legislators to act and reach our to our communities.  Overall, that is the reason, despite some minor concerns, I welcome the publication of this legislation and I will be supporting it.<\/p><p>  The legislation provides for the establishment and operation of a DNA database to assist the Garda in the investigation of crime and finding and identifying missing or unknown persons.  It updates the legal framework generally for the taking of forensic samples.  This is part of the modernisation of our justice system and of policing in this country.  That is a crucial part of this debate.  In addition, the Bill will also allow the State to meet its obligations under the EU Pr<font color=\"#222222\">&uuml;m Council decision and related EU and international instruments which provide a framework for the automated comparison for criminal investigation purposes of the DNA and fingerprint databases operated by member states.  That is an important part of the debate because we must get serious about dealing with crime in our modern society.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  Regarding the DNA database, the Bill provides for the taking of samples such as mouth swabs from the following for the purpose of generating a DNA profile in regard to the person for entry in the DNA database: most suspects, other than children under 14 years of age and vulnerable persons, detailed by the garda&iacute; in connection with serious offences - generally offences subject to a sentence of five years or more; offenders entered on the sex offenders register on, or after, commencement of the legislation; offenders subject to a sentence of imprisonment in regard to serious offences on, or after, commencement, whether they are in prison, on temporary release or otherwise; and some former offenders who are no longer subject to sentence.  That is what the DNA database is all about.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  I will zoom in on the section that deals with vulnerable persons.  While vulnerable suspects, persons who do not have the capacity by reason of a mental or physical disability to understand the general nature or effect of the taking of a sample or who cannot indicate their consent to the taking of a sample, and suspects under 14 years of age may not be sampled for the database, they may, however, be sampled where this is necessary to prove or disprove their involvement in a particular offence, that is, for evidential purposes.  There is an age threshold of 12 in regard to child suspects for the taking of evidential samples.  I welcome this section because it is important to zoom in on the protection of people with an intellectual disability and other vulnerable people in our society.  We have seen in recent months, in this city and elsewhere in the country, the attacks on people with an intellectual disability.  This is crime that is often forgotten about.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  Another issue, one from the past, is the sexual abuse of children with an intellectual disability, which has not been dealt with in this State.  We have dealt with many cases of child sexual abuse, but there are many hidden cases because of the intellectual capacity of young adults with an intellectual disability whose voices have not been heard.  It is important when we come to deal with this section that we ensure the protection of vulnerable persons with a physical or intellectual disability or other persons who do not have the capacity to deal with these complicated issues and that we deal with this in a professional and objective manner.  This is an important section of the legislation and I welcome this provision.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  Our justice system needs reform.  We have had a debate on reform of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il for the past few weeks but the justice system is in need of urgent reform.  I will accept this legislation.  If a Deputy, whether a member of a Government party or an Opposition party, puts forward a proposal, I, as an Independent Deputy, will support it if it deals specifically with a common-sense issue and provides for the modernisation of our judicial and justice systems.  We must also be vigilant because of our history and cases such as the Fr. Niall Molloy case or the James Sheehan case and the great work done by Gemma O'Doherty in regard to some of these cases.  We must also be cautious and concerned about abuses that have taken place.  I urge the Minister to be open to taking account of these issues and to the experience in other jurisdictions where major blunders have been made in regard to databases.  We must be cautious, as my colleague Deputy Halligan said, of the experience in the US, particularly in regard to low level crimes.  This legislation is a strong tool to deal with serious crimes such as sexual assault, sexual abuse or violent crimes.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  Other concerns have been raised, including the issue of samples being transmitted to other states.  We must be cautious about that.  I am not saying that we should not co-operate but we must ensure, if we are giving information, that it is not given to rogue states or to people who would use it for another agenda.  That is an important point.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  There are people in our society who have been let down.  I dealt with a case recently concerning Patrick J. Corrigan from Drumderglin, Carrigallen, County Leitrim, regarding an issue of allegations of white collar crime in respect of this old man in County Leitrim.  I urge the Minister and the Garda authorities to ensure this complaint is investigated and I have already raised this case with the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  The database will have two divisions, an investigation division and an identification division, reflecting their functions.  The investigation division will comprise a crime scene index, including profiles lifted from scenes prior to the enactment of the legislation, a reference index and elimination indexes.<\/font><\/p><p>The reference index will contain profiles developed from samples taken from suspects, offenders and any person who volunteers to have his or her profile entered on the index.  The elimination indexes will contain the profiles of persons whose work brings them into contact with crime scenes or items taken therefrom.  Examples in this regard include members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and staff of the Forensic Science Laboratory and I take this opportunity to commend both on the job they do.  The legislation will provide the professionals to whom I refer with another tool to assist them in their work.  The Bill also includes extensive safeguards in respect of the taking of samples, particularly from children and other vulnerable persons, and in the context of the operation of the DNA database in order to ensure the integrity of the system.<\/p><p> The Bill will repeal the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 and it will also end the common law regime relating to the taking of samples from suspects for evidential purposes which has operated in parallel to the 1990 Act in an unregulated manner.  The Bill will replace these parallel regimes with an updated statute-only regime.  This is a very positive aspect of the legislation.<\/p><p> The Bill also deals with the destruction of samples and it is important that we engage in a close examination of this aspect.  The Bill provides for the destruction of samples taken from suspects, prisoners etc. for the purpose of generating DNA profiles for the DNA database, as soon as the profile has been generated or in any case within six months.  The destruction of these samples will have no effect on the usefulness of the database because it is only the profile that is required for the database.  In the context of a presumption in favour of removal from the database of the DNA profiles of suspects who are not convicted and subject to the Garda Commissioner having the power to authorise retention on the database where he is satisfied that this is necessary, a statutory test will be established whereby the Commissioner will make his decision.  His decision will be open to appeal.  The retention periods allowed will be six years in the case of adults and three years in the case of children.  Given that senior garda&iacute; are often obliged to act in the national interest and in the interests of the justice system, the relevant section of the Bill is, therefore, extremely important.  I welcome the fact the Commissioner's decision will be open to appeal if serious issues of concern arise.<\/p><p> Revised arrangements for the retention of samples taken for evidential purposes include a presumption in favour of destruction of the samples relating to suspects who are not convicted subject to the Garda Commissioner having the power to authorise retention for 12 months, which will be renewable, where he is satisfied this is necessary.  A statutory test will be set out and it will be by means of this that the Garda Commissioner will make his decision.  Again, that decision will be open to appeal.  The Commissioner will also have the option of applying to the District Court to retain profiles on the database beyond the periods to which I refer in circumstances where he has good reason to do so.  This is an important aspect of the Bill and I welcome it.  The DNA profiles of persons convicted of serious offences will be held on the database indefinitely.  The emphasis in this regard must be on serious offences rather than low-level crimes.<\/p><p> I like the idea of the oversight committee.  In order to ensure the integrity of the DNA database and the information it will generate, the Bill provides for its management and operation to be overseen by an independent committee which will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court.  The membership of the committee will include a person nominated by of the Data Protection Commissioner, which is vital.<\/p><p> The Bill also provides for the Forensic Science Laboratory of the Department of Justice and Equality to host and manage the database.  This is a massive responsibility.  Pending the enactment of the legislation, the laboratory has undertaken a substantial amount of preparatory work including putting in place the software on which the database will sit.  Apart from the preparatory work relating to the physical establishment of the database, other work will also be required in respect of the commencement of the legislation.  I refer here to the preparation of regulations and codes of practice relating to the taking of samples by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prisoner officers, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission etc.  It is envisaged that this work will proceed in tandem with the enactment of the legislation in order to ensure there will be no undue delay in the database becoming operational.  The groundwork relating to the establishment of the DNA database has already been done.  I welcome this because it is important to be prepared and professional when it comes to fighting crime.<\/p><p> I welcome the broad thrust of the legislation.  However, I ask the Minister to consider the concerns which I and a number of my colleagues have raised.  What is being done here represents a positive step forward and, as a result, I will be supporting the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900035#JJ00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381330200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>As I mentioned in the recent debate on the freedom of information legislation, our society is at a critical juncture.  With the advent of new technologies that are having a massive impact on how societies are informed, monitored and organised, an extensive international discussion is taking place in respect of the role of government in people's lives and how it relates to the privacy of the state's citizens and, ultimately, how government would appear in a genuinely democratic state.  Only a week after the debate to which I refer, it is ironic that we have been presented with a Bill in which it is proposed that technology be used to infringe on the civil liberties and privacy of the people of this country.<\/p><p>  Although the introduction of DNA evidence into criminal justice systems has largely been a success - it has been used to convict the guilty and free the innocent on countless occasions - new developments in DNA science and the expansion of DNA collection by states must give us pause for thought and create the opportunity for a wider debate on the role biological technologies should play in our lives.  Article 40.3.1o of the Constitution states &quot;The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen&quot;, while Article 40.5 states &quot;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.&quot;<\/p><p>  US courts have consistently found that the collection and analysis of one's DNA constitutes a search for two reasons.  First, bodily - or at least tissue - intrusion is necessary for DNA extraction.  Second, is the substantial and uniquely personalised nature of the information contained in DNA.  At the same time, the US courts have upheld the operation of convicted-offender DNA databases, including the forcible extraction and banking of DNA, for two reasons, namely, because the government's interest is one of special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement or as a result of the fact that convicted criminals have a diminished expectation of privacy as balanced against society's need to promote law and order.  Arguably, the role of DNA databases for convicted criminals is for precise identification and for helping police solve recidivist crimes.  However, the position is changing fast in states across the US.  Since June of this year, US authorities have been given blanket justification in the context of collecting and using DNA evidence without limits.<\/p><p>  I have read the Bill and it appears the Minister wants to follow the example of our friends across the Atlantic, even though it would be wise to look more sceptically at, rather than ape, a justice system which manages to lock up one quarter of the world's prisoners in a country which is home to only 5% of the world's population.  It is clear from section 9 that the Minister proposes to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the right to take DNA samples by force, if necessary, from any person, unless he or she is a child or has been classified insane, who has the misfortune to be detained by garda&iacute;.  It appears the Minister wants to build up the DNA database as quickly as possible, with scant regard for whether citizens whose information will be placed on it have committed crimes.<\/p><p>  While the prevailing notion with respect to DNA databases is &quot;the bigger the better&quot;, it is worth noting that the ability to use DNA in solving crime is limited by the ability to collect uncontaminated and undegraded DNA at crime scenes and not by the number of names in the database.  As databases are expanded to include people convicted of minor offences or who were merely arrested, the chances that any given profile in the database will help resolve future crimes apparently diminish.  In the UK, the enactment of arrestee testing in 2004 corresponded with the number of profiles on the UK database increasing from 2 million to 3 million, including those of more than 125,000 people never charged with any crime, in a three-year period.  This, in turn, has corresponded with a slight decrease in the number of matches with crime scene evidence.<\/p><p>I draw the Minister's attention to a recent report in <i>The Guardian<\/i>which revealed that the DNA of thousands of innocent children in Britain is being taken by police and stored on a national database.  Police have taken the DNA of 120,000 children in the past two years.  According to the figures obtained by the Howard League for Penal Reform, a total of 4,000 children under the age of 13 had their DNA taken in 2011.  Police can take DNA from anyone arrested and store it on a database even if he or she is not charged or convicted of a criminal offence.  The Howard League for Penal Reform states that a child's DNA is being taken by the police in Britain once every ten minutes.<\/p><p> A number of civil liberty issues arise.  The first and most obvious is the subject of individual privacy.  The taking of a DNA sample from an innocent person can be seen as the equivalent of an unwarranted search thus violating his or her personal rights, according to our Constitution.  It is also important to note that DNA collection is not the same, in principle, as the widely accepted practice of collecting and databanking fingerprints.  A recent report by the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy clearly outlined the differences and potential dangers of expansive DNA collection as opposed to fingerprinting.  It stated:<blockquote>By contrast, DNA, which must be extracted from a tissue sample and mined for data, contains exactly the kind of information that raises privacy and other civil liberties concerns.  Research conducted to expand our knowledge of what can be revealed by examining a person's DNA continues; as of this writing, samples of DNA can provide insights into familial connections, physical attributes, genetic mutations, ancestry and disease predisposition.  As science advances, the phenotypic information available from human DNA will necessarily grow.  Genetic information could be used in discriminatory ways and may include information that the person whose DNA it is does not wish to know.  Repeated claims that human behaviors such as aggression, substance addiction, criminal tendency, and sexual orientation can be explained by genetics render law enforcement's collection, use and retention of DNA potentially prone to abuse.<\/blockquote> A second problem with the proposed Bill and its intent to take DNA from innocent citizens is that it marks a fundamental shift in the function and intended purpose of what has been termed &quot;criminal databanks&quot;.  The routine trawling of these databases by garda&iacute; makes the people whose personal data are included into suspects for all future crimes even though there is no method, reason or actual substantial police work which would make them suspects under any other circumstances.  This process was clearly put in the wider context by the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy when it stated:<blockquote>Requiring persons convicted of a crime to forfeit certain rights of bodily integrity and privacy while under authority of the penal system has been ruled defensible.  However, subjecting those who have <i>never <\/i>been suspected of a crime, let alone convicted of one, to this treatment potentially undermines the presumption of innocence.  Adding the DNA data from millions of innocent persons to these databanks alters their purpose from one of criminal investigation to population surveillance, subverting our deepest notions of a free and autonomous citizenry.<\/blockquote> Part 10 of the Bill goes into some detail in regard to the retention and destruction of DNA samples and DNA profiles.  It seems to be the case that the Commissioner may, under certain circumstances, extend the period of retention for up to six years in the case of a sample that is taken from an innocent person.  This is obviously a worst case scenario but reading between the lines of the Bill, this possibility exists.  Also, in certain cases, there seems to be an emphasis on the responsibility of the owners of the DNA to make requests that the DNA sample or profile be destroyed.<\/p><p> Ultimately, given the general lack of transparency, which the Government intends to enshrine in the provisions contained in the new freedom of information legislation, and of accountability surrounding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is fair to be sceptical about what will happen to our DNA samples once they are in the hands of the State.<\/p><p> I re-emphasise the point that this treatment potentially undermines the presumption of innocence.  Adding the DNA data of millions of innocent persons to these databanks alters its purpose from one of criminal investigation to population surveillance.  There was a time when states kept people who they had genuine reason to be suspicious of as being engaged in illegal activities under surveillance.  We have seen from many of the revelations from WikiLeaks and, more recently, from Edward Snowden that the days of keeping tabs on those suspected of illegal activity seems to be diminishing.  Now we seem more content to keep data on just about everybody, about which I have concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900036#KK00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381330800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The Bill seeks to provide for the establishment, management and oversight of a DNA database system, which will be used in criminal investigations and also to assist in finding missing persons and identifying unknown persons.  The Bill provides for the taking of samples for the purpose of the DNA database system.  It also seeks to replace the existing statutory and common law arrangements for the taking of samples for forensic testing and for use as evidence in criminal investigations and proceedings with an updated statute only regime.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the taking of samples, mouth swaps and hair follicles from the following for the purpose of generating a DNA profile in regard to the person for entry into the DNA database: most suspects, other than children under 14 years of age and vulnerable persons, detained by garda&iacute; in connection with serious offences - generally offences subject to a sentence of five years or more; offenders entered on the sex offenders register on or after the commencement of the legislation; offenders subject to a sentence of imprisonment in regard to serious offences on or after commencement, whether they are in prison, on temporary release or otherwise; and some former offenders who are no longer subject to sentence.<\/p><p>  The difference between a DNA sample and profile is pivotal.  A DNA sample contains an individual genome - the brain of the cell - which contains an individual's entire genetic information.  However, a DNA profile consists of taking points from particular points in an individual's DNA sample.  Therefore, the retention of a DNA does not raise the same ethical consideration as the retention of a DNA sample.<\/p><p>  In regard to the retention of data, the Bill sets out retention periods for both DNA samples and profiles.  Where certain circumstances arise, a sample must, if not previously destroyed, be destroyed before the expiry of three months from the date on which the specified circumstances first applied.  In certain circumstances, the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may authorise the extension of the period by a further 12 months.  In regard to samples taken from suspects, offenders and former offenders for the purpose of generating a profile for the entry into the DNA database system, such samples must, if not previously destroyed, be destroyed as soon as a DNA profile is generated from the sample or within six months of the taking of the sample whichever is the later.<\/p><p>  In regard to the DNA profile, where a suspect is not proceeded against or convicted, the Garda Commissioner has the power to authorise retention of a profile on the database, where he has determined this is necessary, up to a maximum of six years in the case of an adult and three years in the case of a child.  A decision to extend the retention period may be appealed to the District Court.  The Garda Commissioner can apply to the District Court to retain profiles beyond the above mentioned periods where there is a good reason to do so.<\/p><p>  Some of the positive implications of the establishment of a DNA database, as envisaged by the Bill, include the potential to investigate and solve crime and the establishment of the innocence of those wrongly convicted.  The discovery of DNA profiling has had an enormous impact on modern policing and is commonly referred to as the gold standard for identification.  In light of the increasing use of the technique in police practice, on 5 February 2003, the then Attorney General, Rory Brady SC, requested the Law Reform Commission to consider the establishment of a DNA databank.  As part of the consideration, the commission was requested to consider the constitutional human rights issues that may raise as well as formulating proposals for reform.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure the integrity of the DNA database and information it generates, the Bill provides for the management and operation of the database to be overseen by an independent committee that will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the High Court or Circuit Court.  Its membership will include a nominee of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900037#LL00200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1381331400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Harnessing scientific developments for the good of society is a key element of scientific advancement.  This Bill seeks to do that by providing for the compilation of a database that will become a key tool in the fight against serious crime.  As criminals are keeping abreast of developments in science and technology, police forces and justice enforcement systems must do likewise.  Ireland is not alone in facing the questions posed by scientific advancement.  This Bill will allow the State to meet its obligations under the EU Pr&uuml;m Council decision which allows for comparisons to be made between databases compiled by various member states for the purposes of criminal investigation.  In an increasingly globalised world, we have to take account of the ability of criminals to move from one jurisdiction to another.  The compilation of a database of key individual signifiers, such as DNA and fingerprints, is just one crucial tool in the fight against national and international crime.<\/p><p>  Under the Bill, most subjects detained by the Garda in connection with serious crime will have a DNA swab sample taken.  Offenders on the sex offenders register will also have samples taken but only from the time the legislation takes effect.  Children under the age of 14 and vulnerable people are excluded from the requirement to have samples taken, but this is not the case where such a sample would prove or disprove the person's involvement in a crime.  This is a sensible measure.  It is interesting to note that the database will also include profiles taken from scenes prior to the enactment of the legislation.  An elimination index will includes samples from people whose work brings them into contact with crime scenes, which means that garda&iacute; and staff of the Forensic Science Laboratory will have samples taken as part of this database.<\/p><p>  The development of this databank also introduces the possibility of establishing the innocence of people who have been wrongly convicted.  Where possible, profiles relating to missing persons will be compiled by using profiles from their relatives.  Ill people who are unable to identify themselves will also have samples taken.  On a number of occasions in recent years, the bodies of Irish people who died in the Irish Sea have turned up in Wales or England.  It is to be hoped that this database will greatly reduce the extremely stressful time that families of missing people endure while waiting to find out if the deceased person is their missing loved one.  While samples taken for the database will be destroyed within six months, each profile will be retained on the database.  I welcome the fact that suspects who are not convicted can have their DNA profiles removed from the database after six years.  This provision is subject to the agreement of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>  Of course, the creation of a database of this nature raises many questions.  For that reason, I welcome the significant oversight that is provided for in the Bill, including the establishment of an oversight committee to be chaired by a judge or former judge of the High Court or Circuit Court.  Such a proviso is necessary to ensure proper oversight of this important database.  Ten years have passed since the Attorney General asked the Law Reform Commission to consider the establishment of a DNA databank.  The intervening decade has seen many advancements in the area of DNA identification and a number of high-profile cases in Ireland.  The passing of that decade gave Irish legislators an opportunity to benefit from test cases taken against such databases in Europe.  I refer in particular to a case in which the European Court of Human Rights found that the retention by the authorities in England and Wales of the profiles of people who were subsequently acquitted violated their rights.  Such decisions were taken into account in the drafting of the Irish legislation.<\/p><p>  Much consideration has been given to the human rights of the suspects from whom samples are taken.  This is right and proper.  The real benefit of this database is that it will allow for the detection of the criminals responsible for undetected crimes.  Historically in Ireland, many rapists have got away with their crimes because there was no evidence to link them to their victims.  Many grievous assaults were never properly punished because no individual link was found between the perpetrator and the victim.  I hope this Bill will result in the detection of many more crimes.  Perhaps it will serve as a deterrent in some cases if criminals believe there is an increased likelihood of being apprehended for crimes.  The incorporation into Irish law of this Bill, which is at least a decade in the making, will represent a significant step forward in the fight against crime in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900038#MM00100","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1381331400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Approximately a month after I was elected to the D&aacute;il, I was approached by a Garda superintendent from the north west of Cork city who is one of Ireland's finest garda&iacute;.  He suggested that if we could do anything at all in government to assist the work of the garda&iacute; in preventing and solving crimes, we should facilitate the development of a DNA database.  Following that conversation, I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, who has been a reforming and hard-working Minister by any yardstick.  Deputies do not need to be reminded of the amount of legislation he has put through.  I was informed that additional funding would be required by the Forensic Science Laboratory before any legislation could be proceeded with.  I am glad to see that has happened.  As a result, we are debating this Bill on Second Stage.  The superintendent I mentioned told me that the resources being used by the Garda to investigate new crimes - I refer to the collection of evidence such as DNA samples - was placing an enormous strain on the force.  He said that the time lost while garda&iacute; investigated evidence that could be kept on a database not only represented a waste of Garda resources and time, but also placed Irish citizens at risk because it gave rise to the potential for other crimes to be committed while these investigations continued.<\/p><p>  I would like to mention another meeting I had with a constituent on this issue.  A man who came into my office told me he was accused ten years ago of committing a sexual offence, but was not charged or tried.  Contrary to the suggestion that no database is available, this man has told me that every time an incident takes place within a certain geographical area, he is contacted by garda&iacute; and required to provide DNA evidence once again.  As he is keen to ensure he can be eliminated from Garda inquiries at an early stage, he has suggested that his DNA could be permanently stored on a database.  He protests his innocence of the original crime and any subsequent crime.  Of course I have no way of knowing whether he is guilty.  The presumption of innocence that applies to every person should be protected.  While I accept that some civil liberties arguments can be made in this respect, in most cases the need to prevent crime and support and protect the victims of crime has to trump any other concerns we might have.  I consider myself a strong supporter of civil liberties, but I do not accept the argument that DNA profiling, which is one of the modern benefits of science, is significantly different from fingerprinting.  We must use the scientific tools that are available to us.<\/p><p>  I would like to consider the potential for this database to be broadened, for example in the cases of people who are prepared to make voluntary submissions, although I am happy to bow to the Minister's superior knowledge in this regard.  It is clear that the area of intellectual difficulties is an extremely sensitive one.  It is important to remember that such difficulties can and should be taken into account during court cases and when it comes to sentencing.  I am not persuaded that this argument should apply fully when one is taking about means of taking evidence that are not particularly invasive, particularly if they may result in ruling somebody out of a crime.  If a person with intellectual difficulties has committed a crime, I suggest those difficulties should be taken account during the court case rather than in the collection of evidence.<\/p><p>  I will be interested to see how the six-year rule and the provision relating to the Commissioner will work out over time.  Anybody who has not committed a crime and does not intend to commit a crime should be afraid of his or her DNA profile being available on a database for five years to be assessed in cases of serious crime.  When I listened to Deputies speaking about the use of the DNA database to establish the identities of people who are found at sea, it struck me that the only circumstances in which this will happen under the current legislation will be if the person in question had been suspected of committing a serious crime.  Of course the vast majority of people who are found in such circumstances will not be on such a database.  My good friend who works for the Garda in the north west of Cork city - I will not name him - told me he wanted a database of this nature to be established to help him to do his job as a policeman better.  I am glad that legislation to that effect is being introduced.  I compliment the Minister on bringing it to this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900038#MM00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1381331400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to add my voice in support of the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013.<\/p><p>The Bill is yet another piece in the agenda to reform our justice system that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter is pursuing and, with that reform agenda in mind, I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his successful steering of the Court of Appeal referendum.  It marks a significant leap forward in the use of modern science and how forensic information can be used with confidence as a tool in crime prevention, criminal investigation and, crucially, the identification of individuals and in assisting missing persons investigations.<\/p><p> Like Deputy Murphy, I accept that people may have legitimate civil liberty concerns.  However, to sit in this Chamber and hear Members make comparisons with or link the Bill to WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden and the likes is a step too far.  At a time when criminals are using technology and science to their advantage, for the criminal  justice system and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to use it to the advantage of the common good would seem absurd.<\/p><p> I appreciate people's legitimate questions, so I am pleased that the Minister has effectively addressed many of those concerns in the Bill.  The measures on the destruction of samples and the removal of profiles from the DNA database in particular should alleviate many such concerns.  The creation of the oversight committee with responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the database and its information, and the fact that the committee would be chaired by a member of the Judiciary and, indeed, be linked to the Data Protection Commissioner, is welcome.  That gets the balance correct between the civil liberties concerns and the absolute importance of using every possible tool that we can to protect the people, and to bring those who commit crimes to justice, to support the families of missing persons and in trying to bring successful conclusions to those investigations.<\/p><p> The Bill updates the legal framework on which forensic samples are taken and lays out a clear platform of action in which individuals would be subject to the provision of forensic material, and specifically those who are suspected of crimes with a sentence in excess of five years and offenders on the sex offenders register.  We are concerned here with serious crimes.  <\/p><p> I am also pleased to see that provisions are included to ensure that vulnerable and young people would not be automatically subjected to the register.  I welcome that protection measure - it fully reflects the decisions made by the people on child protection, as evidenced by previous referenda and legislation.  The extensive safeguards contained in the Bill should reassure those who have legitimate concerns about data integrity or privacy, while rubbishing those who intend to engage in hyperbole and other such statements.  The Bill, which is designed to significantly improve the use of forensic information, is clearly needed.  As Deputy Connaughton alluded to, it is a Bill we have been looking for and in need of for more than a decade.<\/p><p> The Bill is also welcome because of the positive impact it will have in assisting in the investigations of missing persons.  The fact there is a planned division between both the investigation and the identification divisions of the database will provide assurance that identification of missing persons and their safe return is considered seriously.  It will greatly support the Garda and give assurances to the families of missing persons that we are doing everything that we possibly can in the legislation to use all tools available to bring their missing persons home or, at the least, to bring a conclusion to any sad tragedy that visits those families.<\/p><p> We have waited an extended period - more than a decade - for this comprehensive and effective Bill that would provide a DNA database while providing private citizens with protection on data and sensitive information.  The Bill will make a substantial and beneficial change to the efforts to identify criminals, to bring people to justice, to tackle serious crime and to help find missing persons.  I commend the Minister and his officials, whom I know have been working on the legislation for a long time.

The Bill is not before its time - this is the third attempt to bring a Bill like this to fruition.  It is important and necessary legislation and will be an invaluable tool in the fight against crime and in establishing the innocence of individuals and the identity of missing persons.  It is sensitive legislation.  Like all legislation in this area, it may well be prone to abuse and it is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that strong safeguards are included regarding privacy, civil liberties and self-incrimination.  On a first reading, it would appear that is the case.  I would hope that during the course of the Bill's progress through the House those matters will be clarified and we will be satisfied to put into place legislation that, on the one hand, strikes a balance between the rights of the individual to privacy, bodily integrity and privilege against self-incrimination and, on the other, the wider interests of society in both the prevention and solving of crime.<\/p><p>  A number of issues have been raised about the Bill, some of which need to be looked at and clarified further.  DNA profiling is commonly referred to as the gold standard for identification and we hope this turns out to be case and that the legislation is a success.  I welcome the statement by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre: &quot;We believe that not only will the DNA database help apprehend more perpetrators of sexual crimes in particular, but we hope that it will also act as a deterrent for potential perpetrators.&quot;  Professor David McConnell, Professor of Genetics at Trinity College Dublin also said: &quot;While some may see it as a danger, I believe it will actually add to our civil liberties because it will make it easier to identify culprits and exclude innocent suspects... It also greatly accelerates the administration of justice.&quot;  I hope that will also turns out to be the case.<\/p><p>  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has raised the issue of international exchange and co-operation, and there are concerns in this area.  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation on Committee Stage.  The possibility of our DNA database being available, for example, to rogue states is not something that we would want to facilitate.  Mass screening also needs to be looked at.  I am not sure that the Garda is the appropriate authority to initiate mass screening, although the Law Reform Commission has said that would be appropriate. <\/p><p>  I wish to refer more generally to the question of crime prevention.  While this Bill will, hopefully, be an invaluable tool and a deterrent in the prevention of crime, we should never forget the real measures that will prevent crime are social ones - job creation, the elimination of poverty and proper education and health services and community facilities.<\/p><p>These are the real areas that need to be tackled to ensure crime is prevented because prevention is obviously better than cure and is also far less costly.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, community policing has taken on a lower profile in recent years.  This area needs to be strengthened and resourced properly.  I know that on the ground, community policing and community garda&iacute; have lost individuals who have not been replaced.  There is not the same involvement with local communities as there has been in the past.  The local community garda on the beat dealing daily with young people, youth clubs and community organisations is invaluable.  Community garda&iacute; prevent a significant amount of crime taking place and effectively save the State a significant amount of money.  Unfortunately, it is quite clear that in recent years, with the lack of recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the loss of posts in this area, it is now being done on a part-time, on-call basis where garda&iacute; have other responsibilities that are seen as a priority.  The same effort and connection with local communities and young people and identifying local young people likely to become involved in anti-social behaviour are not being developed.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at this area again to ensure it is strengthened and that resources are put into it because prevention is better than cure.  It is far less costly than the cure.  I hope the Minister will engage directly in the area of community garda&iacute; and policing.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and hope it will be an invaluable tool in the fight against crime and in the establishment of the innocence of people and the identity of missing persons.  I hope there will be a balance between that and the necessary safeguards for the privacy and civil liberties of individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900039#NN00400","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381332600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Healy and the Technical Group for giving me some of their speaking time to speak on this very important Bill.  Despite the fact that he is not listening, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Minister's work in this regard and thank him and his officials for the excellent work they have done in producing this Bill.  It is wanted and needed and will be beneficial to the Garda.  The positive implications of it include the establishment of a DNA database and the potential to investigate and solve crimes and establish the innocence of those who are wrongly accused of crimes.  It is a very worthwhile Bill.  I have studied it and appreciate every bit of it.  I believe that in times to come, people will look back on the Minister and the people who worked with him and say that this was a very worthwhile document and piece of work.<\/p><p>  When we are dealing with a Bill such at this, and I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate this, we must look at everything in conjunction and tie it all up.  What we are doing here is solving crimes.  We are trying to establish guilt and innocence where they obtain.  To do all of this, one needs a knowledge of policing and what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does every day, be it at superintendent, detective, Garda sergeant or rank and file Garda level.  From a garda who might be on patrol in Dublin or some part of rural west Cork or south Kerry, one must encompass the whole thing and look at it as a collective picture of trying to fight crime.  Unfortunately, this Minister, perhaps more than many others, is faced with the terribly difficult task of dealing with criminals who are highly resourced and imaginative and who have every facility at their disposal.  That is why now more than ever before, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a really tough and difficult time.<\/p><p>  I am very sorry, Minister, but it is like talking to a wall.  It is a very difficult thing to talk to a Minister when he is on his mobile telephone, which he was when my colleagues were speaking previously.

I commend the Minister on the effort he has put into his role.  We may disagree on many occasions about other aspects of his understanding of policing.

The closure of Garda stations has led to a lack of connectivity between senior garda&iacute; and garda&iacute; on the beat, particularly in regard to rural crime.  We were told that Garda vans would be made available to our communities.  We welcomed that in a limited way because we thought it might compensate for the loss of rural Garda stations.  Recently, however, the Minister stated in a reply to a parliamentary question that the proposal had been scrapped.  I did not believe it would ever happen and unfortunately I was proven correct.<\/p><p>  It is now being suggested that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might make use of rural post offices.  I would thank the Minister if this initiative is implemented, as would the people of Ireland.  The excellent Bill before us would work in conjunction with such an initiative to solve crime.  At the end of the day it is all about the massive fight of right against wrong.  I will support the Minister in any initiative he might take on these people but I will not pussy-foot about if I think he is doing something wrong.  Nobody will take his work ethic away from him.  Everybody knows about his work ethic.  I like people who genuinely work and I will fully support him because he is giving it 120% and more.<\/p><p>  It is important that the Garda co-operates with police forces in other jurisdictions given what can happen in regard to the abduction of children when relationships break down.  Such problems arise in Ireland on a monthly basis.  It is important that the Bill is implemented as a matter of urgency because it might help to solve these problems.  A number of people have disappeared over the past several years and their families live with the constant torture of not knowing what happened to them.  It is awful to think of a person being killed but at least one knows that has happened.  However, if a person disappears without account it creates a horror and anguish that haunts relatives every day of the week.  Anything in this Bill that might help in cases of disappeared persons must be welcomed.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister and his officials for their work.  I might be critical at times but my criticism is measured.  In regard to the issues we fought over in the past, unfortunately I have been proved right and the Minister wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900041#PP00800","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1381333200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House during the term of this Government.  The consequences of having a DNA database will be felt acutely in the area of solving serious crime.  I cannot understand why legislation of this nature was not enacted during the time of plenty of the Celtic tiger era.<\/p><p>  A strand of DNA contains the essence of life.  Each living thing has its own distinguishing brand of DNA and, therefore, it can be used as a tool to identify each of us by our own unique code.  This is why it is used by police forces across the world to fight serious crime.  The largest database in the world is in the US and since 1994 that database has been used on over 200,000 occasions to assist in 192,000 investigations.  In a specific case study in the city of Denver, it was found that of all the cases taken for the single crime of burglary, 76% would not have been taken to court by the district attorney but for DNA evidence.  It has since emerged that where DNA testing is done in cases of crimes against property, such as burglary, twice as many cases have been accepted for prosecution.  Using DNA, as opposed to simply fingerprinting, is five times more likely to allow investigators to identify a suspect.  DNA is a bit like a fingerprint in that we all have a different set-up but the DNA we all carry can never be changed.<\/p><p>  One of the key innovations in this Bill is the establishment of a database to assist the Garda in tackling crime.  When the database is operational it will have the capacity to link crimes and identify suspects in unsolved crimes.  It will enable the Garda to be more efficient in investigations and make better use of resources.  It will also give a new impetus to the investigation of crimes which may have occurred some time ago.  Several years ago a forward thinking garda kept some forensic samples from a murder case on record.  His actions led to the conviction of the murderer several years later.  The Bill allows for samples taken from a crime scene, such as a strand of hair, tiny pieces of skin or drops of blood, to be sampled, identified and entered into a database that allows investigators to compare the information and match it to anything they may have on the system, thereby potentially establishing someone's presence at a crime scene.<\/p><p>  The database can also allow the Garda to link with international police forces and their databases to determine whether samples taken here match those of anyone who has committed a crime in other jurisdictions.  Similarly, if a crime is committed in the UK or further abroad, samples can be matched to the Irish database.<\/p><p>  The proposed database will contain the genetic profiles of most people convicted of serious offences which attract prison sentences of five years or more and will include those found guilty of rape and most other sexual offences.  Children under the age of 14 years will not be included.  The database will also include individuals listed in the sex offenders register on or after the commencement of the legislation, as well as certain former offenders who are no longer in prison.  The Bill provides for the removal of profiles and the destruction of samples taken from people who have not been convicted of any prescribed crime.  This is an aspect that some people might overlook.  The database can not only establish an individual's participation in a crime, but can also prove his or her innocence.  <\/p><p>  I have long campaigned for the establishment of a DNA database.  Last year, I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to retain blood samples and other medical evidence taken from newborn babies for use in finding out more about diseases.  These samples could also provide the basis for a DNA database.  I am glad that the Minister of State agreed to my request because the samples provided invaluable information.<\/p><p>I am glad to contribute on this Bill.  Legislation that governs issues surrounding DNA and crime is a sensitive issue, one that involves balancing the need to conduct effective criminal investigations with the need to protect human rights and civil liberties.  The enactment of this legislation is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  When up and running, the database will have the capacity to link crimes and identify suspects in unsolved crimes.  This will enable the Garda to conduct better investigations and make better use of resources.  In addition, making use of such database technology in the forensics field has the added benefit of facilitating the searching, subject to strict conditions, of other national DNA databases.<\/p><p> In introducing this legislation, the Minister stated that it would fully respect human rights.  I believe that this will be done.  The Bill provides for the taking, subject to appropriate safeguards, of biological samples in the form of mouth swabs or hair follicles from suspects and convicted persons, including sex offenders, from which their DNA profiles will be generated for entry in the database.  Crime scene profiles from unsolved crimes, whether occurring before or after the new legislation becomes law, will also be entered in the database.<\/p><p> The actual data will be held on purpose-built software already in use by agencies around the world.  This software is used in more than 40 countries, including 18 EU member states.  It was installed in the Forensic Science Laboratory in 2012.<\/p><p> The level of intelligence that will be generated by a DNA database will be invaluable to the Garda in identifying offenders involved in crimes such as burglary.  It will also have a major impact in terms of serious offences against the person, such as homicides and sexual offences.  It will contribute to the move towards more effective, targeted and smarter policing operations and will also facilitate co-operation with other police forces across the world.<\/p><p> In addition to benefiting criminal investigations, the database will be of benefit in identifying missing and unknown persons, for example, unidentified human remains or the victims of natural or man-made disasters.  It is also important to point out that the database will be of benefit in establishing the innocence of persons suspected or wrongly convicted of offences and will help in preventing miscarriages of justice.  These important points should be clearly stated.<\/p><p> The Bill published today has been substantially amended in many respects to address issues that gave rise to genuine concerns, for example, the sensitive question of the retention of samples and DNA profiles of persons who are not subsequently convicted, in order to ensure that any interference with privacy rights is justified by the public interest in the investigation of crime and is proportionate.<\/p><p> Clear terms govern the level of information that is to be given to a person before a sample is taken in the case of compulsory samples and before consent is sought in the case of voluntary samples.  The types of samples that may be taken from persons for the purpose of the database are restricted to the least intrusive samples &ndash; mouth swabs or plucked head hair.  Draft codes of practice for the purpose of giving practical guidance on the procedures for the taking of samples under the Bill are to be drawn up by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Irish Prison Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, for approval by the Minister.  These codes will be published.<\/p><p> A high offence threshold for the taking of samples from suspects and offenders applies.  Generally, samples may only be taken for the purpose of the database or for evidential purposes in respect of offences having a penalty of five years imprisonment or more.  Where reasonable force may be used to take a sample, it requires prior authorisation of an officer of at least superintendent rank and its use must also be observed by a senior person who has responsibility for determining how many officers are required.  It must be electronically recorded.<\/p><p> There are special safeguards for protected persons and children who are suspects.  Protected persons will not be subject to sampling for the purposes of the database, but evidential samples may be taken where required.  Children under 14 years of age will not be subject to sampling for the purposes of the database, but evidential samples may be taken where required.  The position with regard to children aged 14 years and older is to be reviewed within six years.  Reasonable force may not be used to take a database sample from a child suspect.<\/p><p> Information is to be given in a language and manner appropriate to the protected person and is to be age appropriate.  Provision is made for a person other than a member of the Garda to be present when a sample is being taken from a protected person or child.  This person may be a parent, guardian, adult relative or a person nominated by the member in charge.  Such persons are also to be given the information that is required to be given to the protected person or child.  Special provision is made in respect of the giving of consent on behalf of protected persons or children for the taking of intimate samples where required for evidential purpose.  In certain circumstances, a District Court order may be sought to authorise the taking of an intimate sample.<\/p><p> In general, the consequence of refusing to consent to the taking of an intimate sample is that an adverse inference may be drawn in subsequent proceedings.  This consequence does not arise in the case of protected persons or, for the most part, in the case of children.<\/p><p> The Bill contains safeguards around the DNA database itself.  The purposes of the database are set out clearly in the Bill in order to counter any possibility of &quot;function creep&quot;.  I am strongly in favour of this position.  The searches that may be conducted between different categories of profiles entered in the database are to be specified to ensure that a profile is only used for the purpose for which it was taken.<\/p><p> The management and operation of the database is to be subject to independent oversight by a statutory committee for the purpose of ensuring its integrity and security.  This committee is to be chaired by a judge or former judge of the Circuit Court or High Court and will include a representative of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The committee may also make recommendations to the director of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, or the Minister as regards the management and operation of the database.  The committee may, of its own volition, conduct reviews of any aspect of the management and operation of the database and the Minister can instruct it to review any matter relating to the database.<\/p><p> The committee's reports are to be submitted the Minister, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published, subject to certain restrictions in the interests of national security, the security of the database and criminal investigations and to avoid infringing the constitutional rights of any individual.  Disclosure of information relating to biological samples or information on the database is a criminal offence triable summarily or on indictment.<\/p><p> Regarding persons who are not proceeded against or convicted, the Bill includes a presumption in favour of the removal from the database of the DNA profiles of such persons subject to the Garda Commissioner having the power to authorise retention on the database where he or she is satisfied that this is necessary.  A statutory test is set out by which the Garda Commissioner will make this decision.  This decision can be appealed.  The retention periods allowed will be six years in the case of adults and three years in the case of children.  The DNA profiles of persons convicted of serious offences will continue to be held on the database indefinitely.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900041#PP00900","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381333800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  Legislation on the collection and management of DNA evidence is long overdue.  This is an example of our laws playing catch-up with modern medical science.  It has taken a while to get this right, but it seems that the Bill is a responsible balance between the use of modern science for the public good and maintaining the legal rights of the accused in criminal proceedings.<\/p><p>  The use of DNA evidence in our courtrooms is not new.  During the past two decades, some of the most high-profile cases involving the murders, and often rapes, of women were prosecuted using DNA evidence.  The cases of Rose Farrelly, Imelda Riney, Marilyn Rynne, Phyllis Murphy and Rachel Kiely all relied on the ability to use DNA evidence in court.  We must wonder how many unsolved cases could be solved and how many families of victims could be granted closure if Ireland kept a record of the DNA profiles of convicted criminals.  We regularly read of cases in the US and UK involving serious crimes that were solved many years later due to the matching of DNA from unrelated crimes.<\/p><p>  One story that has stayed in my mind is the tragic 1981 murder of the 14 year old schoolgirl Marion Crofts in Aldershot, England.  Her case was solved 21 years later as a result of a DNA swab taken at a police station from a man who had been arrested and charged with a domestic violence crime.<\/p><p>Without a DNA database, her family might still not know the identity of her killer.<\/p><p> We also have to wonder how many serious crimes might actually be prevented by this legislation.  If criminals were aware that their DNA was already on file from a prior crime, might that knowledge alone not be enough to prevent at least some of them from re-offending?  If even one murder was avoided owing to this legislation, it would have more than earned its place on our Statute Book.<\/p><p> There is no doubt in my mind that these proposed new laws could greatly assist garda&iacute; when tracing missing persons.  The legislation before us provides for family members of missing people to volunteer DNA for analysis to assist garda&iacute; in their tracing operations.  Volunteer evidence is not treated in the same manner as DNA samples taken from criminals and can be removed from the file on request by the donor.<\/p><p> This Bill is also an acknowledgement of the international nature of many crimes and the value of being able to share DNA records with police forces in other jurisdictions, for example, when dealing with suspects or victims who may have left the State or perhaps are living here after committing crimes in other countries.<\/p><p> I welcome the protections in the legislation that are given to suspects who are not charged with any crime or, indeed, to people who are found innocent of a crime.  In these cases, the DNA record can be removed from the database.  In this regard, it should also be noted that DNA databases have been used in other countries to prove the innocence of suspects and exonerate wrongly convicted persons.<\/p><p> The proposed legislation also recognises the efforts that are being made by the justice system to divert children and teens from crime.  In most cases, it provides for the removal of the child's evidence from the database after a period of four years if they have not re-offended.  I welcome this aspect of the legislation as it is in keeping with the aims of the early intervention and restorative justice programmes that are being discussed at present.<\/p><p> I support this Bill and look forward to examining it further on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900042#QQ00200","speaker":"1105","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381334400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  In general, everybody would welcome the introduction of this legislation and the establishment of a DNA database, which will assist in detecting and solving serious crimes.  The legislation has major benefits for solving crimes by identifying perpetrators.  That is vitally important when one sees serious crimes, particularly of a sexual nature, where DNA evidence could be critical in identifying those responsible.<\/p><p>  The legislation will have a deterrent effect on those at risk of committing crimes as they will be aware of the database's existence and the potential for samples to be taken from suspects and used in detecting crime.  The consequent likelihood of detection will have a certain deterrent effect.  A DNA database could also be important in proving the innocence of those who are wrongly convicted.  In other jurisdictions, there have been high-profile cases where the existence of a DNA database has allowed for the testing of suspects, thus identifying the perpetrators of various crimes.  In such cases, innocent people who were wrongly convicted have been exonerated.  That would be a welcome outcome of the database here.  <\/p><p>  The European Court of Human Rights has identified problems with the operation of DNA databases in other jurisdictions, however, so we need to take those matters into account.  Those problems cannot be understated and we should be aware of them.  The Minister has taken on board some of the concerns of civil rights groups as regards the potential misuse of a DNA database.  If DNA profiling is made available to other states for the detection of crimes in other jurisdictions, how will such profiles be treated in other countries and how can such data be protected?  We should at least demand that the same data protection provisions will apply as in this State so that DNA profiles cannot be wrongly used.  <\/p><p>  The legislation provides for a mass screening to be initiated but I can foresee problems arising as a result.  In order to initiate a mass screening, garda&iacute; should be obliged to obtain court approval.  That would be important in terms of oversight.  If such a mass screening is envisaged, garda&iacute; should present their reasons when applying for a court order to authorise that action.  That would give a measure of protection under the Bill. <\/p><p>  If a person who is asked to participate in a mass screening refuses to provide a DNA sample, how will that affect the presumption of innocence?  We should consider whether protections need to be put in place for such an eventuality.  In addition, those who are asked to participate in a mass screening should be afforded the opportunity to take legal advice.  They should be given enough time to seek such advice so that they can act in the full knowledge of what are their rights.<\/p><p>  The legislation provides that in mass screenings profiles will not be added to the database but, with the best will in the world, they could be added inadvertently.  Those kind of problems can arise, so people need to be aware of them.  Safeguards should be put in place to ensure that does not happen.<\/p><p>  Problems have arisen in other jurisdictions with what is termed &quot;function creep&quot; whereby databases can be used for other reasons, including the involvement of family members or relatives of the person who supplied the original DNA sample.  It cannot be presumed, nor should it, that the family or relatives of someone convicted of a crime, and who is on the database, would necessarily follow the criminal path.  In operating the legislation, we must take into account the issue of data protection for innocent people.<\/p><p>  The Bill will establish an oversight committee to review the operation of the database.  The committee will be required to report to the D&aacute;il annually on the operation of the legislation.  In the past, we have seen the problems encountered by the Garda Ombudsman in obtaining information and getting a response from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Such difficulties could potentially affect the oversight committee also.  We must ensure that the Bill, when enacted, is operated properly so that information is gathered and used as intended.  We should closely monitor the right to apply for an extension for the retention of profiles, over the six-year period, for people who have not been convicted of offences.<\/p><p>  The legislation is welcome and will play an important role in detecting crime and protecting citizens.  In addition, the existence of a database will act as a deterrent to crime.  Nonetheless, we will have to monitor closely the operation of the legislation following its enactment to ensure that it does what is intended.  The potential for misuse must be minimised within the legislation so we can have full confidence in the operation of a database and the system generally. <\/p><p>It should be under continual review by the Minister.  I acknowledge provision is made for a review by the oversight committee within six years of it coming into operation.  It is important it is closely monitored following enactment of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900043#RR00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381335000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Eamonn Maloney, Michael Conaghan and Se&aacute;n Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900044#SS00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1381335000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on the introduction of this Bill, which I support.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, referred to legislation of this nature in either his first or second speech following the election of this Government to office in March 2011.  As stated by previous speakers, it is complex legislation which seeks to address the need for a DNA system and the issue of civil liberties and so on.<\/p><p>  It could be argued that the introduction now of this legislation dealing with DNA is a bit late in the day.  Nevertheless, we are, as the saying goes, where we are.  The Americans established a DNA database in the 1990s.  People have differing views on the issue of DNA.  The following sums up the views of many people in regard to the introduction of this Bill.  In 1996, a young woman aged 21 years, named Juli Busken, was abducted from a parking lot in America, raped, murdered and dumped in a lake.  Seven years later, thanks to DNA, a man was arrested and subsequently found guilty of her murder.  Following the trial, her father said that for him there are only two types of people who do not want to have their DNA taken, namely, the person who has done something wrong and the person who intends to do something that is wrong, which sums how most lay people feel about DNA.  Many of us would share the common sense view that a DNA database should be available to police in all jurisdictions to assist them in the apprehension of people involved in serious crime.  As legislators, we must ensure those who enforce the law in Ireland are facilitated in every way.  This is being done through the introduction of this legislation.<\/p><p>  As I said earlier, a DNA database was established in the USA in the 1990s.  The UK DNA database was developed a little later.  Based on evidence of the UK system, there are substantial benefits in having a DNA database in place, in terms particularly of the investigation of serious crimes.  Such databases have proven very successful in relation to unsolved cases and missing persons.  It is hoped that this legislation when enacted will prove good for society but not for criminals.  I read the rape crisis network report this morning, which did not make for pleasant reading.  While much of the focus around DNA is on its use in murder cases, it is equally important in solving cases of a sexual nature, including rape and so on.  <\/p><p>  There is an obligation on us to introduce this type of legislation which will not only assist in solving crimes of a sexual nature but will, it is hoped, as in other jurisdictions, act as a deterrent to those who believe they can commit crimes and get away with them.  This is one of the sharpest instruments of law in terms of the prevention of crimes such as rape and murder.  I again commend the Minister and his Department on the introduction of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900044#SS00300","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1381335000,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  I would like first to focus on the value of forensic work in combatting crime.  In regard to local crime such as burglary, when word gets around in a local area that garda&iacute; are engaged in forensic work there is generally a fall off in this type of activity.  Burglars know that forensic evidence at the scene of local crimes may lead to a court case and conviction.  The fear of being caught and convicted is a real deterrent.  In this context, the use of forensics is a valuable tool.<\/p><p>  I would like now to speak about forensic work on a national level.  During the past 20 years, the context and character of crime in Ireland has changed fundamentally.  Gun use, pipe bombs and kidnappings were largely introduced and perfected by the IRA in Northern Ireland.  These practices have spilled over across the Border and are now, regrettably, common place here.   In this evolving and frightening scenario, all legitimate resources must be provided for the Garda.  It is in this context that I particularly welcome the Minister's initiative to establish a DNA database.  I believe it will prove invaluable in the fight against serious crime, particularly those categories of crimes that have evolved here over the past 15 to 20 years.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's guarantees in relation to the management, supervision and safeguarding of this proposed new resource.  I welcome also his guarantees in regard to the safeguarding of individual rights and dignity.  I wish the Minister well with this particular initiative.<\/p><p>With this and many other initiatives, he has proved himself an innovative Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900044#SS00400","speaker":"1031","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381335600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>It goes without saying that forensic science has transformed crime detection and investigation and enabled police forces to solve crimes that would have remained unsolved in earlier times.  We are all aware of forensic science through entertainment and the media, with a plethora of books, films and television programmes on the topic.  It is an area that has both influenced and been influenced by artistic content.  I recall reading a work which traced the link between the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes and the real life experience of the writer, Arthur Conan Doyle, with one of the earliest forensic scientists.  Such works entertained the public and inspired greater research and examination of forensic science.<\/p><p>  Another development which has greatly increased the effectiveness and usefulness of forensic science has been the substantial advances in information technology.  I am reminded of a particularly disturbing case in the United Kingdom which occurred when information technology and genetics-based forensic science were still very much in their infancy.  The case involved serial killer, Peter Sutcliffe, known as the Yorkshire Ripper, who was responsible for the murders of 13 women and the attempted murders of several others.  A 2006 report into the handling of the case detailed how the police had interviewed Sutcliffe on several occasions but released him, thereby enabling him to continue his heinous crimes.  The lack of an information technology system and absence of a forensic evidence database led to shocking oversights and the further loss of life.  Such cases demonstrate how crucial it is to have proper use of information technology and other scientific tools such as a DNA database to combat crime successfully.<\/p><p>  I welcome this Bill as a vital innovation which will help the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat crime.  I note it was first recommended by the Law Reform Commission a decade ago.  It is regrettable that such a lengthy period elapsed before the introduction of this legislation.<\/p><p>  I note also the ethical considerations at the heart of the Bill.  We pride ourselves in Ireland on a criminal legal system rooted in the presumption of innocence.  The collection and retention of DNA evidence during an investigation is understandable and reasonable.  However, it is the retention of such information in the event of an acquittal or a decision not to prosecute which has been the source of controversy.  There is a great need to strike the right balance between a person's individual rights to privacy and bodily integrity and the interests of wider society, which include ensuring the safety of citizens when detecting and preventing crime.<\/p><p>  Examining practice in other jurisdictions is always a useful exercise, and even more so when procedures have been in place for several years or decades, as this can bring to light problems, issues or mistakes.  One such issue is what is known as &quot;function creep&quot;.  The experience of the United States is a clear example of the original purpose of a DNA database extending far beyond what was envisaged, to the extent that samples are now taken and retained for the most minor of crimes.  Furthermore, individual US states are only obliged to destroy profiles of persons acquitted when such persons actually make an application for destruction.  I harbour concerns of such a practice emerging here.  A person, particularly one who has volunteered a sample, should not have to apply to have samples and profiles removed.  They should be destroyed automatically and without undue delay.<\/p><p>  The position in the United Kingdom should serve as a lesson for all legislators that personal rights must be balanced with the requirements of a functioning law enforcement agency.  The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 effectively removed the original safeguard that DNA samples and profiles be removed and destroyed following acquittal or where criminal charges have been dropped.  This clear abuse of power was only remedied when the parties concerned took legal action via the European Court of Human Rights.  We have had recent experience of the effect of decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights, of which every Deputy will be aware.  The court has been the subject of some very negative commentary, the majority of which has been uncalled for, and I am encouraged that, in drafting this legislation, the Minister has been mindful of the relevant decisions of the court and provisions of our Constitution, respectively.<\/p><p>  It is too easy in the intense heat of a moment, often in the aftermath of a particularly heinous crime, to rush through legislation which has not been afforded proper consideration and reflection.  While no legislation can be said to be watertight, I welcome the provisions of the Bill in introducing a statute only approach to the collection of samples.  This brings an end to common law practices and will, I am certain, provide a surer footing and promote standardised practices.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900045#TT00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1381335600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate on this very important legislation.  This is an important discussion because this is a complex Bill on which substantial work has been undertaken to ensure we provide an appropriate balance between assisting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the very important work it does by enabling the use of the best modern scientific techniques to identify the perpetrators of crime and address issues relating to missing persons, and protection for individual privacy and human rights.<\/p><p>  This is an area of law that should have been addressed many years ago.  Ireland is an outlier in Europe in not yet having a DNA database, and similar legislation is in place in at least 15 other European Union countries.  My officials will correct me if I am wrong but I understand a DNA database has been in place in the United Kingdom since 1995.  We have, therefore, taken a long time to reach this point.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the assistance of the Forensic Science Laboratory, has been using DNA in the context of identifying perpetrators of crime.  However, it is time to change our legislation and establish the database that is so badly required.  The restrictive nature of the current statutory framework, which limits the taking of samples for evidential purposes in connection with particular offences, does not facilitate the establishment of a DNA database as an intelligence resource for the Garda.  It is vital the Garda has such an intelligence resource.<\/p><p>  The databases in place in other European Union countries are used to store DNA profiles taken from known individuals and unknown DNA profiles developed from crime scene stains.  They facilitate speculative comparisons between different sets of profiles.  In this way, matches can be produced which generate investigative leads for the police.  This legislation provides for the establishment of such a quality intelligence tool for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As some speakers correctly noted, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has for some time sought the assistance of a DNA database in the work it does.<\/p><p>  I propose to address some specific issues of direct relevance to the legislation before the House, before discussing some of the comments made by Deputies.  I recognise and thank Deputy Niall Collins of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for his support for the legislation.  The Deputy asked about the provision of resources to the Forensic Science Laboratory, which is an issue I addressed in my earlier contribution.  I am keen to ensure the database will be ready for use as rapidly as possible after the legislation has been enacted.  Particular steps must be taken after enactment to bring the legislation into force.<\/p><p>  As I stated, the Forensic Science Laboratory has undertaken a substantial amount of preparatory work, including the installation last year of the purpose-built software on which the database will sit.  Known as CODIS, this software is used in more than 40 countries, including 18 EU member states.  The software installation allows for the storage of profiles in distinct files and has a rapid search capability.  It has also been configured to allow mutual searching of European databases, as required by the Pr&uuml;m Council decision to which I referred.<\/p><p>  It is to be expected that there will be a significant increase in the number of samples being submitted to the Forensic Science Laboratory after the legislation has been enacted.  The laboratory has been resourced to deal with this increase and is ready to accept increased demands on its services.<\/p><p>  Considerable investment in robotic instrumentation has also taken place to ensure the Forensic Science Laboratory is ready to deal with the demands the new database will bring.  All forensic samples are processed using robotic instruments, including for sample transfers.  This, in combination with a bar code system, acts to ensure the integrity of the sample throughout the process.<\/p><p>The investment in robotic equipment in advance of the database has enabled Forensic Science Ireland to validate its use and introduce it into its routine work.  This has already increased output in terms of case numbers and turnaround times.  Without being unduly critical, when my predecessor in the Department published a Bill in this area in 2010, the Forensic Science Laboratory had not been resourced, the necessary work had not been undertaken and the necessary equipment had not been put in place.<\/p><p> A sophisticated information management system, the installation of which is proceeding, will facilitate the tracking of all cases and samples from log in through examination to disposal and completion of the process.  It will underpin the recording of all processes in the laboratory and will also contain a record of all the personnel who interacted with the system at any stage of analysis and examination.  The general thrust of these new installations is to enable a high throughput of samples both from persons and from crime scenes with automated processes and tracking of these samples throughout the entire process from receipt to report.  At a time of financial restrictions across the board, as Minister, I have ensured the laboratory could continue to prepare for the enactment of this legislation as it goes through the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Deputy Collins also raised the issue of the Military Police.  As Minister for Defence, I am acutely aware of the work of the Military Police and the need to equip it with the resources it needs to do its work both here in Ireland and in troubled spots around the globe.  In the context of criminal matters, the Military Police will on occasion liaise with the Garda as the civil authority.  The Garda may have a role when particular incidents occur.  Department of Justice and Equality officials have met Department of Defence officials and members of the Defence Forces on this issue, including as recently as yesterday.<\/p><p> The Bill is directed at crime generally and at the population as a whole.  The Military Police is obviously involved in the detection and prosecution of crime in very limited circumstances - that is, when the suspect is a member of the Defence Forces.  This is an important issue and I have asked my officials in the Department of Defence to address this area in the context of defence matters.  I have had a conversation about whether during its passage through Parliament provisions in the Bill might be extended to the Military Police or if it would be beneficial to do so in a separate defence Bill.  That matter is under active consideration and as we head into Committee and Report Stages I will advise Members of the House on progress being made in those deliberations.  In addressing that issue it is important we do not delay the passage of the legislation before the House so that as soon as possible it is available to be of assistance to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the very important work they do.<\/p><p> Deputies Collins and Mac Lochlainn repeated the concerns of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties over the transmission of DNA information to other EU member states and to countries outside the EU.  Predictably Deputy Wallace raised his usual anti-United States phobias.  The Bill provides for the transmission of DNA information between EU member states to the extent required by the governing European Union decision and other international instruments.  It is beneficial that we so engage with our EU colleagues, with the United States and with other states.<\/p><p> I will give the blindingly obvious example of those who are sexual predators and prey on children - paedophiles - or those who have engaged in sexual offences and have targeted women in doing so.  There are no borders to prevent them travelling from one part of the world to another.  No borders prevent them from travelling across Europe.  No borders restrict, for example, someone who might commit a sexual offence in the United States also doing so as a visitor to this State.  There is an interest in ensuring we provide our citizens with the maximum protection.  There is an interest in ensuring the maximum co-operation between police forces.  Given that we will continue to have those who perpetrate crime on this island and elsewhere, it is in the interest of victims that the maximum scientific technical information is available to identify serial perpetrators of events.<\/p><p> That also applies to a number of other areas.  It applies to homicide and to other types of international crime.  It may well be that those engaged internationally in the drugs trade may leave a DNA sample on product that readily identifies someone who has imported into Ireland as a resident of the Netherlands or Spain.  We cannot have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fighting international crime with one hand tied behind its back and without the facility of using the most modern scientific techniques available to identify the perpetrators of crime.<\/p><p> In the context of EU law, we have no choice but to provide for the integration of our database.  The flip side of this is that the Garda will have access to databases throughout Europe and in any third countries with which we enter into arrangements.  The interrogation of databases is anonymous and where there is a hit, as I said in my opening remarks earlier today, any further activity on the case must take place under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  The transmission of DNA samples and profiles is already provided for in that Act and this Bill simply strengthens those provisions to ensure samples and profiles can only be transmitted to countries with safeguards equivalent to ours.  Deputies raised that issue, which is one of understandable genuine concern.  In dealing with this area, it is important not only to ensure the efficiency of policing and the maximum co-operation in the area of policing, but also that there are similar protections for people's privacy and human rights given that information that is held on database systems can be accessed internationally.<\/p><p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked about former offenders who qualified for release under the Good Friday Agreement.  The provisions on ex-offenders are quite circumscribed.  In particular, no former offender can be forced to provide a DNA sample.  A rigorous procedure covers the requesting of a sample.  Furthermore the circumstances in which the Garda may seek to have a sample taken are limited.  In addition, there is a ten-year watershed after expiry of a sentence after which a person cannot be requested to provide a sample.  All told, I believe these provisions are balanced, but I am prepared to consider any further submissions Deputy Mac Lochlainn may wish to make in this regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others asked why this Bill was not referred to the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The commission provided extensive comment on the 2010 Bill.  In its preparation, this Bill has taken account of the views expressed by the Irish Human Rights Commission on issues that arose under the 2010 Bill.  it is important that we do so.  The provisions I detailed earlier today, which are very different in this Bill with regard to the retention and destruction of samples, are examples of issues that would have been addressed by the Irish Human Rights Commission.<\/p><p> Deputy Halligan asked about the destruction of samples and removing profiles from databases.  Some other Deputies also adverted to that issue.  As Deputies Se&aacute;n Kyne, Finian McGrath and others noted, the legislation contains very extensive provisions addressing that area.<\/p><p>They are extensive and important in the context of human rights and privacy issues.  There is no question, as has been suggested by one Deputy, that under the Bill there is some presumption of guilt on the part of individuals.  The presumption of innocence is a central tenet of our legal system and it is not impacted by the legislation.  In any event, the legislation is of substantial importance and many Deputies acknowledged as much in their speeches.  In fairness, I acknowledge that Deputy Mac Lochlainn and Sinn F&eacute;in are supportive of the Bill.  Quite rightly, Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised issues as he is entitled to do.<\/p><p> I am keen to thank various Deputies although I realise now I am at risk of leaving someone out.  Even in the case of Deputies who spoke when I was not here, I am aware of their contributions.  I thank Deputies Peter Fitzpatrick, Paul Connaughton, Dara Murphy, Simon Harris, Seamus Healy, Ann Phelan, Anne Ferris, Se&aacute;n Kenny, Thomas Pringle, Eamonn Maloney, Michael Conaghan and Se&aacute;n Kyne for their supportive comments.  I hope I have addressed some of the issues that were raised during the course of their comments.<\/p><p> Deputy Dara Murphy made an important point that is worth coming back to and I will mention it briefly.  He noted that this is landmark legislation which will not only assist the Garda in the work that it does, but will provide the force with assistance for decades to come and that it is remarkably important legislation for victims of crime.  If a person is a victim of a serious crime, it can stay with him or her for many years and have a lasting impact on his or her capacity to enter into relationships; it can impact on his or her coping capacity or his or her sense of freedom to go about their daily lives unhindered.  For too many people there is a fear that they could become victims again.  For every victim of serious crime, one of the questions that remain with them is whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can bring to justice the perpetrator of the crime.  For many, it proves to be the case, but for others it does not prove to be the case.  Many are concerned in cases where they have been a victim that they may be revisited by the same criminal or that whatever they suffered may be inflicted on others.  This legislation will not only assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the work it does, but it will give many more victims of crime peace of mind in future because of the capacity it has in the establishment of the DNA database to assist the Garda to identify serial offenders with speed.<\/p><p> Some individuals can literally go on a crime binge and terrorise communities.  Recently, I was made aware of a case in a local community where they had suffered nine burglaries in the space of a few weeks.  The Garda was trying to identify the perpetrator.  Eventually, the perpetrator was caught exiting from a home that they visited a second time.  When the necessary work was done, it was established that the individual was the person responsible for the nine offences that occurred.  I have no wish to say anything more about it than that because I do not want to identify the location or the individual or do anything that could prejudice the prosecution.  However, if this individual was a previous offender, if the Garda had a DNA profile or database and if, when the first crime was committed, there was some DNA samples left - it might have been as simple as a hair follicle at the scene of the crime - then it may well have been that the identity of the perpetrator would have been known earlier and that the further crimes they committed could have been readily prevented.  That is a simple example of the benefits of this legislation to victims of crime and in crime prevention and that is why I maintain this is landmark legislation of great importance to the public and of great assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Again, it establishes us as having the same scientific systems as our EU counterparts and brings us to where we can connect with them in the context of the exchange of information.<\/p><p> I have been trying to resist the temptation to reference Deputy Wallace's extraordinary contribution on the Bill.  Deputy Wallace was the only Deputy who spoke who is opposed to the legislation.  It was not entirely clear exactly what he would do should there be a vote on it.  I have no idea when I sit down whether he will appear in the House to oppose it or whether he simply delivered a speech in opposition to it.  Anyway, I have noted with great interest Deputy Wallace's contributions on matters relating to assisting the Garda, protecting victims of crime, preventing crime and bringing offenders to justice.  I have compiled a list of the exotic contributions of Deputy Wallace in several debates in recent times.  If I were to sum up his very interesting perspective on the law, protecting our citizens and protecting people in the communities he represents in this House, it would be along the following lines.  First, the Garda should not have the facility of a DNA database.  That seems evident from his contribution.  Second, based on a contribution he made a week or ten days ago, no one should ever be fined by the courts for the various reasons he offered.  His view was that it does not matter what a person does and it does not matter how wealthy a person is, the courts should never impose a fine.  Further, no one should ever have a fixed ticket charge cancelled even when it is wrongly issued to the wrong person.  Fines are out but fixed ticket charges are compulsory even if a person receives such a charge and it turns out a mistake has been made about the registration number of the car.<\/p><p> The view that people are entitled to selectively break the law also seems to be a philosophy of Deputy Wallace in the context of various tranches of legislation enacted in the House.  Another principle that he adheres to with great consistency is that at every opportunity the integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be attacked and undermined.  He has another principle relating to certain countries, although in the case of one of the countries to which that principle applied it seems to have been changing its approach since the recent presidential election there.  The approach of Deputy Wallace with regard to the United States could be summed up by saying that America is the great Satan.<\/p><p> Finally, it seems to be his approach that DNA data should never be used to identify perpetrators of homicide, rapes or sexual offences or to establish the identity of an individual who has gone missing, nor should it ever be used to establish the innocence of an individual where there is an alleged miscarriage of justice.  That is an interesting and exotic perspective of what is in the interests of his constituents.  It is completely inconsistent with the views of every other Member with regard to the use of DNA and the importance of a DNA database.<\/p><p> I will conclude by saying something I said at the start of my speech, although I realise my officials occasionally find this embarrassing.  I thank the officials in the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General's office.  They have done an extraordinary job in producing comprehensive legislation which I have long sought to have enacted in the House.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, I have been so long in the House that I can remember persecuting a former Minister for Justice many years ago to enact the legislation we are repealing in this Bill.  There was a time when DNA databases did not exist but other neighbouring countries were using DNA in the investigation of crime when we were not and we lacked any facility to use it.  I am going back to a time when I would have piloted legislation into this House to provide for the use of the DNA to identify the parentage of children where there was a dispute about that.<\/p><p>It was a time when I was putting under pressure a former Minister for Justice to enact the legislation to which I referred earlier, which originally provided for the use of DNA in the fight against crime.<\/p><p> I thank Members for their supportive comments.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, it is a privilege to be in a position to be able to pilot this legislation through the House.  An enormous amount of work has been done on this Bill and I hope and believe that all the issues raised in respect of the 2010 Bill, some of which I raised myself as a criticism, have been addressed.  On Committee Stage, however, were Deputies to table constructive amendments to improve the Bill, I would be very happy to take them on board.  I already have mentioned that in dealing with one or two areas, including data protection, I intend to bring forward some amendments myself on Committee Stage.  I will conclude by commending the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900045#TT00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381337400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013: Referral to Select Committee","time":1381337400,"counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900048#WW00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1381337400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900048#WW00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381337400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381337400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 7.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Discretionary Medical Cards: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1381337700,"counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900049#XX00050"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381337700,"counter":503,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Billy Kelleher on Tuesday, 8 October 2013:  That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:\r\n\r\nnotes that:\r\n\r\n- the number of discretionary medical cards fell from 80,524 at the start of 2011 to 63,126 at the end of 2012;\r\n\r\n- in the first seven months of 2013 there was a further reduction of 8,142 such cards to 54,984, a monthly average reduction of 1,163;\r\n\r\n- the Health Service Executive (HSE) set a target for 2013 to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards;\r\n\r\n- this deliberate targeting was approved by the Minister for Health in the 2013 HSE Service Plan;

I want to highlight two cases as doing so makes the case for this motion better than any other way of dealing with matters.  The first case relates to a young man in his mid-30s who is married and has two children.  He is working.  He is on an interest only payment but is working with the bank to restructure his mortgage and, hopefully, he will get a split mortgage, but that issue is stressful for him.  Unfortunately, this young man has kidney disease and is avoiding dialysis by virtue of a concoction of medication that he is taking.  When I met him about 18 months ago regarding this issue he had been assisted by his family in meeting some of his bills, his mortgage and the cost of his medication but that could only continue for so long.  It was after he had run out of rope that he came to see me.  It may be easy to say that nobody pays more than &euro;144 per month for medication, but a problem arises, as in the case of this young man who is already financially stressed, if one has to pay that amount for medication every month, which would amount to almost &euro;2,000 a year after tax.<\/p><p>  It took that young man a long time to get a medical card.  We made many arguments to support his application, there were exchanges back and forth and it took him the best part of a year to get it.  It was granted with an expiry date of 28 February 2014.  He has since been written to and advised that the expiry date has been brought forward to 30 November this year.  Taking account of that date, he will have got it for fewer than nine months.  <\/p><p>  He is not looking for a medical card for the rest of his family.  He has very specific needs and only wants it for himself to cover the cost of his medication.  He needs his prescription.  When I met him he had not got his prescription filled for two months and was very unwell.  I questioned in whose interest was it that he would not get a medical card.  If he stops taking his medication he will almost inevitably end up on dialysis.  That will cost him his job and it will cost the State to maintain him on a very expensive system that is less than ideal.  He is now paying part of his mortgage and his family are managing.  I do not see the logic if it was decided not to renew his medical card.  Dealing with his case in that way would be a silo-based approach.  When he has to renew his request for a medical card it will cost him money to get medical evidence because invariably consultants will charge and I am aware of instances of that.  Therefore, not renewing his card does not make economic sense or medical sense.  Furthermore, it is inhumane.<\/p><p>  It states on the website that medical card applications take 15 days to process but routinely the processing of an application takes six weeks.  When a person is making the case for a medical card on medical grounds, the person's financial position is considered first and it is only at that point that medical grounds are considered.  Given that it is taking six weeks to deal with an application, the manner in which that process happens needs to be examined.  If a person is making an argument on medical grounds, the person is not making the argument that he or she fits in with the guidelines.<\/p><p>  We all have lists of cases and the second one I wish to highlight is the case of one of my constituents.  He is 69 years of age and has had a medical card for the past 13 years.  His condition is deteriorating.  He needs to see his cardiologist and he suffers from numerous conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and dementia and he wears a pacemaker.  He was on 13 tablets a day but has now stopped taking his medication.   <\/p><p>  The two cases that I referenced highlight the circumstances of two human beings.  There is something wrong here.  It is not in the State's interest to have a medical system when the medical card system is failing people who need a medical card and where it makes complete sense for them to have one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900049#XX00700","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1381337700,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on the medical card issue.

We cannot have a situation where seriously ill patients are denied a medical card.  It is difficult and tough enough for sick people to cope with their illness while at the same time have to fight, scrap and scrape for a medical card.  It is wrong.  It is inhumane and above all it is a gross attack on vulnerable people.  It also shows the kind of society that some people want in this country.<\/p><p>  I got elected three times to the D&aacute;il on a strong health and disability platform and in this debate I am standing by that commitment.  Health, disability and education are very important issues to me.  I will always fight for a quality health and disability service.  In any society these matters have got to be top of the political agenda and, as we all know, they are a matter of life and death.<\/p><p>  Focusing on the details, the number of discretionary medical cards fell from 80,524 at the start of 2011 to 63,126 at the end of 2012.  In the first seven months of 2013 there was a further reduction of 8,142 such cards to 54,984, a monthly average reduction of 1,163.  The HSE set a target for 2013 to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards and this deliberate targeting was approved by the Minister for Health in the 2013 HSE service plan.  The targeted reduction of 55,328 in 2013 has been exceeded.  <\/p><p>  I deplore the decision to deliberately target people in clinical need of such cards.  I call on the Government to discontinue the targeting of those with discretionary medical cards and to ensure that no one in clinical need would be denied such cards where it can cause significant financial distress. <\/p><p>  I attended a launch by Down Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland and Irish Autism Action today who were campaigning for people with disabilities.  Some 763 children are waiting six months or more for an assessment of need under the Disability Act.  Some &euro;325 was cut to the annual respite care grant in 2012.  The annual reduction in disability allowance since 2008 is &euro;847.  There are 1,900 children awaiting assessment by a primary care occupational therapist and 34,617 people are awaiting speech and language therapy.  This is the reality of what is happening under this Government.  I challenge the Minister of State and all the Members present in this regard; the reality is that we need to support people who are sick and people with a disability.  St Michael's House and Prosper Fingal are crying out for support.  I urge the Minister of State to adopt a common sense approach tonight.  I urge all my colleagues in this Chamber to support the motion at 9 p.m. and to support in particular those seriously ill people who are looking for a medical card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900049#XX01000","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1381337700,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I welcome and support this Private Members' motion.  Hopefully, it will refocus and allow for a re-examination of the inhumane and harsh adjudication on patients who formally would have been granted discretionary medical cards on compassionate grounds but who now are being turned away.<\/p><p>As indicated during this debate, there is anecdotal evidence in abundance to suggest that discretionary medical cards are more difficult - if not almost impossible - to obtain.  The move to deprive non-terminal cancer sufferers of such cards is imposing further terrible anguish and stress on these individuals.  Such people must deal with the psychological impact of losing their medical cards in addition to trying to cope with their ongoing conditions.<\/p><p> In the past, people with long-term or lifelong illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, cerebral palsy and cancer were granted discretionary medical cards on compassionate grounds in circumstances in which there was undue hardship.  Now, however, those who suffer with such conditions are asked about their incomes and means and receive repeated requests for further information.  The application process is long and drawn out.  Reviews are carried out and people may eventually be obliged to lodge appeals on the basis that they have rapidly progressive illnesses which may eventually prove terminal.  The latter is not taken into account during the process.  Taking away discretionary medical cards is not cost-effective because it means that fewer patients can be cared for in their homes and communities and that they eventually end up in hospital.<\/p><p> I recently dealt with a couple of cases involving people who have extremely serious health conditions.  The first involves two elderly cancer patients who are married, who are old age pensioners and who have limited incomes.  The wife will travel from Dingle to Cork University Hospital tomorrow for a mammogram.  It will be a round trip of 250 miles.  The woman is continually monitored by her GP, in various hospitals, etc.  The couple in question are only just above the income limit.  The husband is due to undergo treatment for prostate cancer.  The second case to which I refer relates to three children from a middle-income family who all have cystic fibrosis.  One of them has been chosen to take part in drug trials and will be obliged to make a round trip of 130 miles in order to attend for these in Cork University Hospital.  I ask the Minister of State to take note of serious cases of this nature.  I could provide him with details of several more if I had time to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900049#XX01100","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381338300,"counter":514,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Jerry Buttimer, who is sharing time with Deputies Maloney, Ann Phelan, Regina Doherty, Nash and Connaughton.

As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I am aware, as the Minister indicated, that there is an issue with regard to how the HSE communicates with people in writing and how it determines eligibility.<\/p><p>  It is a pity Deputy Finian McGrath has left.  Anyone can shout, roar and play to the gallery.  However, what I want to do is to put some figures on the record.  Deputy Finian McGrath referred to how a society values its people.  Let us use that as the measure in the first instance.  Forty percent of citizens have access to medical cards and a further 2.7% have GP-only cards.  In addition, the Government will spend between &euro;13.2 billion and &euro;13.5 billion on health this year.  That is a measure of how we value our people.  It also attests to the reform of the health system in which the Government is engaged.  I welcome the statements from both the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, that those with discretionary medical cards are not being targeted.<\/p><p>  The motion before the House is the classic old-style Punch-and-Judy approach of Fianna F&aacute;il.  When the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin, served as Minister for Health and Children there were overruns in the health budget, but not a word has been said about that by the members of his party.  Where are Fianna F&aacute;il's suggestions with regard to how we might make health care more accessible and available to the population?  The motion contains is a litany of figures but no solution.  Never before in the history of the State have so many people had medical cards or GP-only cards.<\/p><p>  On foot of the motion before the House and discussions that have taken place at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we must challenge the HSE to indicate the basis on which people can qualify for medical cards and how they might apply for them.  At one of the meetings of the joint committee, I made the point to the Minister of State that people are petrified when they receive letters indicating that their cases are being reviewed.  Very often there is nothing to worry about; these are merely reviews.  As a result of what was said at the meeting to which I refer, the HSE changed the language used in the letters it sends people.  I take this opportunity to compliment the staff of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, for being prepared to be available to and engage with people.  We must remove fear from the equation.  I welcome the decision taken by the Minister and the Minister of State to establish the clinical review panel.<\/p><p>  The State has a duty and a responsibility to provide people with access to health care, which it is doing.  Those who are vulnerable need to continue to have access to health care.  That is the test we must pass.  If we fail in this regard, we will undermine the process of reform in which the Minister and the Minister of State have engaged by creating the hospital groups, restructuring the HSE, reconfiguring the health service, reducing the cost of pharmaceutical products, promoting the use of generic medicines and improving work practices in hospitals.  All of these developments have occurred on foot of the Minister's reform agenda and the level of buy-in from health care staff.<\/p><p>  The staff of the PCRS can only do so much.  The management of the HSE must invest time and energy in communicating properly with medical card holders, with the Joint Committee on Health and Children and with Members of this House.  The centralisation of the HSE medical card system was a welcome development.  People might ask why that was the case.  I am of the view that it exposed the nod-and-wink culture which obtained under Fianna F&aacute;il whereby people whose incomes massively exceeded the thresholds were given medical cards to which they were not entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900050#YY00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1381338300,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900050#YY00400","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1381338300,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Those to whom I refer received a clap on the back and voted for Billy, Se&aacute;n, Mick, Batt or whomever was running for election at the time.

I wish to preface my remarks by observing that just because people sit on the Opposition benches does not mean they have a monopoly on concern.  I am equally concerned about the people I represent in my constituency.  Just because those to whom I refer are sitting on the benches opposite does not mean everything they do is good.  I am of the view that this matter is so important that people should not try to score political points in respect of it.  We are discussing people's health and I do not like individuals to play politics with that issue.  I thank the Minister for acknowledging the fact that people are not being deliberately targeted.  This matter is being spun in such a way as to make it appear that we are deliberately trying to take away people's medical cards.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<\/p><p>  I admit that some people are falling through the cracks.  There is no doubt about that.  However, the majority of those with whom I deal have their medical cards returned if they supply the information requested by the PCRS.  I also admit that work must be done in respect of certain individuals who find themselves in extreme ill health.  I communicated this fact to the Minister and he has replied that he is intent on resolving the matter.<\/p><p>  There are some facts that cannot be ignored.  The population of this country is a mere 4.5 million.<\/p><p>Some 1.8 million people are now in receipt of medical cards.  That is a fact no matter what way one does the sums and it is an astounding figure.  Medical cards are not free and a certain amount of money has to be paid to GPs for servicing them.  People tend to ignore facts but I tend not to do so.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Buttimer who said that the PCRS ensures all applications are assessed in a fair, equitable and transparent manner and that it is not under political patronage.  I welcome the fact it does not involve what he described as the nod and the wink of perhaps a Fianna F&aacute;il person.  It did not matter how sick one was or what one's income was but who one voted for was what mattered, which was a disgrace.<\/p><p> All applications are assessed in adherence with the HSE national assessment guidelines which ensure the &euro;2 billion spent annually on the medical card system is as cost-effective as possible.  I do not believe anyone would argue with that.  It must be cost-effective in that we must know we are getting value for money.  There have been significant improvements in the system in terms of efficiency and overall delivery of service, in particular in respect of the delivery of service on an emergency basis and on discretionary grounds where undue financial hardship is involved.<\/p><p> There are still some people who fall through the cracks, which I admitted earlier.  Currently, the system dictates that where an individual and-or his or her family is experiencing undue financial hardship as a result of an ongoing medical condition, he or she may qualify for a medical card on a discretionary basis.  While this is commendable, we could go one step further.  Why should financial hardship take precedence when assessing an individual for a discretionary card?  Personal hardship should also be taken into account as it certainly applies in some circumstances.  We all have examples of such people.<\/p><p> I do not envy the Minister of State.  This situation is not of his making.  We inherited a very difficult situation.  As a result of the economic situation, people are coming into the medical card system all the time.  There is a cost to that, which must be met.  Perhaps we could do some re-balancing of the medical card system in respect of young healthy individuals aged between 18 and 25 years of age who become unemployed but who never need to go to the doctor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900050#YY00600","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381338900,"counter":520,"content":"<p>The Government's overarching goal is to ensure medical cards are issued to people who need them most.

The cards are issued to people with serious illnesses, regardless of their incomes.  Panels of doctors are now assessing applications for discretionary cards as opposed to the wink and the nod culture, to which Deputy Ann Phelan referred.<\/p><p>  This motion is a complete puff of smoke by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It talks about the reduction of discretionary medical cards from 80,000 to 63,000 last year and a further 8,000 this year but what it fails to recognise is that of the 24,000 discretionary medical cards issued in that time, 23,000 of those people now have a medical card because of their entitlement and not because of the wink and nod culture where a Fianna F&aacute;il person telephoned the PCRS or the former health boards instructing them to give the card.  This Government is acting with probity.<\/p><p>  It is no surprise that we have seen a reduction in the number of medical cards in recent months - probably more so than in previous months - and the return of medical cards to which people were not entitled.  The money we are spending on our health service needs to be directed to the people who most need it.  Those people who have incomes in excess of the threshold are not entitled to get medical cards.<\/p><p>  The State cannot afford to pay for a medical card for everybody, regardless of means.  Currently, almost half the population has access to free medical care funded by the State.  According to HSE figures, in excess of 2 million people, or 45% of the population, have a means-tested medical card or GP visit medical card.<\/p><p>  This Government's aim, which it will probably not achieve in its lifetime but please God it will do so in the future, is to give everybody access to universal health insurance, so there will be a one-tier medical service and not the current three-tier service or the two-tier service promulgated by the previous Government.<\/p><p>  Medical services need to be delivered on the basis of the people's means, so that the money being spent by taxpayers follows the patient and their needs and not the way it was done in the past with a wink and a nod.  This motion is a puff of smoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1381338900,"counter":521,"content":"<p>The awarding of medical cards on discretionary grounds is a fraught issue and is probably one of the most familiar to Members of all political persuasions.  We have all been asked at one stage or another by our constituents to make representations on their behalf.  In an ideal world, I would like to see a system of universal health care where all citizens have free and ready access to primary health care provision, a system which would be self-sustaining in the long run by avoiding later more serious or prolonged medical intervention for conditions which could have been treated simply and cheaply with early action.  We are making some inroads in that regard.  Unfortunately, we do not live in such an ideal world currently and we must try to make do with the limited resources we have available to us in a fair and equitable manner.  Even under such constrained circumstances, it is important to remember that almost half our population has access to a medical card.<\/p><p>  In general, the system of issuing cards based on an individual's financial circumstances is very clear and quite well understood.  The problems arise where people do not meet the income criteria but may have large medical bills due to long-term illnesses or disabilities.  There are groups of people with conditions who may rarely need to see a doctor but who would need the security of ready access should it be needed.  One group is children with congenital heart defects, some of whom may not need regular visits to a GP but obviously would need ready access should it be needed.  It is my belief and that of most Members that parents of such children should not have to worry about finding the money to visit the doctor nor should the parents of children with Down's syndrome have to share that burden.<\/p><p>  Other groups which should not be refused medical cards include patients undergoing oncology treatment.  Surely the non-renewal of cards for such people can only add to stress and lessen their chances of a full recovery.  We are all aware of certain examples where the system does not necessarily work to their benefit.<\/p><p>  Having said all of that, I know the Minister of State is aware of these problems and I commend him and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, for directing the HSE to set up a clinical process to assist in the processing of such applications.  However, it is important when dealing with such cases that not only is the system fair but that it is seen to be fair.  In cases where a refusal to grant a discretionary medical card on medical grounds is being reviewed or appealed, the HSE issues a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; decision at the end of its deliberations.  This is fine where a review or an appeal has been successful but it is, as the Minister of State knows, deeply frustrating in unsuccessful cases where people are sometimes left in the dark, to a degree, about the basis for that decision.  As I have mentioned previously to the Minister of State, it is not unreasonable for the HSE to provide even a basic summary of its findings and the rationale behind why certain decisions are not in somebody's favour.  The HSE will only provide these reasons on foot of a freedom of information request which can be very time-consuming and frustrating.<\/p><p>  As I said, I raised this with the Minister of State last week and in fairness to him, he has agreed to take a look at that particular process.  I take the opportunity to urge him to continue in that vein and to ensure we have an even fairer and more transparent system.<\/p><p>As I said previously, I cannot see how any costs would be incurred by such a change.  If anything, savings could well result from it.  Such transparency would also bring more consistency to decisions made in relation to medical cards issued on a discretionary basis.  The perceived and sometimes real lack of consistency can sometimes be a bit of a bugbear for people.<\/p><p> It was mentioned earlier that 1.8 million citizens have full access to medical cards.  That is not an insignificant number.  There is clear evidence that approximately half of the population benefits from medical cards.  Given that so many demands are being placed on the system, there is no doubt that there can be problems in getting decisions right all of the time.  As public representatives, we often hear about some of the challenges people encounter in their dealings with the medical card system.  While I acknowledge that there can be problems with the administration of the system, I think it is improving and changing.  We should not be blind to the improvements that are being made to a system that was not renowned for the transparency of its decision-making process.  Some of the interventions made by this Government, the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State in the Department of Health to ensure there is greater openness and transparency in this area are to be commended.  Much more can be done to make sure we are all satisfied that the situation is much clearer and much more transparent for all citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381339500,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have an opportunity to speak on Private Members' business.  Many people are affected by this issue.  We all have our own stories in this regard.  It is important to acknowledge the motion we are discussing.  No attempt has been made to remove mass amounts of medical cards.  The problem lies with the changes that have been made in the process.  I will talk about the small number of people who have been affected by these changes, which have had a significant effect on their lives.  That is where the problem is coming from.<\/p><p>  Like many other Deputies, on a daily or weekly basis I meet constituents who are affected by the reduction in the number of discretionary medical cards.  I have identified three problems with the manner in which this reduction has been implemented.  I refer to the timing of the decrease, the manner in which it was communicated or not communicated to people and the dire position many acutely ill people are now in.  We are all aware of the pressure the HSE is under as it tries to find savings and help enable this country to balance its books.  I appreciate the major part the health budget plays in the context of overall expenditure.  Therefore, it is clear that when Government budgets are cut, there must be commensurate reductions in the health budget.<\/p><p>  When savings are made, it is important that the manner of the cuts does not add to the difficulty being experienced by people.  We believe this was the case recently when the number of discretionary medical cards was reduced.  I am aware that people who were granted discretionary medical cards in the spring had them removed just three months later, necessitating their re-entry into the application and appeals process.  Surely this is a gross waste of resources within the medical cards office and the HSE appeals office.  I suggest that the reduction in the number of medical cards should be effected gradually as they fall due, rather than in one fell swoop as appears to have been the case.<\/p><p>  The lack of communication in relation to what has been happening has caused great confusion for the public.  People deserve to know what is happening.  The HSE communications office is well able to publicise good news, so it is only right that the withdrawal of medical cards from the population should be explained in a similarly forthright fashion.  The staff in that office should have been obliged to share this information with the general public.  Instead, very ill people had their lives thrown into turmoil when a letter arrived stating that their medical cards had been cancelled but failing to provide a reason or context for that decision.<\/p><p>  Communication continues to be a problem, especially when it comes to the allocation of medical cards to the chronically ill.  Three examples come easily to mind.  A lady who was paralysed in an accident last year was granted a medical card in early 2013 following a mammoth battle.  She had been rendered tetraplegic after the accident and required extensive rehabilitation in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  She was informed in July of this year that the medical card was cancelled.  An application to have the card reinstated was turned down.  The matter is now under appeal.  In the meantime, she has been left without a card.<\/p><p>  The second case I would like to mention is quite similar.  It relates to a man who suffered an accident over 30 years ago which left him paralysed and in a wheelchair.  He has always held a medical card.  He was informed in July without warning that his card was cancelled.  He faces the prospect of cutting back on the number of colostomy tubes and bags he uses because the cost of those items is prohibitive in the absence of a medical card.  There is no doubt that this will increase the likelihood of infection.  This man may well have to present himself to his local accident and emergency department before the winter is out.  To add to his difficulties, he has developed high blood pressure since his card was withdrawn.  His family believes this is due in no small part to his worries about the medical bills that may accrue if he is hospitalised.  To add insult to injury, the last time he was granted a medical card - on discretionary grounds due to his disability - his wife received a GP visit card.  They took the time to ring the medical card office to say she did not need the GP visit card, and had not sought it, but they were told it had been granted and they should keep it.<\/p><p>  The third case to which I would like to refer is just as surreal.  It relates to a man who is on the transplant list as he awaits a kidney transplant and attends dialysis three days a week.  Now that he does not have a medical card, the cost burden on his family is proving great.  Surely it does not take weeks for a medical assessor to determine that someone on the transplant list has exceptional medical needs.  In addition to his health concerns, the man is now worried that if his transplant operation comes through, he will be faced with astronomical medical bills.  Why did the HSE once again use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?  Is there absolutely no common sense in the allocation of medical cards?  Surely someone on the transplant list is defined as having an exceptional medical need.  Can a programme not be put in place whereby the medical card office can refer to the current transplant list so that these ill people can be spared the stress of waiting for weeks to see whether their applications are successful?  Details of all these cases have been provided to the Minister.  I have already been in contact with the medical card office in relation to all three cases.<\/p><p>  It is quite obvious to me that there are problems in the assessment of medical evidence.  Surely it is not impossible for the primary care reimbursement office to provide guidelines to people on what can be said to constitute &quot;exceptional medical circumstances&quot; which warrant a discretionary medical card.  Equally, people should be given guidance on how best to prove their medical evidence.  I understand that the HSE service plan for this year included a plan to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards from 63,000 to 55,000 and replace them with the full medical card.  I believe the manner in which this has been conducted is nothing short of a disgrace, especially given that the people worst affected are those with the greatest medical needs.  I accept that a small number of people in possession of discretionary medical cards might not have merited them.  The manner in which the HSE has handled this has ensured the greatest burden and stress has been placed on those most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900052#AAA00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1381339500,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Michael Moynihan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900052#AAA00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1381339500,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am glad I made it back to the Chamber in time for this debate.  I was on the run.  Deputy Kelleher has made it clear that the number of discretionary medical cards decreased by approximately 17,000 in the 12-month period from the start of 2011 to the start of 2012.  He has accepted that discretionary medical cards are for sick people with serious illnesses.  As the Minister knows, those who have to deal with serious illness can face major financial hardship.  All Deputies are aware of what is happening as people lose their medical cards.  This issue has been raised in many parliamentary questions and on Topical Issues.<\/p><p>  One of the points that has been made about discretionary medical cards is that it used to be possible for one to be granted such a card in respect of a serious illness for a temporary period until one recovered.  This does not seem to be happening at the moment.  Indeed, the former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, has suggested that health cutbacks are being implemented by applying &quot;the letter of the law&quot; and discarding the element of discretion that formerly existed.  She gave the example of people with motor neurone disease who are now finding it hard to qualify for medical cards.  The chief executive officer of the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association has said that she has tried many avenues in her search for answers in this regard, but she has failed to get any.  I am sure the newly appointed Ombudsman will encounter the same issue when the issue of medical card applications is raised with him.<\/p><p>  The Jack and Jill Foundation has warned that the cutbacks being imposed are making it increasingly difficult for seriously ill people to access discretionary medical cards.  The Irish Medical Organisation has reported that the HSE has unilaterally cancelled certain medical cards without advising patients.  I agree with the organisation that patients should not have to find out from their general practitioners that their entitlements have been withdrawn.  I think that is an appalling situation.  We have been told that the HSE is considering a three-year period of eligibility rather than a one-year period.  This is also very worrying.  It is obvious that from an administration point of view, people have to gather a huge amount of information every year to reapply for a medical card.<\/p><p>  Like other Deputies, I can give many examples of cases that highlight the sort of issues that are arising for our constituents.  I have been told by a man who has cancer and is undergoing two types of chemotherapy and radiation that it took more than six months for his application to be approved.  He sent in various medical reports from his doctors.  He was initially refused because his means exceeded the limit.  He was not granted the card until his sick pay from his employment ceased and his only income was illness benefit.<\/p><p>As the card was issued for six months, from June to November 2013, he is due for review again next month.  This is a very difficult situation for a man who is still on treatment.  Another constituent who has multiple sclerosis had a medical card valid up to 2015.  He was reviewed under the 2013 guidelines and issued with a GP visit card.  After further medical evidence was submitted by the general practitioner, he received a full medical card.  In another case, a person in receipt of a social welfare payment plus an income of &euro;600 per year from land was issued with a GP visit only on review.  He appealed the decision and received a full medical card.  A huge number of appeals are being dealt with.  A person with diabetes and high blood pressure was told he had been refused a GP visit card because his means exceeded the limit by less than &euro;5.  On appeal, this man, who is almost 70 years of age, was granted a full medical card.  There is great anxiety, concern and grief throughout the country at what is happening.  As one who is interested in this area, I hope the Minister of State will ensure nobody in clinical need is denied a medical card where there is significant financial distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900052#AAA00500","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381340100,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Billy Kelleher on tabling the motion.

We did not get that particular issue solved.<\/p><p>  I was struck today by the press release issued by an extraordinary individual who is known to all of us in the House, Mr. Jonathan Irwin, who, at more than 70 years of age and not in the best of health, has devoted his life, and continues to do so, to working for children who are severely medically challenged.  He referred to the Taoiseach's comments in the House today by stating:<blockquote>The heartless letters being sent out to the families of children with severe disabilities as a result of brain damage, precious children under our wing, are an absolute disgrace.  The Taoiseach must challenge the HSE and call a halt to this system which is torturing already stressed parents.  Remember these are parents who simply want to care for their sick child at home, which makes sense medically, financially and morally.  The HSE should be embracing these parents and supporting them to look after their child.<br \/><br \/>Instead, parents are receiving cold letters from the HSE in relation to applications for medical card-GP visit card; letters that make no mention of the child, and boldly state that &quot;Your application will be considered closed unless information is received to support your application within 21 days from the date of this letter.<\/blockquote>He went on to state:<blockquote>My call to the Taoiseach today is simple.  Please do the right thing on behalf of these sick children and their parents.  Do what the UN Convention on the Rights of Children recommends in relation to sick children and their entitlement to medical cards.  Fix this broken system so that Ireland's children in most need are granted their medical card in their own right.  If you cannot do that immediately, fast track their applications in the meantime.  This issue needs the immediate clout and the commitment from the Taoiseach to address it head on and I believe that Enda Kenny is the man to make this happen.<\/blockquote>I do not know whether the Taoiseach will get directly involved.  The Minister of State is the man who is charged with solving it.  I do not believe the Minister of State would stand over the disgraceful treatment of many people with serious illnesses.  This is what we are talking about.  It is not a puff of smoke and I ask the Minister of State to take immediate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900053#BBB00800","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1381340100,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the motion and also on the Government's amendment.  We are asked to note that there has been no change to the manner in which discretionary medical cards are awarded.  That does not stand up.  I have cases in my constituency of people with very severe disabilities who have had medical cards for many years and who suddenly find they have been withdrawn.  I had one extreme case - I do not wish to go into the details because it might identify the person - where I was utterly shocked that the medical card had been withdrawn.  A colleague of mine from the Minister of State's party in my constituency and I worked on this issue.  When we became aware of the circumstances of the case we contacted the medical card section and were advised to appeal.  This has been going on for many months and no card has been granted.<\/p><p>  If the Minister of State is interested in the case, I will provide, on a confidential basis, the circumstances of the case and he can check out what I have said.  If anything, he will find that I am understating the position.  I can understand on a review how a mistake might be made.  However, I cannot understand, given that the evidence we have provided was so thorough and overwhelming, the reason, months later, the card still has not been granted.  I checked today with my assistant in the office if it was her impression and clear understanding that cards are being withdrawn where they had been granted in the past on medical need.  She said that is what is happening.<\/p><p>  It is correct in some cases when one makes the case and goes through the process that one wins the appeal.  This is happening in many cases but it is putting a huge strain on people to get evidence that is already available to the HSE.<\/p><p>It seems to be a pattern with this Government so there is no point in blaming the HSE for this.  The Minister of State's party colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, is constantly throwing people off invalidity pension who have been on it for years.  Where we produce all the medical evidence and go to appeal, in the vast majority of cases and after a slow process - the process is slow rather than there being a lack of evidence - the person then wins the appeal and gets the invalidity pension back.  There seems to be a process of believing that people who have been given either an invalidity pension or a medical card based on medical need for a long time no longer need them.  It seems to be hitting people who often find it quite difficult to get the evidence together - not because it is unavailable but because it means going to doctors and getting a lot of paperwork together.  Due to their disability, these people can find difficult what we do as our daily work.  This puts a lot of pressure, including mental pressure, on them.  <\/p><p> I do not understand the logic behind this approach.  If one takes all the people off invalidity pension and puts them on jobseeker's allowance, the saving is minimal.  In a very competitive work market, the chances of those people getting employment if they have been on invalidity pension for 15 years are next to nothing when we already have a market that is overcrowded.  What seems to be happening with the medical card is not just an isolated &quot;one issue&quot; matter but a pattern that is being followed by the Government and Labour Ministers to try to make savings.  It is not a fair way of doing it.  <\/p><p> There are rumours circulating that the Minister of State will give every child in the country under five a medical card, which is very attractive.  It does mean that parents earning &euro;200,000 per year will be granted medical cards and at the same time, there is a vendetta against those who most need them based on medical grounds.  This is a very serious issue.  It is a matter of hitting the weak and vulnerable and putting huge strain on people because it is creating uncertainty about the future.  I accept that the previous Government made a mistake when we granted medical cards to everyone over 70 because of the cost factor.  However, it was right of us to say that once a person reached 70 and received a medical card, there should be no further review of the card.  There is an argument that in straitened times, one cannot give cards to people of very great means - unless one is to give cards to everybody in the country - and have families struggling on low means and no card.  I have always been of the view that somewhere in the higher echelons, there is an argument for saying that the universal provision of anything like a medical card must be at the expense of somebody else because there is only a finite amount of money and it inevitably is at the expense of struggling families who are earning a bit of money and are just over the threshold.  <\/p><p> Where somebody with a significant disability is given a card and their income is very unlikely to change significantly if they are a pensioner, it should be left and not reviewed.  Before the general provision of medical cards for older people was introduced, the problem was not with taking the card from them, rather, it was the review and the strain, stress and worry the person suffered in trying to get the bits of paper together to deal with the review and in wondering whether they would get the card back.  Even when somebody like myself would have said on looking at their circumstances that they would inevitably get it back and that there was no need to worry that did not take away the worry.  <\/p><p> There needs to be a change of attitude.  We need to go back to the much more humanitarian processes that were in place in the past where we dealt with real people who had a good idea about the people to whom the cards were granted rather than these so-called fair procedures that are so far removed and that try to judge everything on a bit of paper without ever having met the person about whom a judgment is being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900053#BBB00900","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381340700,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion.  I have had considerable amount of experience over the past 12 months, particularly this year, in dealing with discretionary medical cards.  In one case, I set about getting a medical card for a person who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and who needed immediate hospital care.  Documentation came back to us about a small private pension of some &euro;67 per month.  As we were working through it, the cancer was found to be more serious than had been anticipated and the person died without the medical card being approved, even with a letter from the consultant stating that the cancer was terminal.  I got on the telephone over several days to explain how serious the case was to the medical cards section and yet we still received what I can only describe as tripe from the section.  I remember when another e-mail came back looking for some form of clarification.  At that stage I knew how serous the situation was for the family.  I had to go look again at the process and ask relatives to go through paperwork to find what the medical cards section was looking for.<\/p><p>  The simple notion that there is no change in policy is irrelevant.  I do not think there is a Deputy, Senator or public representative in any part of this country who would not accept privately, although maybe not publicly, that there is a change in direction in respect of the medical card.  We have seen people, particularly children with special needs.  I have met an adults their thirties with special needs.  There is always concern on the part of parents about long-term care.  The medical cards section questions a woman who may never have had earned income for herself and checks the income of retired parents.<\/p><p>  There is a change in policy in this area.  The basic human effort from the medical cards section must relate to where there is overriding medical need.  I am talking about the cancer patient, not about somebody who is way over the limit financially.  I am also talking about retired people of modest means who have not yet reached the age of 70.  The only thing that should be accepted here tonight by all sides of the House is that there has been a change in the policy that must be reversed.<\/p><p>That is universally accepted.  The official line may be that nothing has changed but the simple fact of the matter is that the policy has changed and it is causing undue hardship to families facing serious illness.  Most families have come face to face with illness at some point.  Such families are extremely vulnerable and they will accept whatever help they can get from the State.  The illness may involve a child, someone with profound disabilities since birth or a person who has recently been diagnosed with cancer.  The Government should simply accept the motion.  We can have our spats but people are suffering unnecessarily because of this change in policy.  They have enough to contend with already.<\/p><p> This morning reference was made to a letter from a consultant.  This is what the HSE requires at present.  A GP's letter counts for nothing.  Some of the people in the medical cards section are doing an exceptional job in communicating with us and trying to help people, but they are constrained by policy.  They are telling people a GP's letter is no good and that a consultant must write the letter.  It can take a long time to get such a letter, however.  To public representatives it may appear to be a simple task, but for families that are already under stress because of illness, it is a mountain to climb.  We need to be honest with each other and admit that the policy has changed and is causing hardship to those who are most in need of the State's support.<\/p><p> I recently dealt with the case of a 60 year old man who has suffered from progressive multiple sclerosis since he was 32 years old.  He had a medical card since his early 40s and he is confined to a wheelchair.  Thankfully, his multiple sclerosis has been in remission for the last year to 18 months, but he still needs support for his daily needs.  He was accused out of the blue of having a private pension from some mysterious company even though he retired on an invalidity pension.  This man and his wife and two adult children would dearly love to have a private pension but they do not know where the HSE got such a notion.  This family sacrificed everything to survive on an invalidity pension.  If he had been able to work there is no question that he would have done so.<\/p><p> Earlier this year one would have been forgiven for thinking that the changes were being applied on an area-by-area basis.  In one part of my constituency people were being asked for further information as part of a review of medical cards.  We can discuss the reviews elsewhere but the main reason I speak tonight is the discretionary medical card.  It is nonsense for anybody in Government to say the policy has not changed.  We have seen cases in which people are over the limit in respect of financial need, but I dealt with a case earlier this year in which the HSE refused to sanction a medical card, even though a consultant had written a letter stating that the individual's illness was terminal, because a private pension worth peanuts had to be examined or a box had to be ticked.<\/p><p> How often does the body established to examine this issue meet?  Is it simply a case of <i>carte blanche<\/i>for the policy?  I urge the Government to reflect on the motion in a humanitarian and realistic way and reverse the policy.  It is causing hardship for those with terminal illnesses and profound disabilities.  Children have also been targeted on the basis that their parents might have incomes above the limit.  Those who have held medical cards for lengthy periods due to the severity of their conditions have suffered enough.  Every Member of this House has received representations on this issue.  I urge the Government to examine this issue and to tell us the truth about it.  The only line I would accept is that the policy has fundamentally changed.  It should be changed back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900054#CCC00200","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381341300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>The Government rejects the notion that persons who were issued with medical cards on a discretionary basis are being deliberately targeted where their incomes exceed the HSE's income thresholds.  Despite what Opposition Deputies have stated, there is no target to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards in the HSE's national service plan for 2013.  It did not form part of budget 2013 and it is not Government policy.  During the course of the debate last night and again tonight, there have been numerous references to automatic medical cards and medical cards awarded on the basis of medical need.  As my colleagues stated last night, this is not the case.  There is not, and there never has been, an entitlement to a medical card for a person with a specific disease or on the basis of medical need. Under the Health Act 1970, persons who are unable to arrange GP services for themselves or their families without undue hardship qualify for medical cards.  Deputy Kelleher is familiar with that Act.<\/p><p>  Applications for medical cards are considered by the HSE on the basis of an assessment of the applicant's means by reference to the HSE's national assessment guidelines, which set out the income thresholds.  Where a person's income is within the guidelines, a medical card or a GP visit card will be granted by the HSE for three years in most cases.  However, the HSE has discretion to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service, having regard to his or her means.  I accept that the interpretation of that provision has changed over the years.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether the individual faces undue hardship in accessing GP services.<\/p><p>  The Deputies point out in their motion that the number of discretionary medical cards has decreased.  The documentary evidence shows this is correct but, rather than its being a deliberate targeting as suggested by the Deputies, there is a valid and, indeed, logical and rational explanation.  The HSE has indicated that there has been a decrease of approximately 24,000 in the number of discretionary medical cards between the start of 2011 and July 2013.  Of these 24,000 people, nearly 23,000 have qualified for medical cards on the basis of their means assessment alone, with no need for discretion to be considered.<\/p><p>I can further clarify the figures.  At the start of January 2011, there were more than 80,000 discretionary medical cards.  In July 2013, there were more than 56,000 discretionary medical cards out of a total of almost 1.9 million medical cards.  This shows a reduction on paper in the region of 24,000.  However, of that 24,000, almost 23,000 have been awarded medical cards on the basis of their means assessments.  As such, they have not lost their medical cards.  The number of people who hold medical cards on discretionary grounds has fallen in recent years, largely because more people who previously were marginally over the normal qualifying income limit became eligible for medical cards under the normal qualifying scales.  It is important to note that medical cards provided on the basis of means or where discretion is involved are identical and provide access to the same set of health services.<\/p><p> There is no target for reductions in discretionary medical cards in the 2013 HSE national service plan.  Last night, it was stated that the service plan set a target to reduce discretionary medical cards by 40,000.  This is incorrect.  The plan reads: &quot;Policy changes will reduce eligibility for approximately 40,000 people currently in receipt of medical cards, giving an anticipated net growth in 2013 of 60,000 medical cards.&quot;  Note that I stated &quot;medical cards&quot; and not &quot;discretionary medical cards&quot;.  Due to the current financial climate, it was necessary to identity measures to mitigate the escalating costs of the medical card scheme.  However, I assure the House that discretionary medical cards were not targeted in this regard.  There has been no change to the qualifying criteria for discretionary medical cards in the past year and the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer undue financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card.<\/p><p> Contrary to the suggestion that we are targeting people who need our support, the Government has provided funding to ensure that an additional 220,000 people are covered by the general medical services scheme, GMS, since entering office.  This means that more than 43% of the population has access to general practitioner, GP, services without any charge under the scheme, comprising 40.6% with medical cards and 2.7% with GP visit cards.<\/p><p> The HSE continues to issue medical and GP visit cards, with nearly 2 million people currently having access to free GP care.  In fact, the number of people with medical cards has increased by approximately 45% since the start of 2008 when the current economic crisis began.  This commitment to meet the additional financial costs of a greatly expanded medical card scheme makes light of any contention that this Government is targeting certain people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900055#DDD00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381341900,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Troy, who is sharing time with Deputies Kirk and Kelleher.

It is clear to anyone with an ounce of intelligence that there is a cynical campaign to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards.  At the beginning of 2011, there were more than 80,524 discretionary medical cards, a figure that reduced to 63,126 by the end of 2012.  This year has witnessed a further reduction.<\/p><p>  Listening to Government Deputies last night as well as to the Minister of State a few moments ago, one would wonder in what type of parallel universe they were living.  They believe that there has been no deliberate attempt to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards.  Are they holding clinics at all or engaging with their constituents?  The anecdotal evidence presented at my clinics and those of my colleagues tells of a deliberate attempt to withhold discretionary medical cards.  This is not just being asserted by Deputies on this side of the House.  Consider the comments of the outgoing Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, in this regard.  She stated that health cutbacks were being implemented by applying the letter of the law and removing an element of discretion that had previously applied.  She is not only renowned in this country, but also on the European stage.<\/p><p>  The Irish Cancer Society has cited concerns about the removal of medical cards from cancer patients.  At an Oireachtas health committee in July, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, confirmed that this was being done.  Professor Orla Hardiman, the neurologist who deals with the most cases of motor neurone disease, rubbished claims that applicants were provided with emergency medical cards within 24 hours as being untrue.<\/p><p>  I will provide examples from my area.  I have tabled a parliamentary question on the case of a 13 year old boy.  When he was diagnosed with autism at four years of age, he received a medical card.  It was renewed every two years until August of this year when, despite there being no change in his medical condition - if anything it had worsened - or in his parents' financial position, something else that had worsened, his application was refused.  That refusal is being appealed.<\/p><p>  In the case of a one year old child who was diagnosed with cancer, three and a half months have been spent toing and froing with the medical card office to secure a card.  What a thing to put that child's parents through.  Are they not going through enough trying to look after their sick child without having to worry about the financial hardship that their family was incurring?<\/p><p>  I am not pulling these cases from the sky.  I can provide the Ministers of State with the details of each.  A gentleman has been diagnosed with cancer for the third time.  On the two previous occasions, he was awarded a discretionary medical card.  He applied for a medical card in September 2012.  On 23 November, his application was refused.  He appealed and was further refused.  He appealed again.  He was refused again.  After appealing once more, he was finally granted a card on 19 September 2013.  For 12 months, a man who was critically, if not terminally, ill with cancer had to battle with an arm of the State to get his entitlement.<\/p><p>  Do not come in here and tell me that there has been no change to the conditions applying to people who try to obtain discretionary medical cards.  The clear tactic is to refuse and delay as much as possible.  This is causing unnecessary anxiety and is having a severe negative impact on persons who are critically ill and cannot afford to suffer such anxiety and pressure.<\/p><p>  I compliment Deputy Kelleher on introducing this important motion.  For God's sake, will the Ministers of State and the Government take on board the fact that this is a real issue and take the foot off the drive to withhold discretionary medical cards?  It is unfair, inhumane and beneath them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900056#EEE00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1381341900,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for the opportunity to contribute briefly on this important debate.

We are talking about discretionary medical cards.  People with pressing clinical needs are being put under undue or severe pressure.  In many circumstances where an illness is life-threatening, people simply do not have the cover or finances to meet the exceptional medical expenses involved.  Such expenses could include travelling for treatment at one of the centres of excellence, or the increased financial pressure on a family circle due to such a situation.  If one combines that with significant outgoings for adult children in third level institutions, it all adds up to very difficult circumstances for far too many families.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State should review this decision.  Given the number of discretionary medical cards granted compared to those withdrawn, the statistics graphically illustrate the difficulties involved.  The situation needs to be addressed urgently because there are too many families under severe stress.

Such circumstances lead to undue and unfair stress on too many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900057#FFF00500","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1381342500,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributions from Deputies on both sides of the House.  We do not claim to have a fount of wisdom on this side, but we know there is a difficulty concerning the granting of discretionary medical cards.  The review process is laborious and takes a long time.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State says there has been no change to how discretionary medical cards are awarded.  However, a profoundly disabled child with intellectual disabilities and many other medical complications may have been awarded a discretionary medical card based on the medical evidence presented at the time.  If that card is withdrawn at a later date, there has obviously been a change in how the awarding of such a card is assessed.  Such children should be entitled to the continuance of that medical card because there has been no change in their medical circumstances.  Regardless of the family's financial circumstances, the person was granted the card in his or her own right because of their medical condition. <\/p><p>  Discretionary medical cards are now being withdrawn.  Mr. Jonathan Irwin of the Jack and Jill Foundation has stated that parents are receiving cold letters from the HSE in relation to applications for medical cards and GP visit cards.  The letters make no mention of the child involved and boldly state: &quot;Your application will be considered closed unless additional information is received to support your application within 21 days of the date of this letter.&quot;  The HSE letters seek evidence of fire and contents insurance, mortgage payments and expenses incurred.  The Minister of State knows the form.<\/p><p>  The bottom line is that these people are applying for a medical card based on their extreme medical needs.  That is the basis for awarding a discretionary medical card.  Quite clearly, the HSE is looking at existing discretionary medical cards and is applying the financial guidelines in assessing them.  That is what is happening.  There is no change in the guidelines, but the financial guidelines under the Health Act 1970 are being applied to assess eligibility for discretionary medical cards.  That is how they are being withdrawn.  <\/p><p>  There is no point in trying to convince Deputies, who have made contributions in this debate as well as having tabled numerous parliamentary questions on the difficulties involved in securing discretionary medical cards for people with profound medical needs, that this is not the position.  That is why I have kept the motion's wording tight and specific, targeting the issue of discretionary medical cards.  <\/p><p>  There is a disconnect between what Ministers have said and what is being said by Government backbenchers, even though they used couched language with phrases like &quot;issues of communication&quot; and &quot;difficulties in informing families&quot;.  What they are really saying, however, is that discretionary medical cards are being withdrawn for no valid reason other than that there has been a deliberate change of policy in how such cards are assessed, granted, reviewed and appealed.  There can be no other reason that such children would have discretionary medical cards withdrawn.  If the Minister of State can explain that to me, I would like to hear it because, unfortunately, their medical conditions have not changed one bit.  The incontrovertible evidence is there in black and white in case after case, so I urge the Minister of State to review the process quickly.<\/p><p>  My  major concern is that this is a budgetary exercise.  Next week, the Minister of State will expect applause from Labour Party Deputies about granting free GP care to children under five.  Is the Government asking a profoundly disabled child to fund free GP care for under fives?  If so, we have a major problem in this country in terms of our priorities.  The Minister is saying he will give a free GP card to every child under five, but at the same time a person who is profoundly disabled, with major medical conditions, and who may have life-limiting illnesses, will not be granted a discretionary medical card based on their individual needs.  If so, that would simply be shameful.  Whatever is announced next week, I hope the Minister is not taking discretionary medical cards from thousands of people in order to fund his pet topic.<\/p><p>  I wish to thank every Deputy who has spoken on this motion.  I know the vote will be lost but I urge the Minister of State to re-examine this matter.  The Government amendment states that &quot;the HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in making reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing applicants&quot;.  That is the change of policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900057#FFF00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"vote","time":1381343100,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 75; N\u00edl, 46.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Michael Moynihan and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900058#GGG00100","aye":["1062","980","1016","946","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1092","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","991","986","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1068","1055","1051","1076","995","1106","949","973","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1180","997","1082","977","1038","1004","985","1034","1067","1045","1018","1060","1058","1073","1061","1081","964","947","1074","1013","1025","1048","961","978","1010","1095","950","1185","1024"],"nay":["1066","1020","1096","1032","1057","1083","1037","1015","1107","976","1022","1047","1084","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1179","983","945","962","998","1008","1017","993","965","981","992","1183","987","1052","1181","969","1044","1054","1028","1059","1005","1001","953","1178","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"vote","time":1381343100,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 76; N\u00edl, 45.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Michael Moynihan and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900058#GGG00200","aye":["1062","980","1016","946","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","991","986","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1068","1055","1051","1076","995","1106","949","973","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1180","997","1082","977","1038","1004","985","1034","1067","1045","1018","1060","1058","1073","1061","1081","964","947","1074","1013","1025","1048","961","978","1010","1095","950","1185","1024"],"nay":["1066","1020","1096","1032","1057","1083","1037","1015","1107","976","1022","1047","1084","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1179","983","945","962","998","1008","1017","993","965","981","992","987","1052","1181","969","1044","1054","1028","1059","1005","1001","953","1178","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381343100,"counter":552,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 October 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
