We all know we cannot have another year like last year in terms of our students or staff and further and higher education.  It was necessary from a public health point of view, but it is not sustainable.  We need to get people back to on-campus education.  We have been working really hard to do that and I will update the committee on where we are on that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  The over-riding objective here is a recognition that education and training is not just about what you learn in a lecture theatre or in a tutorial.  It is about how you learn, the people you learn with, and the experience of being with others.  Education is about the overall development of an individual.  There are aspects of learning that can only be imparted in person.  We have work to do to catch up on backlogs and to ensure that they are not further exacerbated as a result of some of the social distancing requirements that Covid-19 necessitated.  Furthermore, many students and learners do better when they attend lectures and classes in person.  That is not a universal, blanket statement, but it is true for many.  These are the reasons, or some of the reasons, we are planning a safe return to on-site learning this autumn.  I am pleased to say the Government has committed to a significant increase in on-site attendance in the third level sector in the next academic year.  This is not just the wish of one Minister, but this was a decision made by the Government in April and conveyed by the Government in the Taoiseach's address to the nation.  This was the decision reiterated by the Government in a memorandum in June, and again as recently as yesterday at our Cabinet meeting.<\/p> <p>  Following an intensive period of work with our sectors and stakeholders, including student representatives, staff, union representatives and management representatives, and with Government approval last month I published A safe return to on-site further and higher education and research in 2021-2022.  In a nutshell, what this plan means is that all students will have an on-site college experience next year.  It may not be every lecture or workshop, the numbers in the library may need to be smaller, and not all facilities will be open in exactly the same way as they were previously, just as things opened differently in towns and villages across Ireland as a result of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  However, let me be very clear about this, we are getting our students and learners back to college.  Whereas last year the presumption was that learning would be primarily online, this year the presumption is that learning will be mainly on-site. No doubt the prevailing public health guidelines will mean some learning is blended, but for all students, no matter what they study, on-site learning and attendance will be available.  Specifically, at the very minimum, on-site activity next year will include laboratory teaching and learning, classroom based teaching and learning, tutorials, workshops, smaller lectures, research, return to work-spaces and access to libraries with appropriate protective measures in place.<\/p> <p>  Other on campus non-educational activities and facilities such as sports, bars, canteens, clubs and societies will also operate in line with prevailing general public health advice.  This is important too.  If the sports club can be opened in the town or village in any part of Ireland, the sports club needs to be open in the college campus.  If the caf&eacute; can be open in a town or village outside the gates of the university, well the caf&eacute; or the canteen inside the gates needs to be open too, and the same for the bars, the clubs and societies.  We need to treat the college campus like a town or village because in many ways, that is what it is.<\/p> <p>  Teaching within lecture halls will take place on-site but this will depend on the room size and on other factors.  There will be moderation in numbers and there will need to be modification to normal practices.  What I mean by this, for example, is entry and exit, ventilation, or indeed the length of time of on-site lectures.  To be clear about this, I met yesterday with the representative bodies and they now need to do a body of work in regard to what modifications and safeguards they will put in place in regard to lecture halls.  There will be an intensive period of engagement on this, with a meeting of our Covid-19 steering committee next Friday which includes staff representatives, student representatives and management representatives as well.  All our plans have student and staff safety firmly built in.  The plan is endorsed by public health and by the Chief Medical Officer, so this is a plan with public health buy-in and that also is very important.<\/p> <p>  Of course, this is going to cost money.  It is important that we support our sector and our students.  At the Cabinet meeting yesterday, I updated Government on the progress in regard to planning and the expected level of on-site activity in further and higher education and research in the autumn.  Crucially, we also secured the approval of Government for a significant package of financial support, amounting to &euro;105 million for the third level sector.  I thank my colleague, the  Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for the work we have done together on that.  The package will include financial support for further and higher education to return on-site safely and in line with public health advice.  Crucially, it will also provide additional supports for students.  I am conscious that students have had a really difficult year.  Therefore, &euro;21 million of this additional funding will be allocated to provide specific extra supports for students in three areas.<\/p><p>There will be an additional &euro;3 million for student mental health and well-being services and an extra &euro;10 million for the student assistance fund.  This is the fund many of the members will know that students can draw money down from if they come on hard times, receive an unexpected bill or whatever.  I am especially proud of the creation my Department came up with last year in the third area, which is a new mitigating against educational disadvantage fund.  We are putting a further &euro;8 million into the latter.  This is a fund from which community education providers who are often working with the most vulnerable learners in towns and villages across Ireland can draw down moneys.  Last year, that fund was used to help meet the childcare costs of some people in community education.  It was also used to buy textbooks and laptops, with the focus being on people who might otherwise not be able to engage with our education system.<\/p><p> A working group for student and learner well-being and engagement was established by me in January.  I asked the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, to chair that working group.  I am pleased that we will start to make major progress on many of the proposals contained in the group's report as a result of the new funding announced yesterday.  I want to specifically thank USI for the leadership it has shown and its determination to achieve an effective outcome for students.<\/p><p> Higher education institutions and further education and training providers are progressing their own detailed planning and work in respect of a comprehensive return to on-site activity.  My officials and I have already engaged directly since the Government decision yesterday.  As already stated, through our Covid steering committee scheduled for next week, we will continue to support all stakeholders with further guidance and clarity, where required.  To enable the success of the plan, the sector has developed a pact of actions and commitments which has been agreed by my Department, its agencies, stakeholders, institutions and training providers.  This will support ongoing efforts with regard to the pandemic and ensure that planning is well-grounded in safe and sustainable practices.  Within the pact, institutions and providers have committed to addressing backlogs and deferred learning outcomes.  Similarly, stakeholder bodies have committed to engaging with institutions and providers to achieve significant increases to on-site teaching, learning, assessment and research.  In addition, specific commitments have also been provided in respect of international students in higher education with respect to accommodation and ongoing research.<\/p><p> The engagement and collaboration between my Department and the sector has been a key feature of how we have worked since the start of this Covid journey in March 2020.  I sincerely - and I mean this - thank student bodies, learners, staff organisations and management for their incredible collaborative efforts.  I have been taken by how collaborative the stakeholders have been and the solidarity they have shown around the table to achieve the best and safest outcomes for staff and for students who so need the best possible educational experience at third level.  This partnership has been instrumental in developing the plan for safe return and the continuation and intensification of this approach will be central to its successful implementation.  We will continue to meet as a group, share experiences and design solutions.<\/p><p> I want to say a quick word on three topics, namely, summer provision, rapid antigen testing and vaccination.  The vaccine programme is doing the heavy lifting with regard to how we can reopen our society.  Let us be quite clear about that.  The success of vaccines and the fact that, even with the Delta variant, they are proving so effective is what is helping us get back to and dare to dream again of getting back to normality and some forms of normality in our lives.  As Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I am delighted that the vaccine programme is now open to every single individual in this country from the age of 18-plus.  If you are an 18-year-old, you have the option of registering for the Janssen vaccine in the pharmacy, registering for the AstraZeneca vaccine with the HSE and now registering for the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines with the HSE.  I encourage all young people to get that vaccine because that vaccine is what will keep them, their community and our country safe and what will help us get our lives back on track.  It is great news for our sector and for young people that the programme has been accelerated.  I pay tribute to the HSE on that.<\/p><p> In order to enable summer provision, we are operating our sector on a more open basis for the summer period this year.  This is in compliance with current public health advice and the phased reopening of activities and the protective measures in place are working well.  We are getting our apprentices back on-site to complete their hands-on training which cannot be done online and we are getting our researchers back so they can advance their projects.<\/p><p> With regard to rapid antigen testing, I am fully committed to the role of rapid antigen testing as one part of a package of measures to support greater activity on-site.  Indeed the role of rapid antigen testing as a possible way of strengthening Covid-19 responses and providing reassurance to staff and others has been recognised in the recently published Covid-19 national protocol for employers and workers.  I am glad to say that the third level sector has been leading the way, while others have been debating the merits and demerits and chatting, considering and thinking about it, the third level sector has gotten on with it.  I thank it for that.  I thank it for its leadership.<\/p><p> There are two separate studies under way which will investigate and examine the potential for rapid antigen testing.  We have University College Cork, UCC, University College Dublin, UCD, the National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway and Trinity involved in what they call UniCoV rapid antigen testing pilot.  Last week, myself, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the HSE announced five more pilots in further education and training including in counties Mayo, Galway, Cavan and Dublin.  The Secretary General of my Department has written to the expert advisory group on rapid testing, which comes under the remit of the Department of Health, asking for its assistance in determining the appropriate role of rapid testing should we decide to expand it further, pending the results of the pilot outcome.  I look forward to adopting its advice as well.<\/p><p> Let me leave the members with the message before we get into the engagement: we are going back to college in the new academic year.  Education has been deemed an essential service - all of education - not just education that stops at secondary school.  The Government has deemed education as an essential service.  We need, from a mental health and well-being point of view along with an educational point of view, to make this happen.  I have spent the past year listening to students, learners and staff down a camera on my computer and I have heard them say time and again that they want to go back.  This is especially the case for learners and students who are more vulnerable.<\/p><p> We have learned good lessons and there are some positives coming from Covid-19 which we might reflect on, as well in terms of things we would like to keep in the education sector but in general, we now need to make sure we can get our students and our staff safely back to college campuses and training centres at the start of the new academic year.  I look forward to working with this committee in ensuring we make that an absolute reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#A00500","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Before we call on Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, I compliment the Minister.

I commend the collaboration that has happened.  There have been huge collaborative efforts across the third level sector.  We all witnessed that over the year and a half of the pandemic.  I hope it will continue.  I have no reason to think it will not because that is the way we can develop and bring forward the third level sector throughout the country and, mind you, right across the 32 counties.<\/p> <p>  I also acknowledge the extra funding, especially that allocated for student support.  I hope that money will go directly to the students and families who most need it.  That is probably the next challenge for us.<\/p> <p>  The Minister set out the position regarding the safe return of students.  This is also a really good opportunity for him to address some of the anxieties students are experiencing.  One of those is in terms of accommodation and the new legislation.  The Minister will be aware of the legislation brought in on 9 July.  There is a month set aside for that legislation to come into force.  However, I am extremely concerned that I am getting reports from families and parents indicating that accommodation providers are putting pressure on them to pay large sums of money upfront.  Those providers are trying to get ahead of the legislation in that regard.  There seems to be a loophole in this regard.  Can the Minister confirm the date on which the law to limit a landlord's ability to ask for multiple months' rent in advance will come into effect?<\/p> <p>  In view of the fact that the legislation allows for students to opt out and pay multiple months upfront if they wish to do so, what safeguards are in place to ensure that landlords will not simply favour those students and thereby make the legislation worthless?  I am concerned.  I accept that this matter does not come directly under the Minister's remit, but I know he will share my concerns.<\/p><p>A Kerry woman put it to me yesterday that it is like telling the fox not to eat the chickens when it is let into the henhouse.  It seems that students are trapped in that at the moment.  Will the Minister speak to that, in terms of speaking to the families, students and accommodation providers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#B00300","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and acknowledge, regarding the extra funding, the work and the survey she did, which was helpful and informed much of the discussion.<\/p> <p>  On the accommodation legislation, I welcome the change of legislation.  It had cross-party support in the Oireachtas.  It does two things.  It limits the amount of upfront deposit a renter can be asked for to no more than one month's rent and one month's deposit, so no more than two months in total.  Secondly and crucially, it means students in student accommodation do not have to give more than 28 days' notice to terminate their rental agreement.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that this does not come under my direct remit but, from checking with the Residential Tenancies Board, the information available suggests the legislation was signed into law on 9 July.  All parts of it, except section 6, came into operation on that date.  Section 6, which deals with rent setting, came into operation on 16 July.  I do not suggest what the Deputy has heard is not true, but I would be concerned if it was the case.  My understanding is the law of the land has been clear since 16 July.  I would be happy to engage with the Deputy on any cases.<\/p> <p>  In relation to any issue a renter has, the agency to assist is always the Residential Tenancies Board.  I think the Deputy and I share the view that we need to look at how to provide more purpose-built, college-owned student accommodation.  I am in active discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform around the borrowing framework, particularly for technological universities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#C00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>What seems to be happening is there is a key part in section 7(5) of the legislation which state, \"This section shall apply to a tenancy created not earlier than one month after the passing of the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021.\"  That seems to be the section that is being exploited.  I am glad the Minister is sending out that message.  He is saying it is illegal for landlords or student accommodation providers to force students and families to pay multiple months upfront.

I have discussed this with their representative bodies and they are satisfied and determined to implement the legislation.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy said, there is an exemption.  Some students, though I do not know many, and perhaps international students may wish to pay more than one month upfront and there is the option to do that.

I have had much toing and froing with SUSI since that time.  We need to communicate with students and their families.  Even if their grant or partial grant has been allocated from SUSI, once they stop the PUP, they can request an internal review by emailing the SUSI support desk.

We discussed it on the floor of the D&aacute;il on many occasions.<\/p> <p>  I will give the Deputy the latest statistics from SUSI.  As of 11 July, more than 80,000 applications have been received from new and returning students, of which 56,000 have been processed and 49,500 of those have been deemed eligible for support.  In the last academic year, SUSI processed 96,000 applications with 76,000 students awarded funding.  SUSI estimates an overall 2% increase in applications compared to last year.  The increase in the postgraduate fee grant and in the fee threshold for postgraduate students has also made a significant impact on applications.  SUSI forecasts a 133% increase in grant approval this year.<\/p> <p>  I echo what the Deputy said on the PUP.  What she said and how she said it is correct.  The way the change of circumstances review works in SUSI is if you have been receiving a fund, income or whatever and are no longer receiving it, you can say to SUSI: \"Please review my application because it is not fair or accurate to assess me on income that I no longer have.\"  That is the way the PUP will be treated.  For better or worse, students will not be in a position to receive the pandemic unemployment payment from the start of the new academic year.  Therefore, the pandemic unemployment payment paid to them cannot be used against them.  The system cannot have it both ways.  I am talking to SUSI directly and with my officials about making this as easy as possible for students.  I cannot give a specific answer on how it intends to do that but I would like it to email all the students and tell them what to do if they have been on PUP.  I am working with it to see if it can get a direct communication to all students to make it as clear and simple as the Deputy has done.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on the issue that this will have a big impact on SUSI.  It will.  SUSI often takes on temporary staff for a limited period.  It has now kept on those staff.

We also received over 9,000 survey responses, which is a very significant number.

The Minister of State and I will have details on that next week.  <\/p> <p>  I will ask the Minister of State, who is leading for us on the apprenticeship scheme, to respond on the apprenticeship action plan and the Senator's questions.  UniCoV is working really well.  I thank Professor Breda Smith, the public health lead for the mid-west, who is leading the charge on that.  Students can now go to the dedicated website where they can register if they are in Trinity College, UCD, NUI Galway or UCC.  I am delighted that five more sites are in place, including one in the Senator's region.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding researchers, we provided significant additional funding to help with research extensions.  If this is required again, we will certainly provide it.  This is a very pure Covid cost and the Government needs to meet what are legitimate Covid costs.  Delays in research are not the fault of the researcher or institution; they are the fault of Covid.  We have worked very closely with the research community to address any required extensions and will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#D00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>To address Senator Dolan's question about apprenticeships, as the committee will be aware, 61 apprenticeship schemes are up and running and a further 18 are in development.

We will get the committee a note with an update on the status of each of the apprenticeships in development.  We are being contacted continually and are engaging continually with interested parties on the development of new apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  I was down in the west, at the Petersburg outdoor education centre in Clonbur, about two weeks where we launched the arboriculture apprenticeship programme, which is tree surgery for people who do not have the Latin skills.  There was significant interest in that.

There is considerable demand for qualified tree surgeons.<\/p> <p>  I met with a group in Limerick through our mid-west regional skills manager, Joe Leddin, who were interested in progressing an apprenticeship relating to cybersecurity.  Many industry players such as Dell are very invested in that.  There is a lot going on in terms of development.  I received an inquiry recently from a number of golf professionals.

The work being done by the active consent programme is NUI Galway is world class.  We will now have a resource where we will be able to train and support students and staff in sexual consent.  This will roll out from the start of the new academic year.  The Senator will be aware that I wrote to every institution in Ireland to ask them to publish an individual action plan on sexual harassment.  They should not just hide behind or under national guidelines.  What are they going to do on their campuses to have a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment?  I am really pleased that all those action plans have been submitted.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the technological university for Connacht-Ulster, I am delighted to see that the international advisory panel is in town - virtually - and is meeting people in the region.

I was curious as to how the Department would work.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State have made this new Department work.<\/p><p>I hope that this Department is a feature of public policy into the future because it would be very difficult to have this type of conversation in the old Department that had everything under its remit, with one senior Minister.<\/p><p>The Minister has been very strong over the course of the year on all of the issues that have been touched on today.  I congratulate him on that.  If third level is to open up in September, as the Minister intends, it would be wonderful for all of those young people, and the students who are not so young.  For many of us, attending third level education or colleges of further education was life forming.  It was not necessarily just about what we learned in the lecture halls or tutor rooms.  Mixing with other people from other backgrounds and other parts of the country and the world formed our identities.  I congratulate the Minister on that plan.<\/p><p> The committee will have to meet again to consider the Cassells report.  We must also talk about literacy, an issue on which the Minister is very committed.<\/p><p> Another issue I wish to raise is how we get role model professions that are under the Minister's remit to be more reflective of the society they serve.  I have spoken to the Teaching Council and the Irish National Teachers Organisation on the issue.  Let us consider, for example, the role of teaching.  At primary level especially the teaching profession does not reflect the children in the classroom.  We need to have proactive methodologies to encourage more working class children, children from a disadvantaged background, children with disabilities, children with an international background and children from a Traveller background into role model professions such as teaching.  The CAO system is just not going to do it.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  Other role model professions can also be powerful in that regard.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the optimism around what will happen in this country in September, what is happening in the UK has worried everybody.  We are not in control of that.  Ireland's response to the Covid crisis was always contingent on what was happening next door.  The Minister and Minister of State may not be able to repeat what I say, but what is happening across the water appears to be very ill-disciplined and reports are not encouraging with regard to the level of infection and the potential for new variants.  If this happens over the course of the summer in the UK, and given that we have opened up to a certain degree here, I suggest we will still be talking about our envisaged opening up in August.  Notwithstanding the well-placed optimism, I believe we need to be mindful of these factors.<\/p><p> My next question for the Minister is about next year's leaving certificate, which impacts significantly on the Department.  Would it be a good course of action for the Department and the Department of Education to take time to engage with the educational partners at this point?  If they were to roll out leaving certificate 2022 as they rolled out leaving certificate 2021, we would not be worrying about the leaving certificate in the coming spring arising from the potential loss of in-class teaching.  This student cohort has already lost a large amount of in-school teaching.  Could a quick decision be made on this issue to prepare for all of the knock-on effects for the third level sector, which falls under the Minister's remit?<\/p><p> I touched on a few issues and I am not expecting a full response on the Cassells report and all the issues I have raised.  Considering what is happening in the UK and given that the situation is unpredictable, the big issue is that it would make everybody's life easier if we made a decision as quickly as possible on the leaving certificate for 2022, as we did on leaving certificate 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#D00700","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his questions and kind comments about the work of the Department.  I thank all of the officials who are trying to build a new Department.  While it is not quite being built from scratch, it is taking many functions from the Department of Education and the previous Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and loading them together at a time when everyone is working from home and so on.  The officials have risen to the challenge and I am very lucky, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to have such a dedicated team of officials who are passionate about this work.<\/p> <p>  I am also delighted that the new Department is causing Members of the Oireachtas to talk about the sector.  We have a dedicated parliamentary questions session and committee discussions.  We are getting a chance to discuss, explore and come up with ideas and solutions on issues that ran the risk of getting lost.  I say that meaning no disrespect to other Departments.  The proof will be in the eating and we need to get a lot of things delivered over the next while.  I hope here will be a cross-party consensus that there is real value in this Department because, without getting into the international tax debate, our future economic and social well-being will become more and more reliant on what we call \"human capital\", or people, and investing in people.  That is what this Department is about.<\/p> <p>  I confirm to the Deputy that I have now received the final report from Mr. Peter Cassells.  I use the word \"final\" intentionally because I do not believe we need another report or a cross-party committee to commission another report.  We do not need to build a shelf to put the report on.  We now need to come up with solutions.  I rule out student loans here and now.  I have no interest in them, do not agree with them and do not believe in them.  They do not work.  They might work on paper but they do not work in reality.  We will not be introducing student loans.  We will come up with a way of moving forward on that.  I hope to bring proposals to Cabinet later this year and, as part of the Estimates process, to be able to make some progress.<\/p> <p>  I would love to have a proper conversation about role models in the professions and how we can help through reform of the CAO, new pathways to work and the work being done on apprenticeships by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins.  I would love to discuss that further with the committee.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Covid variants, the Deputy is right that we are in uncertain times.  We know, however, that the vaccines work.  My message to everybody is that we will see case numbers rising.  If we look at what has happened in Scotland, the Netherlands and Portugal - just three examples - we saw numbers rise, peak and then begin to come back down.  Vaccines work.  Younger people can now get vaccinated and young people aged between 18 and 22 are being vaccinated today.  Those aged 16 and 17 years will be vaccinated shortly.  Before the new college year resumes, I believe that every young person will have had an opportunity to be vaccinated.  While college attendance or access to education is not contingent on vaccination, we will see the benefit of the vaccine programme in the weeks and months ahead.  Our reopening plans have been endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer.  This is not the Department doing a solo run.  It is very much a plan endorsed by public health advice.<\/p> <p>  On the leaving certificate, I am aware of the point the Deputy is making and I am sure he would never wish to draw me into another Minister's remit.  The leaving certificate, however, is a matter for the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and her Department.  I will say that it is an incredible testament to the Minister and, more important, to all of the stakeholders, education providers, teachers, the State Examinations Commission, school principals, students, special needs assistants, SNAs, and everybody else involved that we managed to have leaving certificate examinations this year and that they went off pretty well.  In the middle of a global pandemic Ireland held leaving certificate exams and provided students with the choice that they wanted around calculated grades.  We learned a lot from listening to second level students this year as opposed to just telling them what was best for them.  They showed themselves to be constructive and pragmatic and they helped to design the system.  It was not the most straightforward system.  We were one of the few countries in the world to take a dual approach.  I commend the students on that.<\/p> <p>  From my Department's perspective, rapid clarity on what next year will look like is always useful.  The Minister is well aware of that and will, I presume, want to move in that direction also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#E00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I offer a big welcome to the Minister and the Minister of State.  It is good to see them, although it is not in the committee room where we would like to be.  Hopefully we will have some reopening of in-person committee meetings as well as a reopening of third level.  It is important that we were reminded that this will not just be a reopening of third level but a reopening of in-person learning.  Huge work has been done by all of the staff and students over the past year and a half.  It has been incredibly difficult for them.  It is important to recognise that they have gone above and beyond.<\/p> <p>  I welcome yesterday's launch of the active consent programme by the Minister.  I am cautiously optimistic for the programme.  I would like some clarity on what happens when a third level institution has a plan, publicises the plan and then fails to meet expectations.  I hope that will not happen.<\/p><p>We have had pre-legislative scrutiny over the past couple of weeks and we all recognise the importance of the independence of third level institutions.  That can come undone when targets are not met, however.  What is the Minister's plan to ensure these targets and plans are put in place and enforced?<\/p><p> With regard to the reopening, I understand the funding from yesterday is again very much on an institution by institution basis and how they might manage that funding.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I know there is specific ring-fenced funding, particularly with regard to mitigating educational disadvantage, for instance.  When it comes to giving security to these staff around a safe reopening, is there a plan around ventilation and carbon dioxide monitors, in particular, in order that people can see the levels of ventilation in their workplace?  A third level institution is absolutely a social good but it is also a workplace and people need to have confidence.<\/p><p> My third issue for the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, is around apprenticeships.  We see today that Ireland is an incredibly expensive place to build.  What place does the Minister of State believe his Department has in helping us to achieve our targets around building but particularly from a green perspective and all the targets we have around greening our economy?  It is a concern that we have a backlog regarding apprenticeships.  What does the Minister of State see in the future, over the next year or two, to make sure we have the workers we need for that green economy?<\/p><p> I am not only interested in the climate aspect but also in biodiversity and around having ecologists in place, for instance.  That will be needed for forestry and farming.  Macra na Feirme appeared before us at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  Young farmers are asking to have ecologists help them as well.  It goes across all Departments but it is very much reliant on the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#E00300","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>First, I thank Senator O'Reilly very much for making the point better than I did that we are not talking about a reopening of third level because, of course, third level never closed in terms of the delivery of the service.  I say that out of respect to the staff and students, who worked in the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances to keep the show on the road.  People managed to graduate, albeit in a different from normal way.  It often was not a graduation ceremony in person.  I thank the staff for going, as the Senator quite rightly said, above and beyond.<\/p><p>All I can tell people absolutely honestly is that in my many engagements with staff unions, student unions and management bodies, I was really taken by the common purpose they all had to do well by the learner and follow public health advice.  I have never asked and will never ask them to do anything that goes contrary to public health advice.  I know they will never ask me to do anything that is not in the best interests of students and educational outcomes.  I really want to say that.  We are talking about the return to on-site education but not a reopening because it did not close.  It just had to move online.<\/p><p>A really interesting question, which I am glad the Senator asked me, was about the issue of following action plans and what happens if people do not deliver.  I take the point she made and I echo it.  I see much goodwill, determination and passion across the sector to implement its action plans on sexual harassment and sexual violence.<\/p><p>The Senator asked a valid question, however, about what happens if something goes wrong and how we can ensure targets are met.  Really, the answer is twofold.  For the very first time in the history of the State, we have made it a requirement that every individual institution reports against delivery on its action plan to the HEA every year.  That is important.  Up until now, we have been asking our colleges to report on how they are doing on financial management, etc.  We are now saying, as an Oireachtas and a Government, that we believe taking a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and making sure campuses are safe is as important, if not more important, than many other issues.  We want them, therefore, to report annually and not - I do not mean this flippantly - against woolly national frameworks but against their own specific institutional action plan and what they said they would do in college X.  That is the first change both culturally and practically.<\/p><p>The second is exactly what the Senator said around the legislation.  We have a chance to get the HEA governance legislation and higher education governance right.  I thank the committee for the work it is doing on pre-legislative scrutiny.  I want to get that legislation passed this year come hell or high water.  We can work late at night like we have done many times to pass important legislation.  It is essential we get this done by the end of the year.  We need to know we have modern, fit for purpose, 21st century governance structures and that is not interfering with autonomy or education independence, which I value and respect so much and which is essential.  It is, however, absolutely appropriate that we make sure the governance structures are fit for purpose.  I would hope, as we begin to work through it, that we get the balance right between protecting autonomy and making sure the values and important national priorities we have around issues like sexual harassment are absolutely delivered on.<\/p><p>The third issue goes back to the reopening, about which I have a couple of things to say.  First, everything we do on reopening will be grounded in public health advice.  That is important to instill confidence in our staff, students and the communities in which the institutions are based.  That is why our plan for reopening the third level sector - I am now using the &quot;reopening&quot; term - I should say our plan to return to on-site education is endorsed by public health and by the Chief Medical Officer.  It is important that I say this to reassure staff and students that we are asking them to do only what our public health doctors believe is safe to do.<\/p><p>The second issue is the funding we have provided, on which I can send the committee a note.  It is effectively to make sure that any changes can be made to campus layout in terms of health protection equipment such as face masks, personal protective equipment, PPE, other essential equipment for laboratories and workshops and additional college health and welfare service provision as well as taking into consideration additional cleaning and sanitation costs, costs associated with remote working that has been required to date, any <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments to contractors required under public work contracts, staff and facility costs and testing and tracing costs.  It is not money for a black hole; it is very much money to make sure the college campuses are safe for staff and students.<\/p><p>And yes, when I talked about some of the measures we will want to see taken to modify lecture halls to ensure people are safe, policy around ventilation will be a very important part of that.  We will be intensively engaging in that with stakeholders over the course of the next week before we have our Covid-19 steering committee meeting.  I will hand over to the Minister of State for the rest of the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#F00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I am conscious there are concerns out there about variants and such issues.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is correct when he emphasises the positive impact that vaccines are having on the pandemic.<\/p><p>We are in a much different place now than we were 12 months ago.<br\/><br\/>Has the Minister read the AONTAS report that was published yesterday, which is reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today?  A number of issues in it were of considerable concern to me.  One is that 54% of third-level students who had been surveyed reported that they had struggled with motivation and lack of structure in the online learning.  More significantly, 59% said they struggled with their mental health as a result of how the pandemic has affected their lives and specifically third-level education.

I had the honour of saying a few words at the launch of the report yesterday.  It is a really good piece of work.  I thank Ms Niamh O'Reilly, who heads up AONTAS, and all of the team.  They are members of our Covid steering group which meets regularly, generally on a Friday.  That is very important, as they are often the voice of community education.  We have pretty good structures in place for talking.  We also talk about universities, institutes of technology and technical universities.  That is very important, but there is a whole community education sector that is often working in all of our constituencies with the most vulnerable learners and providing people with second-chance education.  AONTAS does incredible work.  What it found in the survey goes to the heart of why the Government wants to do two things: first, to get students back to college campuses and to have on-site learning.  We recognise that for some learners, especially mature learners, for example people in their 40s with a couple of kids, a mortgage and a full-time job, packing the bags and going to college might not be an option, but school-leavers in particular want the full college experience.  The report very much highlights the challenges that many students have found when they had to do college effectively in their bedroom or on the corner of the kitchen table.  We want to get students back to campus.<\/p> <p>  The second thing we want to do is recognise that while students are excited about going back to campus, a lot of them will be also very anxious.  In many ways, people are anxious as they try to resume parts of normal life.  That is why yesterday we took the decision as a Government to allocate significant extra money, &euro;21 million, for additional student supports.  The money is being allocated to the student assistance fund, the mental health and well-being fund and a new educational disadvantage fund.  It is very much grounded in the reasons that came to light in the AONTAS report.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for being a firm believer for some time in getting students back to college campuses.  I accept there will be issues of concern but once we get people vaccinated, we must look at how we can live safely.  We cannot live in a country where we can go on holidays to Spain, have a pint, and go in and out of shops but where we cannot access in-person education.  We have decided education is a priority, just like we have decided lots of other parts of society are a priority.

I will ask the institutions to show that flexibility.  I often think of the soon-to-be second year college students who physically left a school building in March 2020.  In many cases, they have not been physically inside an educational setting since then.  It would be unusual not to need a period to re-adapt.  Anyone would need that after such a level of disruption.  I have spoken to the presidents of many universities, institutes of technology and other educational institutions and I think they get this.  I will ask that they would show flexibility.  The first priority must be the well-being of students, getting them safely back, looking out for them, looking after them and showing flexibility.  We should remember that second years need to be inducted into college in just the same way as first-year students.  The extra funding must be used in a way that works.  It will be different from institution to institution.  Crucially, we must listen to the voice of students on how to use the funding.  Let us not tell the students how best to use the mental health and well-being funding, but talk to students and individual student unions and come up with plans.  We all need to show that little bit of flexibility because there is a huge amount of anxiety out there as people try to resume activities that were normal but have not happened in quite a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#G00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>International students play a significant part in the third-level education system, in respect of funding to a certain extent as well.

If one is coming from a country that is on the red list, the law of the land is that one needs to go into mandatory hotel quarantine.

Deputy Conway-Walsh will have read the framework we published.  What we have said is that at a minimum it is safe to come to the classroom, workshops, tutorials, laboratories, etc.  That will happen and it is not envisaged to happen at reduced numbers.  That is because we have safely had people back in school classrooms for some time.  The outstanding issue on which work is being done is the lecture halls.  Even within the lecture hall, not all lecture halls are the same size, shape or construct.  What we are doing over the course of the coming week is asking the sector to look at what modifications it can put in place to make the lecture hall a safe environment.  I do not believe there will be a one-size-fits all scenario because the infrastructure is very different.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly mentioned ventilation.  Another issue is the length of time of a lecture.  We know that the longer one spends in a room, the greater is the risk.  Face masks are another issue.

I was answering the broader question about timetabling for students in Irish higher education institutions.  While I do not mean this about the Deputy or her interpretation of this, I think the issue of English language schools has been somewhat misrepresented.  What we are saying about English language schools is in line with the public health advice that we have about increasing summer provision of further and higher education.  I said in my opening statement that as we prepare for a broader resumption of further and higher education in general in September, we are allowing a little more to happen over the summer months, whether in laboratories, apprenticeships or research.<\/p> <p>  Regarding English language schools, many students who already came to Ireland in good faith have been left somewhat stranded.  I am not blaming anyone.  They came to Ireland to learn English but because of Covid, they were not able to access lessons because schools were closed.  We have a duty of care to them.  While the Deputy gave a figure of 10,000 students, the average number in a class here is seven.  We are talking about far fewer students than were ever in a primary or secondary school class.  I am not telling the English language schools that they must open.  They may opt to remain closed.  They may opt to provide blended learning or to continue to operate wholly online.<\/p> <p>  The resumption of in-person activity is subject to there being no deterioration in the public health situation or changes to public health advice, which I have yet to receive.  We see this as a small, cautious, conservative stepping stone on a pathway to broader recovery.  A voluntary moratorium on recruitment of new students has been in place.  I do not want to see new students recruited into the English language education sector at present.  I would like us to get to that point but we are not there yet.  If there were breaches of that, I would view that seriously.  I would view it as a breach of faith regarding the agreements that we have with the sector and I would act accordingly.  The Deputy knows that I am going to say that the visa issue is a matter for the Minister for Justice, because it is.  I would not like to see any student lose out or face alterations to visa terms and conditions as a result of not being able to attend a lecture due to an underlying health condition.

It means that something like 67% of apprenticeships are waiting for off-site training.  I am concerned about that.

The Minister, Deputy Harris, the entire Department and I share the concern which the Deputy has articulated about the backlog.  There is no point in me explaining how the backlog has arisen.  The Deputy is well aware of that.  We were constrained due to the various lockdowns we have had to endure since March 2020 and because the majority of off-the-job training has to take place in person across our further education training centres, institutes of technology and technological universities.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that the figures I provided in the D&aacute;il during parliamentary questions were for the end of May.  The Deputy has received updated figures from the Department.  We are continuing to engage with SOLAS, the Higher Education Authority and all the stakeholders across the sector.  There are two main stakeholders, namely, the apprentices and the training providers who are public servants working in our further education and training centres, education and training boards and technological universities.  They are working might and main to address the backlog.  They are aware of the pressure it is creating for the system and for individuals, with regard to allowing them to progress with their careers.  That feeds into the various sectors in which these apprentices will ultimately work.<\/p><p> The vast majority of the backlog relates to the craft apprentices.  We prioritised a return to on-site learning in March 2021 and this will continue throughout the summer, subject to public health advice, with restricted numbers.  A three-step plan is being drawn up to tackle the backlog, particularly in the craft apprenticeships, with a view to addressing the backlog over 12 to 15 months.  That is being worked on by SOLAS and the further and higher education providers.  As I said to the Deputy when she raised the issue in the D&aacute;il recently, an additional &euro;20 million in capital expenditure was provided to SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority to facilitate 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system, and an additional &euro;12 million had already been allocated to support additional classes and teaching capacity.  We are aware of this, as is the Department.  Our dedicated public servants right across the sectors are aware of it and they are dedicated to addressing the problem with a plan and addressing the backlog over a period of time.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#H01000","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>One of the challenges of being so far down in the running order is that a great number of the questions I was going to ask have already been asked.  There is a lot of optimism and good feeling on the committee this morning and I share that.  The Minister and the Minister of State have announced many good things.  I welcome the mental health aspect of their announcements in particular.  That is going to be so important.  Other Deputies and Senators, and the Minister, have referred to the fact that so much time has been spent by leaving certificate cohorts in their own rooms.  I worry about those introverted students and I am glad that we are beginning to think about structuring their participation back into what can be an upheaval and quite a transition for any school leaver in normal times, when moving from a secondary school environment into a college or university environment.  That can be quite difficult.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the mitigating against educational disadvantage fund, which is also important.  I was delighted to hear the Minister ruling out student loans.  We have a challenge in how we fund our third level sector but I am glad to hear that student loans do not form a part of that solution in the Minister's mind.  I agree with him on that.<\/p> <p>  In-person education and the drive to get back into the classroom or the lecture hall are important.  I know this from my own teaching experience but a number of college lecturers have also told me that they just cannot read a room online.  They cannot single people out or spot those students who may need a hand on the shoulder or a little bit of additional time.  They cannot even get a sense of whether the room is on board and engaged in the same way on Zoom.  We all know this from Zoom activities.<\/p> <p>  I was interested to hear the Minister refer to the borrowing framework for technological universities because that is one of the central concerns and worries for people involved in the technological university model.  I do not expect him to answer now as to whether that work is ongoing but he can be sure that members of the committee would love to know more about that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State has dealt with some of the questions I was going to pose about apprenticeships.  We need to be planning not just how we upskill our apprentices but how we catch up.  This is mission-critical to solving the housing crisis because we need to make sure we have the skills in place as well as the funding and the political will, which we absolutely have, to solve the housing crisis.  We also need the people with those skills.  We are long on optimism today and maybe a little short on detail.  That is understandable because of the rate of change in the transmission of this virus but there has also been a positive rate of change in the roll-out of the vaccine.  That makes it difficult for us to define exactly where we are going to be in four or six weeks.  Are we going to see clear, specific advice in time for reopening?  I make specific reference to WIT.  Last year, its president, Professor Willie Donnelly, went out on a limb, and was subsequently shown to be correct in doing so, by asking students not to return to campus.  It was a very difficult decision and he left himself exposed to criticism by making what ultimately turned out to be the correct decision.  Are we going to get that specific information out to people in a timely way?<\/p> <p>  I read something fascinating recently about the impact the Spanish flu had on the built environment of the 1920s and I think ventilation will be this century's response to this pandemic.  Solving the ventilation issue will do much more than solve Covid.  It will have a lot of positive knock-on benefits, not just on education but across our built environment.  That would not be money poorly spent.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to international students.  I have touched on the challenges in funding third level and international students form a big part of the current funding model.  Does the Minister have any further detail on the numbers expected this year or modelling on the funding implications?  Do we have any specific requirements for incoming international students, such as vaccination, digital passports, etc.?  I ask the Minister to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#J00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>On the borrowing framework for technological universities, I am aware of the Deputy's interest in this matter, both from a regional point of view in the south east and more broadly in terms of the roll-out of technological universities.  We are engaging intensively with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.  It could be a potential game changer for technological universities in Ireland and for the regions.  In fairness to the Departments, it is not a straightforward issue.  It requires a bit of work but it is worth doing that work and it is under way.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about specific information for students and he put that across in a very fair way.  I would contend that we have published a lot of information already.  The benefit of the information this year, as opposed to last year when this new Department barely existed, is that we have been working very collaboratively.  The document we have published to show how people are going to get safely back to college campuses was written by staff, students and management and has been endorsed by public health, my Department and the Government.<\/p> <p>  On not one occasion but three occasions - in April, June and July - the Government has said that we want to get our students back to campus.  Instead of taking an all-or-nothing approach, we developed a framework and that framework details what people can expect at a minimum and at a maximum in terms of on-site education.  At a minimum, tutorials, classroom-based work, laboratories and libraries will come back.  Other facilities like societies, clubs and sports can come back in line with the overall advice outside the college campus.  At the maximum end, we will get back to the larger scale lectures.  It seems prudent, according to public health, to plan for the lectures now but we are planning for them in a way that will require modification.  That modification relates to some of the issues upon which the Deputy has touched, such as ventilation, face masks, duration, entry and exit points.<\/p> <p>  I commend Professor Willie Donnelly on all the work he has done, and did last year too, but I would like us to have an overarching framework and understanding as to what those modifications are, in order that we can all speak with one voice.  We must accept that there will be differences between WIT and other places, for example, but there would be an overarching framework for how to safely modify lecture halls for staff and students in a way that is endorsed by public health.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of international students, the basic rule of thumb is that the same rule applies to a student coming in as to anybody else when it comes to the digital Covid certificate or mandatory hotel quarantine.  We do not discriminate positively or negatively in favour of students coming in because the virus does not discriminate positively or negatively, whether people are here on their holidays, for work or for college.  However, we go one step further.  Something that worked very well last year was that we worked with institutions, particularly our larger institutions where international students tend to come to study, to put in place measures to help the students self-quarantine if that is the requirement, depending on where they have come from.  For example, we would have a meet-and-greet service at the airport, where students would be safely accompanied to college accommodation and so on.<\/p><p>Those measures and protocols, which worked really well last year, will be in place again this year.  Part of the &euro;105 million funding package announced yesterday includes supports for the colleges around welcoming those international students safely to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#J00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State.

For the entire system to work as effectively as it did over the past year is testament to the efforts of staff and students and indeed all the Department and agency officials as well.  I commend both the Minister and Minister of State on expanding, in these difficult times, particularly for students, the number of places available in both higher and further education.  It is very significant.  The level of access we have to further and higher education and the participation rates, which are among the highest in the world, are something this country should be really proud of.  It is part of the debate and we should be shouting about it.  We have moved on from the corporation tax rate.

I appreciate there is the big picture but there are also the losses over the past year to 18 months.<\/p> <p>  On the specific issue of international students, which the Minister raised, I wish to discuss the matter of international students who have received a vaccine not approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  These include the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.  This is an issue for graduates returning to Ireland as well, as the Minister knows.  It is particularly an issue for significant numbers of students coming from Asia.  It is up to each member state to make a determination, if some of the WHO vaccines are approved, to allow those students to enter.  Let us say a student is coming from a country not on the red list but the student has received a non EMA-approved vaccine.  Has there been any progress on that?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate it falls between the Departments of Health, Finance and the Minister's own Department but there is an issue around international student insurance which continues to be a problem.

That point about the additional places is worth briefly commenting on.  This is a whole-of-Government effort, be it with the July stimulus, the last budget or now the additional places we got sanctioned by Government a few weeks ago.  The further and higher education sector in Ireland has never been larger.  Not only that, it has never been larger in areas where there are jobs for the future, be those around green skills or retrofitting and much of the work the Minister of State is leading on the apprenticeship agenda.  We are beginning to see the real benefit of the human capital initiative in expanding graduate places and undergraduate courses in things like science, engineering and the likes as well.  I acknowledge the huge amount of work and resources that went in there and thank in particular the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for working with us on that.  He, I and the Government as a whole see a real part of our economic recovery being founded in properly expanding the further education, training and higher education space.<\/p> <p>  On the Cassells issue, while we will not have time to get into it today I always have to mention one thing when people raise it.  The Senator did not do this but many people say it has been six years since the report was published and nothing has happened.  That of course would be 100% untrue because in the years since the Cassells report was published, funding to the higher education sector has increased by around &euro;500,000 or 40%.  I still believe, and of course I would, that it is not sustainably funded and it needs to be properly funded and we have much work to do on that.  It is important to say we are now funding higher education, exclusive of research, to the order of &euro;1.98 billion.  The Government has taken an approach in terms of loss income for all sectors of society that the Government does not cover loss of income.  Thus the Government supports have been directly related to Covid-related costs and I would be first to acknowledge that does leave other challenges for the higher education sector around some of what we might call commercial losses.  My Department is engaging intensively with the representative bodies to see how we monitor that first of all and then how we might be able to help in ways other than direct financial assistance from the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  I am very much aware of the the matter of students who have had non EMA-approved vaccines and have heard from institutions on this.  My Department, at official level, is engaging with officials in the Department of Health and we will be guided on thyat by a decision or policy direction from our public health officials and our Department of Health.  The issue has not progressed further, to the best of my knowledge.<\/p> <p>  On the insurance matter, I must admit I do not have the latest on it with me so I will reply to the committee and the Senator on that in writing, if that is okay.  I am very much aware of the issue and we have been working with the Departments of Justice and Finance to progress it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#K00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I appreciate the funding levels for higher education have increased but as he has pointed out himself, the numbers going into it have significantly increased as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to quickly raise a number of other issues.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's point around the change in design.  With our capital works, the matter of how we can improve ventilation is something we need to explore.  A concern has been flagged with capital works and it is one which applies across the economy, namely, the rising cost of building materials.  As we all know, this will impact on the sector.<\/p> <p>  Looking to life post-Covid, one of the things we have seen is a far greater use of technology.  As the workforce and everything is changing so quickly we will see a greater use of micro-credentials, upskilling and the Springboard programme will have to expand further.  It is something there must be a focus on from the innovation side of the Minister's Department to look at not just what skills are needed post-Covid but which ones will be needed in about ten years' time.  I suggest there be funding provided for research on this.  I am aware some work has been done by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the Irish Research Council, IRC, on the impact of Covid of society, which will be relevant.  We must ask what our learnings from this period are, both from a health point of view but also from a social one, on the impact of what has happened.<\/p> <p>  I have a final point of conern, on which the Minister may want to comment.  Research is always evidence-based and academics argue their cases on the basis of such research.  I am somewhat concerned about the case of an academic in a tenured position who encourages vaccine hesitancy and indeed has sought to undermine the public health advice of the Government, particularly given the position they occupy.  I am obviously not going to go into the individual circumstances of the case but I think there is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#K00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I am going to cut off the Senator there as I do not expect the Minister to answer that.

I refer to the importance of the vaccination programme and science research.  We have seen the great value derived from science and research in, literally, saving lives and allowing our country and world to reopen.  As a former Minister for Health, I witnessed the incredible endeavours of those working 24-7 to try to save lives.  It is an awful kick in the gut, to put it mildly, when we see some of this kind of carry-on.  I had better bite my tongue, though, beyond saying that much.  However, I do not disagree with what was said.<\/p> <p>  Turning to funding, we are going to have an exciting discussion about properly funding higher education.  The Taoiseach is up for it and he is prioritising this undertaking.  He wants to get this done and it is one of the reasons he set up this Department and his bona fides in this area are beyond reproach.  One aspect we must examine, though, is the staff-student ratio at third level.  We talk about it all the time at primary and secondary levels, but we have lost ground, to put it mildly, on the staff-student ratio at third level.  As part of a sustainable funding model, one of the things I wish to rectify is how we can get to a good, decent staff-student ratio at this level.  I put that down as a marker for a longer conversation that we will undoubtedly have about such a sustainable funding model.  It must not be just a case of us asking how much more money we are going to put into the system.  It is an important aspect, but also important, however, is what the country is going to get in respect of outputs and outcomes.  A proper and sustainable staff-student ratio is one metric we should examine.<\/p> <p>  The point about microcredentials is important.  Again, when we have the discussion about funding, it will go hand in hand with reform.  There will be three pots of funding.  One will be for what is required as core funding, accepting that there are deficits in that regard which must be addressed.  Then, there will be the funding to do new things and to allow us to have a flexible and agile system rather than allocating new money for old rope.  In that context, we must explore how we can ensure a 40-year old with three kids, a mortgage and a full-time job - which is the example I refer to frequently - who needs to access a module of higher education can do so in a flexible and agile way.  The third pot of money is concerned with how to support students, the provision of supports for those students and enabling access to and inclusion in third level education.  Those are going to be the three distinct areas which must be brought together and then knitted together.<\/p> <p>  Turning to skills, what was said is correct.  We will not have time to get into this aspect in detail now, but we are undertaking a massive body of work in my Department on skills infrastructure.  We have a lot of it in Ireland.  There is the National Skills Council, the labour market unit in SOLAS and the regional skills forums.  However, now that we have a dedicated Department with responsibility for skills, if I may call it that, the question is how we can get the most out of it for the country.  In the area of research, for example, we have published the general scheme of the proposed Bill relating to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and that is important.  However, and I flag this aspect for the first time at this committee, because I have not done so elsewhere, I also intend to introduce legislation and a research Bill in 2022.  While some things will be dealt with in the governance Bill for HEA, and they should be, I think the breadth of our ambition regarding what we want to do in the research sphere and the structures that we want to put in place to achieve such an outcome will merit a stand-alone research Act.  I look forward to working with the committee on that proposed legislation and I thought I should mention that point here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#L00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan has returned, so I call him now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#L00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for his patience.  I have finally sorted out my IT issues.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh said, many of the questions I was going to ask have been already posed.  I will address a few points.  I acknowledge the funding announced yesterday and it is a massive boost for this area.  Hopefully, it will allow for further reopening in time.  I also raise the issue of mental health supports, which are going to be partially funded from the moneys announced yesterday.  I ask the Minister if he can give us clarity on the specific targets for that allocated funding.  For example, will the money be directed towards additional emotional and therapeutic counsellors or will it be left up to each university to do what it chooses with its allocation?  I would like the Minister to clarify what those specific mental health supports will be.<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns antigen testing.  We have spoken about this aspect now for the best part of 18 months.  To be fair, and I have said this to the Minister before, he always has been consistent in his position that we should embrace antigen testing.  He stated that not in the context of antigen testing being a replacement for our overall policy in this area, but in respect of such testing having a specific role to play.  The Minister has been consistent in making that point.  He said in his opening statement that his Department had written to the Government's expert advisory group on rapid testing to request its early advice.  When is a response anticipated?  It is an important element in respect of preparations being made for the new term.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to vaccinations, a previous speaker mentioned that the online portal is now open to those aged 18 to 24 yeas old and an increasing number of adults will now be vaccinated ahead of the return to college.  I am always reluctant to ask former Ministers for Health about the current status of health affairs.  However, given Minister Harris's former role, what impact does he think the increasing number of students being vaccinated will have on the overall return to college in September?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#L00400","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for his three questions and those topics have been very much on my mind in the past 24 hours.  Starting with the mental health supports, I must concede that I am a little torn on this issue.  I want to do two things.  First, I want to give the individual institutions maximum discretion.  For example, if a really good idea is conceived in University College Cork, UCC, and the students and staff get together and devise a scenario regarding what they believe would happen if a certain approach was implemented, then I want to allow them the discretion and flexibility to come up with such local innovative ways to look after mental health and well-being.  Second, though, I want to ensure we do not just announce funding for mental health supports only for all of us to be asking what difference it has made in six or 12 months' time.  Since this funding was approved in the past 24 hours, therefore, I have been discussing its allocation with my officials.  We will, basically, allocate the money to the HEA and then that body will, in turn, apportion it to individual institutions.<\/p> <p>  Before that money leaves the HEA, I want to have a shared understanding regarding what we will view as a menu or metric of good outcomes from that spending.  For example, after talking a great deal to students, I feel strongly about increasing the number of hours of availability of access to student mental health counsellors.  I will put it like this, while we will not micro-manage this endeavour and we will allow the institutions the flexibility to get the best out of this funding by working with the student unions and, crucially, listening to the voices of students, we will also try to set out some parameters that will enable us to acquire an understanding of the outputs and outcomes of this funding allocation rather than just being aware that more money has been provided.  I will be happy to keep the committee updated on this and I will write to it regarding this matter probably next week, once I have concluded my deliberations.  <\/p> <p>  Moving on to antigen testing, I acknowledge the brilliance of the people working in our sector on this issue.  I refer to Professors Breda Smyth, Kingston Mills, Paddy Mallon and Mary Horgan.  I am sure that I have left out a load of names, but those are just some of the co-applicants for the pilot project which is now running in UCC, University College Dublin, UCD, the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, and Trinity College Dublin, TCD.  They have now become household names in respect of having provided expert advice throughout the pandemic.  Two are members of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and one is working on the front line in St. Vincent's University Hospital.  Therefore, these are people who really know what is going on when it comes to Covid-19.  <\/p> <p>  I acknowledge and praise my successor in the role of Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for setting up the expert advisory group in the Department of Health under the chairmanship of Professor Mary Horgan.  I think that group was established the week before last and we wrote to it then to say we would need its expert advice in the context of a situation where we might reach a decision point in respect of our pilot project demonstrating benefits in using rapid testing.  In that case, we might have to ask the expert group how we could best go about scaling up such an approach and how to undertake that endeavour.  In fairness to the group, we wrote to it only in recent days, so I am not suggesting it is being in any way tardy with its response.  However, I hope our request could be treated with a sense of urgency, given the level of importance the Government has attached to the reopening in the autumn.  Therefore, I am certain we will engage with the expert group in a collaborative fashion.<\/p> <p>  On the vaccination programme, I sometimes get criticised for commenting on my former Department while also being asked about it frequently.  I am delighted to see the acceleration of the vaccination programme.  Huge credit should be given to the Department of Health, the Minister and the HSE for getting us to a position where we can accelerate the vaccination programme.  However, let me be clear that being vaccinated is not a requirement to go to college in September.  On the other hand, the more people we have vaccinated, the better we will be able to get on top of this virus and live more safely.  Therefore, I have no doubt it will have a very positive impact.<\/p><p>I encourage students to get vaccinated, but I do not need to encourage them because there is great excitement and enthusiasm among students who want to get their lives back on track and to get vaccinated.  We have not seen the sort of hesitancy that has been seen in some countries.  <\/p><p> The next ask I have, and which I believe we all have, is to get the portal open as quickly as possible for 16 and 17-year-olds.  Many of them, particularly 17-year-olds, could well end up being college students.  We are also seeing a particular spike in cases among 16 and 17-year-olds and it would be great if we could see the portal open early in August for this age group.  It is my expectation that will happen.  To address Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, the mood music around the vaccine programme, the acceleration of it and the fact that if one is 18 one can now access a Covid-19 AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccine through a pharmacy is great news.  This should mean that we are on track to have the overwhelming majority of adults fully vaccinated in our country by the end of August. That has to be very helpful for the reopening of education in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#L00500","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Do I have time, Chairman, for one final question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#M00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#M00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the mental health supports and it is good that there would be some specification or descriptor going to the colleges rather than just a tranche of funding as this is important.<\/p> <p>  To finish on the issue of international students that was raised previously, many of these students coming into the country have missed out on the possibility of education here over the past while.  I have written a number of parliamentary questions in the past year and the latest response I received a number of weeks ago stated that the Minister did not have the exact enrolment figures for 2020 and 2021 but that those figures will be available later on this year.

We will revert to the committee in the month of August before the committee reconvenes.<\/p> <p>  On contingency planning, there is always planning of this type.  I am nervous even saying that because straightaway some people - not Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan - will misinterpret or suggest that we are not fully committed to getting people back safely.  We are.  The Taoiseach himself in his address to the nation said that he wants students back on college campuses.  We have deemed it essential and have ring-fenced &euro;105 million to make it happen and we have a public health endorsement for our plan.  There is always, however, contingency planning.  <\/p> <p>  The beauty of our framework this year is that it is not all or nothing.  It is not a question of whether everything or nothing can happen on site but is a question of a scale as to what can happen on site.  That is where the contingency plan really lies.  If it does not become possible to do some of the larger gatherings that one would wish to do in a lecture hall, perhaps that piece can then happen in a blended way but that does not mean the whole college will go off-line and it being a case of &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you next year&rdquo;.

In fairness, there has been a great amount of research and I commend all of the colleges that were involved in that.<\/p> <p>  What work has been done on CO2 and air filtration?  I met an air filtration company just yesterday and it showed me some of its equipment that can clean the air.  It mentioned that less than 20% of infections can be contracted by touching but with the new variant there is an 80% possibility of contracting it through the air.  What work has the Minister&rsquo;s Department done with the colleges on this issue and will all of the lecture halls have such filtration equipment in place by the time the colleges reopen?  <\/p> <p>  On contingency planning, and I do not want this point taken out of context in any way, but when one looks at the new variants that are coming through, including the Delta variant - hopefully there will not be any more of them - I am aware that planning is ongoing to be able to get ahead of any such variants that may be forthcoming.  Turning to the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, there is a serious backlog in apprenticeships training caused by the pandemic and the need to expand apprenticeship places.  I know the Minister of State has spoken about this in response to previous questions but on 8 May the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, referred to it as an emergency requiring national mobilisation to avert this crisis particularly in electrical, carpentry and plumbing apprenticeships.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, outline what measures are in place to avert the crisis to ensure this backlog can be cleared in as exponential a way as possible?  In addition, what plans are there to significantly increase the number of apprenticeships specifically in the electrical, carpentry, plumbing and construction areas?  Apprenticeships and their importance is an issue on which I hear a great deal on a regular basis from the construction industry.

Hopefully, we will have an outcome on our deliberations on that in the next week or so.<\/p> <p>  On variants, the Chairman is correct and as a former Minister for Health I am always acutely aware of Covid-19, the dangers of it, and the fact that this is a virus, as the T&aacute;naiste has said, which can often rubbish best-made plans.  I am very aware of all of that but I am also very aware that the vaccines work.  That is now the difference.  We have a very transmissible and contagious variant and we are seeing a very significant spike in cases in many countries and are likely to see a big increase here but we also know that if one is vaccinated, this vaccine provides one with very significant protection from this variant.  My optimistic note is built against the backdrop that every single week hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of people are being vaccinated and fully protected together with the expectation of where we will be by the end of August as to vaccine level, coupled then with the fact that we have a plan that is endorsed by public health and is operating on a scalable framework as to a minimum and maximum amount of on-site activity which we monitor very closely.  <\/p> <p>  In case I do not get the opportunity to make a further contribution, I must say to our stakeholders in the Irish University Association, IUA, THEA, the Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, SOLAS, the HEA, the Union of Students of Ireland, the trade union movement and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, the Teachers' Union of Ireland TUI, and AONTAS, that we are very lucky to have these stakeholders who are working so collaboratively.

That is a key action within the apprenticeship action plan.  On addressing the backlog, the answer I gave earlier is our position on that.  We are working with the training providers, the education and training boards, ETBs, the institutes of technology, and our technological universities.

Does the Minister of State, as a Limerick man, want to come in or would the Minister like to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#N00500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I join the Chair in expressing words of condolences and sympathies on the passing of the late Des O'Malley.  He was a little bit before my time.  I served with his daughter, former Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, in the Oireachtas during my first round in the D&aacute;il.  This is the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I note that the O&rsquo;Malleys were steeped in education.  The history of Des O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s late uncle, Donogh O'Malley, is well known by us all.  There is a broad family of O&rsquo;Malleys right across Limerick city and county.  They are steeped in community and in politics.  Interestingly, much of the media discussion has naturally centred on the establishment of the Progressive Democrats by Des O&rsquo;Malley and others.  Interestingly, not all of the O'Malley clan across Limerick followed Des O&rsquo;Malley and joined the Progressive Democrats.  Many of them stayed in Fianna F&aacute;il.  There was an extensive gathering of a few hundred of the O'Malley clan in Limerick recently, when times permitted, and that was one of the key features which was discussed by the extended clan.  Politics unites, but it also divides, as we know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#N00600","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072200002#N00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I will stay out of Limerick politics as I know better than to get involved.  I join the Chair, members of the committee and people across the Oireachtas in extending our sincere sympathies and condolences to the family of the late, great Des O'Malley.  Looking back at his career as a younger politician is quite overwhelming.  He confronted challenges with such courage.  During his tenure as Minister for Justice, he was just 31 years of age.  He and his family faced personal risks in a very different Ireland, thankfully, to the one we live in now.  People would always remember Des O&rsquo;Malley as a man of integrity, courage and principle, and as a man who made a real impact on political life.  He made a positive impact on the life and well-being of our country.  Our thoughts are with his daughter, former Senator Fiona O'Malley, who served in these Houses, with his son, Eoin, who contributes to public debate, and with all his family, former colleagues, and friends.

They are the obvious ones.  People are just too busy on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  I know that from my own experience in trying to pursue language courses.  We will look at that and try to come up with some suitable times for people.<\/p> <p>  On the captions ar an teilif&iacute;s, I undertook to do that at the last meeting.  We have installed the technology to facilitate the captioning.  The second stage of the process is the recruitment of interpreters.  We have two new interpreters starting in September.  They will be able to translate material on a dynamic basis, so that captions are up to date.  They will be working in the broadcasting unit.  The issue at present is a health and safety issue in the broadcasting unit because of the confined space there.  As soon as we get the green light from a health and safety point of view, we will be able to commence the captioning service.  I hope, if things go well in terms of the public health situation, we will be starting the captioning service in the autumn.<\/p> <p>  On the arrears of the Act, the Deputy had various questions, and perhaps I should talk in that context about the staffing numbers in rann&oacute;g an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  We currently have 25 people.  Three years ago, we had 24 people.  To illustrate the extent of the challenge, over the past three years, we have run eight separate competitions to recruit staff in rann&oacute;g an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  Our net increase after all of that effort was one person.  There is a big challenge in terms of recruiting people with the high standard of technical knowledge that can translate Acts.<\/p> <p>  We did our analysis of the Acts and we brought in PricewaterhouseCoopers, which I spoke about during my last appearance.  Based on the metrics PricewaterhouseCoopers collected, its estimate was that rann&oacute;g needed 39 people to keep up with the current workload and to tackle the arrears on hand.  We are well off that.  Three years in and eight recruitment competitions later, we are still 14 people or 50% off our targeted numbers in rann&oacute;g.<\/p> <p>  One of the big issues that is beginning to affect us is the establishment of the EU translation unit in Grange, County Meath.  That was really brought home to me when I looked at the figures.  Our entry grade is aistritheoir gr&aacute;d 3.  I rith Aibre&aacute;n 2018, we had 48 duine who applied for the roles that were available.  In our most recent competition for aistritheoir, we had seven people.  The difficulty we have at present is that we cannot match the terms and conditions of the EU institutions.  There are very attractive salary levels for people going to work in the EU institutions.  That is having a big impact on our recruitment.<\/p> <p>  What we have done is we have approached the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the salary scales.  This week, we got sanction to start people higher up on the scale.  What we can do is we can start them on the fifth point of the scale, which will be an increase of approximately &euro;10,000 in the starting salary for somebody coming in at aistritheoir gr&aacute;d 3.  It is hoped that will help alleviate the problem somewhat.  Going forward, the recruitment will be a big challenge for us.  There is nothing we can do around that in the short term.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the progress of the Acts, the first year and a half of rann&oacute;g 2024 was about putting in place the foundations for tackling the arrears difficulties.  We did significant analysis.  We put in place an administrative team in rann&oacute;g an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  We put in place the project management team.  We are now beginning to progress through the Acts.  We are doing it at a slower pace than any of us would have wished.  It will be a big challenge to reach the target we have set ourselves by 2024.  We have to look to see how the recruitment thing plays out.  If we can manage to recruit additional people by virtue of the higher salary rate, that will be an enormous assistance to us.  We will have a better idea of that in about a year's time when we go back out to the market with higher salary levels.  At that point it is possible to make a definitive assessment on how close we will come or how far off the 511 we will be, but it will be a big challenge.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021072200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Maidir leis an nGaeilge, an bhfeiceann Peter Finnegan pointe ag a mbeidh s&eacute; in ann idirghabh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh anseo tr&iacute; Ghaeilge?

I will start with the financial side of things.  I cannot give precise answers to the Deputy at the moment but I would hope to be able to do that on the next occasion that I appear before the committee because we intend to commission a comparative study of bilingualism.  I have long felt that if we are serious about having a bilingual Parliament, it has to be designed into our processes.  That is one of the difficulties that we had with Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin.  Our translation side was okay but the process side was a great challenge for us.  It took us 55 hours to process all of the amendments due simply to process issues.  If you have a bilingual parliament, you have worked out your processes and systems and can accommodate much more readily that type of thing.  One of the things we now have to do is to look at the likes of the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament, and look overseas to the Canadian Parliament and the Belgian Parliament and see how they operate bilingualism and use best practice from elsewhere to inform what we do within the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  On the SIPO question, to the best of my knowledge there is no requirement there and that is obviously a policy matter.  The rules regarding funding of political parties and the use of that funding are set out in legislation.  It would obviously be open to the Minister responsible to insert a provision to encourage greater use of Irish rather than any sort of a stick.  That is the approach I would take.

One of the ways as identified by the Senator is links to the third level institutions.  Building those relationships with the Irish departments in universities across the country is something that we will have to work on going forward.  Hopefully, those people will then come in on a short-term internships during the course of their studies.  They may like what they see within the Houses of the Oireachtas and may look favourably on the Houses as a possible career.<\/p> <p>  The second thing which Mr. U&iacute;bh Eachach touched upon during his earlier contribution is the opportunities that Covid-19 presents to us.  I always felt that one of the things that we should be exploring is the possibility of a regional office or offices for Irish because there is a pool of talent in Gaeltacht areas in particular parts of the country, whether that is in Galway, Kerry or Donegal, where we could recruit staff and who would be interested in working for the Oireachtas if they are able to stay in their local areas.<\/p> <p>  In a sense, we have moved now beyond that with Covid-19 which has given us the opportunity for people to work remotely and all of the policy in Government and in the public sector is to encourage remote working.  Going forward, that opens up very significant possibilities for us as an institution.<\/p> <p>  My concern originally with the regional offices was just to get a critical mass of people in one centre and I was thinking in terms of the office of an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in Spiddal where we might rent out some office space and there might be a critical mass there.  We do not need to do that now as we have the technology and can run Microsoft Teams meetings with staff members.

We are in a better position than we were a number of years ago in the usage of Irish in the Oireachtas.  We are on a journey that will take a considerable period of time, but the language scheme is very much about incremental improvements, which is what we are about.  There is no shortage of commitment on our part to the promotion of Irish within the Oireachtas, which we have tried to do over recent years.  The next stage in the process is to have a look at what comes back from the study we will be doing on bilingualism to see what we can take from that to advance the Oireachtas as a bilingual working environment.<\/p> <p>  I thank the joint committee also for the work it is doing.  One of the things it is doing for us is to push us, which is good.  We talked about targets earlier.  The joint committee itself has raised both expectations and the requirement for an Irish standard, which is to its great credit.  It is up to us now to try to deliver on that as a parliamentary service.<\/p> <p>  On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues, Mr. U&iacute;bh Eachach, Ms Gunn, Ms Crawley and other colleagues in the service, our commitment is to work with the joint committee over the coming years to develop the whole concept of bilingualism, to create an atmosphere in the Oireachtas where Irish is welcomed and where the love we all have for the language can be fostered, and to enable those of us who have lost our language skills to get them back, we hope, in the years ahead.

The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, welcomes the opportunity to participate in this committee's hearing on the subject of access to housing and accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation.  Since early 2020 FLAC has operated a dedicated Traveller legal service, supported by the Community Foundation for Ireland and in co-operation with a steering group of representatives from all of the national Traveller organisations.  The purpose of the Traveller legal service is to address and highlight the unmet legal need of the Traveller community, through legal representation and the provision of legal training and assistance to Traveller advocates.<\/p> <p>  Since its launch, the Traveller legal service has received more than 90 inquiries from Travellers and Traveller advocates requesting legal assistance.  To date, the Traveller legal service has formally represented Travellers, either through entry into or bringing proceedings, or preparing a case and issuing pre-action correspondence, in 20 instances.  While many of these cases involve the consideration of multiple areas of law, the majority concern housing law issues, such as the failure to provide Traveller-specific accommodation, inadequate standards in Traveller-specific accommodation, evictions and the failure to provide emergency accommodation.  FLAC&rsquo;s evidence to the committee is predicated on its experience of providing legal assistance to the Traveller community via the Traveller legal service.  It is our firm belief that equal access to justice, an unrealised ideal in the State, must form a core element of addressing the issues being considered by the committee today.<\/p> <p>  While there is no unitary definition of what the right of access to justice entails, its importance to societies governed by the rule of law is reflected in the recognition of aspects of the right under the Constitution and also international human rights instruments, such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Access to justice can be conceived of as a gateway right, meaning that it operates as a prerequisite to the fulfilment of other substantive rights.  Without the possibility of receiving access to legal information, early advice and representation, an individual&rsquo;s entitlements under the law are rendered illusory.  By way of salient example, it took a judgment of the High Court in the case of University of Limerick and Ryan to first recognise the State&rsquo;s statutory obligation to make provision for Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  It is well documented that the State is undergoing a multidimensional housing crisis.  One aspect of this crisis is the disproportionately high level of homelessness among Travellers.  A long-standing and related aspect is the failure of the State to deliver on its commitments as envisaged by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, which has resulted in a chronic under-supply of Traveller-specific accommodation.  In FLAC&rsquo;s experience, many of the issues faced by Travellers in relation to housing, such as challenging evictions, accessing emergency accommodation, or being provided with Traveller-specific accommodation, are justiciable issues.  That is to say, they are issues which require the input and expertise of legal professionals and, if necessary, the judgment of a court, to clarify and enforce entitlements and obligations.  Notably, FLAC&rsquo;s experience is in fact consistent with international research, which has found that vulnerable groups are more likely to suffer from justiciable problems.<\/p> <p>  As it is currently constituted, the State&rsquo;s scheme of civil legal aid does not explicitly extend to the provision of advice and-or representation in cases concerning housing and evictions.  Nor could the scheme respond in a sufficiently timely manner to evictions, which in some circumstances see Travellers provided with no notice or a period of 24 hours in which to vacate a site, on pain of potential prosecution and-or having his or her caravan impounded.  Civil legal aid is also currently unavailable to parties appearing before quasi-judicial tribunals such as the Workplace Relations Commission.  The import of this is that a Traveller who has been discriminated against in the provision of housing or access to Traveller-specific accommodation, an issue which has been very comprehensively highlighted by our co-attendees, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, that Traveller cannot access legal aid to litigate his or her claim with the benefit of advice and representation. <\/p> <p>  The remainder of FLAC&rsquo;s evidence addresses recommendations for the reform of housing legislation as it relates to Travellers.  However, it is our firm submission that any reform of substantive law must be accompanied by an expansion of the scheme of civil legal aid to unambiguously offer and provide advice and representation on matters related to housing, evictions and appearances before quasi-judicial tribunals.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to eviction legislation, a local authority wishing to evict a Traveller living on the roadside or an unofficial site has no fewer than five separate legislative mechanisms to do so.  Each of these mechanisms carries with it a risk of prosecution, of the Traveller having his or her caravan, that is to say his or her home, towed and-or impounded, and all but one may be invoked on short or no notice and without prior or subsequent recourse to a court or other independent authority.  In particular, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, commonly known as the criminal trespass legislation, the mere presence of a Traveller's caravan on local authority land without explicit permission constitutes an offence.  That is an offence for which the Traveller legal service&rsquo;s clients have in fact been prosecuted.  In contrast to that situation, a local authority wishing to evict someone from a dwelling which it owns, even where there is no legal basis or right for the person being there, must first apply to the District Court for a possession order.  The proceedings are on notice to the person against whom the order is sought and the order may only be granted by the court if it is satisfied that it is proportionate and reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  In FLAC&rsquo;s submission there is no justification for the disparity between the protections afforded to a squatter in a local authority dwelling and the absence of such protections for Travellers living on unauthorised sites.  Indeed, the European Committee of Social Rights has found that Ireland is in fact in breach of Article 16 of the Revised Social Charter for the continued use of certain of these provisions in the absence of adequate safeguards, such as the provision of legal aid, for those against whom the provisions are invoked.<\/p> <p>  FLAC has therefore recommended for the introduction of reforming legislation to ensure that, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, a family home can never be interfered with, and not until there has been a merits based determination involving a proportionality assessment by a court, and accompanied by a requirement to offer alternative appropriate accommodation to homeless families. <\/p> <p>  On the issue of Traveller-specific accommodation, in 2018 then Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, established an expert group to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation impacting on the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  The expert group&rsquo;s report was published in July 2019 and it concluded that the 1998 Act must be overhauled, its failings having been evidenced by an extremely high rate of Traveller homelessness, failures to meet the scale of accommodation needed by Travellers and an increase in those living in overcrowded conditions.  FLAC considers that the recommendations of the expert group must be implemented in full and without further delay.  In particular, FLAC considers it a serious flaw of the 1998 Act that councillors may adopt a programme for the provision of Traveller accommodation for a period of five years, which the local authority is legally bound to implement, yet vote against the delivery of components of that programme with impunity.  This pattern of voting for, and then against, Traveller accommodation, has been identified as a significant blockage to the delivery of Traveller accommodation by the Traveller legal service's clients, by the steering group which oversees the service, the expert group report and also independent research commissioned by the Housing Agency.<\/p> <p>  In circumstances where this committee&rsquo;s current module is examining the issue of access to Traveller-specific accommodation, it cannot ignore the evidence pointing to the actions of councillors in voting down plans for Traveller-specific accommodation as a significant obstacle to be addressed.  Accordingly, FLAC concurs with the recommendations of the expert group for the introduction of legislative provisions suspending the reserved function of councillors for the approval of proposals for Traveller accommodation, and also for the introduction of legislative provisions providing for an alternative and direct route for Traveller accommodation to be provided through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  <\/p> <p>  FLAC&rsquo;s evidence today has addressed a number of issues which are raised in its written submission.  These are the matters we wished to discuss in the time available to us today.<\/p><p>However, we would really encourage the committee to review and consider the written submission in full, which also refer to the issues of Garda vetting of social housing candidates; standards in Traveller accommodation; the application by local authorities of a local connection test; section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, commonly known as the public sector duty; and an expansion of the Equal Status Acts.

I am joined by commission member, Dr. Rosaleen McDonagh, and our head of legal, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Neill.  We are delighted to have this opportunity to appear before the committee so quickly after the publication last week of the accounts of our equality reviews into Traveller accommodation.  It is very important to us as a commission, which is directly accountable to the Oireachtas, to be able to come before members about these reviews, and the systemic issues that they identify.  This is the very first equality review of every local authority in the country.<br\/><br\/>Let me set out role of the commission and the statutory mandate which underpins these equality reviews.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is Ireland&rsquo;s independent national human rights institution and national equality body.  It was established and operates under the mandate of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  Section 32 of that Act gives us specific statutory powers to carry out equality reviews and to prepare equality action plans.  Equality reviews are a means for an organisation, in this case a local authority, to benchmark or audit its practices, here the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, against its obligations under the Equal Status Acts in order to assess whether the organisation, as a service provider, is fulfilling its statutory obligations to ensure equality of opportunity, and an absence of discrimination.<br\/><br\/>In exercising this legal power, in June 2019 we invited each of the State&rsquo;s 31 local authorities to conduct an audit of the level of equality of opportunity and discrimination that exists in relation to members of the Traveller community who wish to avail of Traveller-specific accommodation.  It related to the drawdown by the council of the Traveller-specific accommodation budget provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and to the council&rsquo;s obligations under the Equal Status Act.<br\/><br\/>Each council was also asked to conduct a review of its practices, procedures, and other relevant factors in this context, having regard to the Equal Status Act.  This is the first time the commission has used this equality review power to audit a public service which is provided in every local authority area.  We have chosen to do this to examine, in a more systematic way, the policy and practices governing Traveller accommodation provision around the country.  This work is complementary to the public sector equality and human rights duty, as Mr. McCann mentioned, which seeks to promote a more proactive cultural change in public bodies, a culture where human rights and equality implications of policy decisions and administrative processes are considered as a matter of course.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that for the commission, this work has been in addition to other continuing work on Traveller-related discrimination.  This work with, and for, Travellers comes under multiple strands of our mandate.  It has included the litigation of individual cases through the courts, bringing forward new research to inform and shape policymaking, and using other tools such as our annual grants programme, to support the capacity of local and national Traveller groups, particularly around access to justice.  As we appear today the commission has more than 100 Traveller clients on file with our legal team, across specific instances of challenging potential discrimination.  The vast majority of these cases are related to accommodation.<br\/><br\/>After two years of work and correspondence with local authorities, last Wednesday we published accounts of these equality reviews, alongside our annual report.  While this publication does not mark the end of this legal process, we considered it important at this key stage to inform people of the work done to date.  We particularly wanted to allow stakeholders, including local Traveller advocacy groups, to see, and to use in their own campaigning, our recommendations to each local authority.  In preparing for the publication of these equality review accounts, we held meetings with both of the national Traveller representative bodies, and separately myself and Mr. O'Neill held a briefing with almost 40 Traveller local representatives from across the country.  As members will have seen, we have done an individual report for each local authority.  Each of those reports contains its own individual recommendations from the commission. <br\/><br\/>What have we learned?  I will summarise some of the overarching findings which have emerged.  On the underspend in the drawdown of allocated funds, there is evidence that underspend is being driven by both structural issues in how funding is allocated and drawn down, but also by a frequently deficient process for identifying actual and future housing needs.  On evidence of poor information gathering to inform decision-making, there is evidence that the process for assessing the number of Travellers in a given local authority area varies from council to council, and that the process itself can be deficient in capturing accurate information.  On identifying Travellers' true accommodation preferences, that is, Traveller-specific accommodation versus social housing, is not adequately transparent, nor does it appear to have been independently verified over time.  We are concerned that a lack of Traveller-specific accommodation, or exasperation over the conditions in such accommodation, means that Travellers perceive that they have no choice but to apply for social housing.  We have also identified specific issues of concern regarding culture and identity, including a lack of analysis of Travellers&rsquo; perspective in the private rental market; little consideration of Travellers with disabilities; a need for staff training; and the fact that several councils set out indigenous requirements for Travellers to be able to avail of social housing supports and Traveller-specific accommodation.  We have identified the need for these local authorities to review this requirement to ensure that there is no discrimination when compared to the requirements on the wider community in access to social housing.<br\/><br\/>We were particularly concerned that in most of the equality reviews, there was little or no evidence of participation by the local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC, or of any consultation with local Travellers or Traveller organisations, to inform the equality review.  Similarly, while there was some evidence of good practice, in many local authority areas, Travellers had little participation or input in relation to the management of their sites.<br\/><br\/>This committee has heard extensively about the issues of systemic discrimination as it relates to Travellers and housing.  Our commission has also brought forward research with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, on discrimination and inequality in housing in Ireland, which demonstrates that Travellers are almost ten times more likely to report discrimination in access to housing; while Travellers represent less than 1% of the Irish population, they make up more than 9% of the homeless population; 39% of Traveller households live in overcrowded conditions compared with less than 6% of all households; 84% of Travellers living in caravan or mobile home accommodation reside in overcrowded conditions; and Travellers are exceptionally reliant on social housing, with just under half - 49% - being social renters.<br\/><br\/>Associated with accommodation problems are a broader set of indicators across healthcare, educational access and decent work which are impacted by the conditions in which we live, including that the life expectancy for male Travellers is 15 years lower than for the settled population and 11 years lower for females; 13.3% of Traveller females were educated to upper secondary or above compared with 69.1% of the settled population; and 80% of the Traveller population is unemployed.<br\/><br\/>This year the commission is running a public awareness campaign combatting racism, entitled, Because we&rsquo;re all human.  Means we&rsquo;re all equal.  One of the participants in this anti-racism campaign, Mr. Martin Beanz Warde, said something which resonates with how Travellers are so often demonised.  He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhen one of us does something wrong, we all do something wrong.  But when one of us does something good it&rsquo;s only one of us.  You are the exception to the rule. <\/blockquote> <p>We need to ask the question, is the Ireland we want to live in, one where racism is accepted?  While Travellers are a distinct ethnic group, we need to stop othering them but rather move to nurturing and valuing the distinct Traveller community and culture as a part of our shared national heritage and culture.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s provision of Traveller accommodation has drawn widespread international criticism, including from the UN, the Fundamental Rights Agency of the EU and the Council of Europe.  The last 12 months alone have been marked by regular and disturbing reports and testimony on Traveller accommodation by organisations and bodies, including the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office and the Irish Traveller Movement.  Our own legal casework over years has shown the appalling conditions in which Traveller families are forced to live.  We have worked with a family, including a newborn baby, sleeping in the family car for months, including over winter; families, including members recovering from surgery for serious illnesses, living for long periods on so-called &quot;temporary&quot; halting sites, wholly unsuitable for human habitation; and a family living in settled accommodation in seriously overcrowded conditions, including one child with a significant disability and complex medical needs.<\/p><p>These are just a sample of situations we see across the country.<\/p><p> Moving back to our work on these equality reviews specifically, a significant obstacle to overcome is the importance of cultural difference in the treatment of Travellers by the State in providing accommodation.  Next year, on 1 March, will mark five years since Ireland recognised Traveller ethnicity.  Today, these equality reviews show scant evidence of a full appreciation of the practical implications of cultural difference when providing services and engaging with the Traveller community.  Aspects of Traveller culture, such as ethnicity, nomadism, use of caravans and horsemanship, are not adequately provided for in accommodation plans.  The commission is clear now, as it was in 2017, that State recognition of Traveller ethnicity needs to be a catalyst for change in how we use resources on policies affecting Travellers.  It is essential for our human rights and equality obligations that the State acts to translate that recognition of ethnicity into real world and appropriate service provision by public bodies across Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank the committee again.

I am delighted to be here.  There is systemic and endemic racism towards Travellers and where there is racism, there is poverty.  Where there is poverty, there is disability, illness and long-term ill health.  My contribution comes from a lifetime of experiencing racism as a woman with a disability.  I have lived through nine evictions of our family and I have lived on four different sites, each of them known as temporary, despite us living on them as a family for over eight years in two or three of them.  On those sites, issues of maintenance, water access and toilet facilities were a constant worry.  There was a lack of refuse and postal services, along with lack of a combination of other services.  There was a constant threat of closure and eviction from those sites, which only exacerbated mental health challenges and threats to our physical well-being.<\/p> <p>  As a woman I know the gendered aspects not only of racism but its combination with other issues.  I have watched mothers, children and fathers trying to manage in very difficult circumstances.  Some mothers have had cancer, multiple sclerosis or other progressive and degenerative conditions.  Children have sound and vision impairments and there are young adults who are deaf and who find it extremely difficult to access services because their accommodation needs are not being met.  These are often the hidden stories behind Traveller accommodation issues.<\/p> <p>  I am very constrained about what I can say because, as the commissioner, Ms Gibney, points out, we are waiting for responses from 31 local authorities.  I will make a few comments, if that is okay.  There should be an overarching acknowledgement of racism in the matter of Traveller accommodation.  It is real and not imagined.  There is no use in using words like \"discrimination\", \"oppression\" or \"othering\" as they do not quite capture what has been happening over the past 30 years.<\/p> <p>  The make-up of local Traveller accommodation consultative committees needs to be subject to more transparency.  I know very well that organisations, both local and national, have played a part but there is also a mandate from within the community.  I am not sure what the criteria are for settled people or their organisations to get on those committees.  I ask for transparency in looking at who is on those committees, what their mandate is and where that comes from.<\/p> <p>  If the Chair indulges me for a couple of minutes more, I will speak about leadership.  Over my life in Traveller politics, I have seen the incredible work and uncompromising commitment from Traveller activists, including women and men, teenagers, older people and those of us in between.  When called upon, we have played our part and taken responsibility.  That was particularly evident in recent times with matters arising from Covid-19, with community health workers demonstrating tremendous commitment to the safety of our community, particularly children and those of us with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  This leadership always feels one-sided, however, and I call on local councillors, politicians and young, vibrant and dynamic settled people looking for a new and more equal relationship with Travellers to show leadership and try to make a new history.  This new history should mean an issue like Traveller accommodation should not hold us back in every other area of our lives.<\/p> <p>  My first input on Traveller accommodation was back in 1995 with a task force on the Traveller community.  I am really disappointed that nothing much has changed.  The make-up of committees may have changed.<\/p><p>Reports may have become more sophisticated in how they are written but one thing has not changed, that is, the lives and living conditions of my community, the Travelling community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rosaleen McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonagh for her input this morning.

All the talking has been done and we need action.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCann stated the Traveller legal service had received more than 90 inquiries from the Travelling community.  Were they received in a certain timespan, whether one year or ten years?  There seems to be a small number of people coming forward on such crucial issues.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCann also made a point about the expert group established by the Minister of State, Deputy English, and a few of the issues the group raised.  From the point of view of FLAC, will Mr. McCann highlight one or two key recommendations this committee could take up that might make an impact in cutting across the lack of action by local authorities in relation to Traveller-specific accommodation?  We have had much legislation and many reports and we have heard a lot of comments on human rights, yet as Dr. McDonagh, who made a submission to the task force in 1999, said, we are still where we were in 1999.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#E00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>In response to her first question, the 90 inquiries have been received since the launch of the legal service.  The service was formed in March of last year and formally launched in July.  As everyone will realise, that coincided with the onset of Covid.  It is difficult to say whether those 90 inquiries are representative of the number of inquiries that would be received in normal times or reflect the fact that people's minds were on other things.  The service we have available consists of one full-time solicitor, namely, me, and my managing solicitor, Ms Lucey, who probably has to help me more than she would like.  We are incapable of coping with the demand on issues for which we can see, on an initial analysis, have a legal solution.  The response to the Deputy's first question is that the 90 inquiries have been received since March of last year.  However, we must also take into account that we formally launched and announced the service only in July.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the second question, it would be difficult for me to gainsay the findings of the expert group.  This was a group of three members with a range of expertise which was specifically looking at why the 1998 Act was under-delivering on Traveller accommodation.  Two particular recommendations in that report, which I mentioned, could lead to a significant obstacle being removed insofar as the delivery of Traveller accommodation is concerned.  The first of those is to remove the mandate of local councillors when it comes to delivering Traveller-specific accommodation.  As I mentioned, under the 1998 Act, councillors need to adopt a programme of accommodation with their plans for the five-year period.  We have seen on more than one occasion councillors who voted in favour of a programme then refusing components of that programme.  I cannot speak to their reasons for doing that but it seems to be a patent inconsistency and hard to reconcile with councillors' obligations under the 1998 Act.<\/p> <p>  The corollary of that is the need for another way to deliver Traveller accommodation.  The recommendation of the expert group is that legislative provision should be made to allow a direct request for permission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Those two associated recommendations, to my mind, would remove a significant obstacle.  I stress, however, that the expert report is comprehensive and looks at the issues from every angle.  Our firm recommendation would be that every conclusion and recommendation of that report be implemented without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher McCann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Deputy Collins asked what the committee could do in terms of actions.

All local authorities now have until the end of August to come back to us with information on what they have done to address any issues that have been identified, and also anything they plan to do within a certain timeframe.  That will bring us to a position where we then consider any potential next steps that we might take.  Within that window, it is a good time for councillors who want to show leadership in this area and effect change, as well as staff in those local authorities, to do so.

There are two points.  The first is the lack of the use of ethnic equality identifiers.  The local authorities are still not using these in full.  This is evident in what Ms Gibney said earlier.  Those identifiers are important as they also allow Travellers to freely identify their ethnicity.  In recent years, we have seen other communities, such as the gay community, flourish and become part of Ireland's fabric of diversity.  There is still a stigma in terms of not wanting to have Travellers live in certain areas.  That does not only apply to social housing but also with regard to whether Traveller-specific sites are allowed to be built.<\/p> <p>  I mention how far we as a country have moved.  It does not really matter.  We have all sorts of legislative practices but the problem, specifically around accommodation, is the lack of implementation.<\/p><p>The evidence suggests that this is not happening.  I echo the Chair, Senator Flynn.  Other communities have had the social mobility to achieve, whether it is a leaving certificate, a new job or being able to move up to senior Civil Service level.  Our community has not had that.  One or two of us have.  That is not enough to implement change.  We do not have the social network within those environments for someone to open the door or lower the ramp to pull a Traveller up.  It is worrying that in 2021, we still have to deal with the old NIMBYism where people see Travellers and say not in our backyard, not in my cul-de-sac and not in my area.  How do we expect a cohort of Traveller children, including deaf and disabled children, to progress in education when they are living in cars, as Ms Gibney said?  People are shocked when they hear about people living in cars.  Those cars do not have toilets.  They are not caravans, mobile homes, camper vans or holiday places.  These are environments where there is no place to wash, to go to the toilet or to have something to eat.  People make out that there is a facade that somehow we have all moved on and that Ireland has moved on, since we have gay marriage or equality legislation.  We have not moved on.  Our community is still bound to the old Traveller accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rosaleen McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations.  As Dr. McDonagh said, there has been little change in the 20 years that I have been involved between being on the council in Dublin and being a Deputy.  While there have been some positive changes, on the ground, there is very little change.  Many of the same problems seem to crop up.  I am curious what effect Covid has had for FLAC.  Has it thrown up more challenges in dealing with different issues?  An example of what I am talking about is the Gavin family on Ratoath Road.  There are 15 members of the family and there is an issue with water being cut off.  They are getting tankers but have no direct water, which is a disgrace and should not be allowed.  Fingal County Council said there is a legal issue with the land which has to be sorted out before it will put running water in.  It was originally there but was cut off for a particular reason.  Issues such as the redevelopment of St. Margaret's in Ballymun come to me.  I have been going to meetings about that for more than ten years.  Nothing has changed with the accommodation or the number of people looking for it.  In many cases, they are forced to look outside their community and for the housing assistance payment or otherwise.  It is a disaster to be pulled out of their own community.  That has torn the community apart over the years, with people being pushed out due to issues relating to rent supplement or otherwise and accommodation not being provided.<\/p> <p>  The equality review is important.  There is no doubt that Sinn F&eacute;in councillors will engage with that and have good input.  We passionately agree that it needs to be ramped up and pushed as much as possible.  The discrimination and issues that develop in different communities are frustrating.  I still see much of the discrimination that was also happening 20 years ago.  We must have people pushing and making sure that we address this so that this is not allowed to continue.  How much information does the Traveller community have with regard to FLAC and other bodies?  Apart from Pavee Point and such organisations, is the community aware that FLAC exists?  Is the community aware of the equality review?  I am sure people should have input into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#F00200","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The question about the level of knowledge of the Traveller legal service among the wider community would be difficult for me to answer, not being a member of the community and not being on the ground.  I emphasise that when the Traveller legal service was established, the premise adopted for how it would work was that we would seek to bring strategic litigation.  That is to say that we would seek to bring litigation where the result could potentially be a judgment to enforce or clarify a law or something of that nature.  The result can then be used by the wider community or relied on later.  The reason for setting the service up in that way is that it is a small service.  If we are to be a service for the whole Traveller community, which it is in a certain sense, subject to the need to bring strategic litigation, we would not be able to cope.  That is why, in our opening statement and evidence, we have really emphasised the need for reform of civil legal aid.  There is a clear amount of unmet legal need but it is at a level which our service could never address alone.  In our view, the only entity capable of doing so is the State.

I am talking about putting systems in place and about local authorities writing down what their basic expectations are, how the system works and what people can expect from the system and then implementing that.  We accept that in the case of egregious breaches, we will have to continue to deliver legal services, just as FLAC and other legal organisations do.  However, beyond that, there are ways to support people, including people within local authorities who are really committed to this area, to look at this through more of an equality lens and to promote the vindication of people's rights even on the basis of the legislation as it currently exists.

To be quite honest, we have a great amount of reports, committees and commissions of investigation but, looking at it through the lens of the people from the Traveller community for whom I work and whom I represent, there has been very little in the nature of implementation or of real change with regard to accessing basic services without difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I totally agree with Mr. McCann about the issue of Part 8.  There is another issue involved, which is the refusal of local authorities, in many cases, to transfer land to the likes of Cena.  That requires the council itself, by which I mean the members, to make a decision.  It is a major barrier to spending money, to getting things done and to progress.  It is not something we should shirk away from.  I was interested in the proposal, because I have been proposing the same thing for a long time, that these should go straight to the board.  Let those who have an objection object, but the board should make a decision in line with national policy, which has been clearly outlined here time and again by Government but which is not being followed by the local authorities.  When I say that, I mean the actual local authorities because, while there are obviously differences between individuals, in many cases I find that social workers and officials are very sympathetic to the Traveller community.  That is not true of all of them, but it is of very many.  There is a major structural problem arising from having to go through Part 8.<\/p> <p>  That leads me on to the set of 31 reports which have been carried out by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I was looking at the one in respect of County Galway.  My specific question is: are these the final recommendations or are we to get a final report?  Many of the recommendations are what I would call soft recommendations, by which I mean that you can do the things recommended while not fundamentally changing anything, such as Part 8, on the ground.  I have a major issue.  I am delighted that the number one recommendation related to the issuance of caravan loans.  That is a major challenge at the moment.  It is not happening and people are living in freezing conditions in inadequate caravans because that scheme is not working.  I have a case with the Ombudsman on behalf of a constituent in this regard.  We are pressing to get an answer but have not yet got one.<\/p> <p>  Looking further through the report, I do not see the council or the commission's recommendations addressing this Part 8 issue.  There is a further complication in Galway but I will discuss the Part 8 issue now.  It is a major issue and has held up vital housing for Travellers.  Settled people were also affected but I was dealing specifically with Travellers who were lined up for these houses, which were held up as a result of Part 8.  In some cases, children with severe disabilities were also involved.  It is not humane and it is not fair.  It is wrong.  Will the commission be making recommendations on this again and, going back to what Dr. McDonagh said, will they be a little more focused on getting action, implementation and change, whether certain people with certain powers want it or not?<\/p><p>I admire the work of FLAC, which is very important, but I fully agree with what Mr. O'Neill said.  People should not have to go to the law to get a house from a public authority.  It is wrong, immoral and cruel.  It is also far too slow.  If people with resources are fighting you, they are always at a big advantage.  They are also more skilled at it.  I know FLAC will do everything it can but at the end of the day, nobody - more importantly, no community because that is what we are talking about here - should have to go again and again to the law to get fundamental rights vindicated.  <br\/><br\/>Going back to the IHREC witnesses, I have no doubt they will have seen the book, <i>Pluralism and Diversity in Ireland<\/i>, by Fr. M&iacute;che&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il.  The last edition was published in 2011.  Fr. Mac Gr&eacute;il has been tracking this issue for 30 years.  It is worth citing the report to show the witnesses from IHREC what it is up against as an equality authority.  According to the report, 9% of settled people will accept kinship with a Traveller, 13.8% will accept friendship with a Traveller, 8.3% will accept a Traveller living next door to them, 8% will accept a Traveller as a co-worker, 18% believe that Travellers should not have citizenship and 9% believe they should be deported.  This is scary stuff and dealing with that level of prejudice against Travellers must be a major challenge to IHREC.<br\/><br\/>This chapter of the book, which is sizeable, shows how deep this problem is in our society and the challenge faced by IHREC in vindicating the equal rights of the Traveller community within our society.  That is manifest in so many ways every day of the week.  I would be interested in hearing the response of the witnesses from IHREC regarding the challenge generally.  I applaud what IHREC has done with local authorities and I look forward to getting the final report.  I hope it does not pull any punches because there has been a total failure by local authorities to fulfil their statutory obligation, namely, provide housing of its choice to the Traveller community.  When I say of its choice, I mean choice by type.  We have a major challenge here and I am interested in hearing the response of the witnesses from the IHREC.  <br\/><br\/>Dr. McDonagh hit the nail on the head.  We have all the reports we want.  The shelves are full of them but we are not actually getting that much change.  The only place where Fr. Mac Gr&eacute;il noted there had been change was in south County Dublin where there was a proactive city manager a number of years ago.  During his period of office, there was a measurable improvement in the indices, not only of housing but, funnily enough, of community relationships.  This was picked up when Fr. Mac Gr&eacute;il carried out the surveys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#G00500","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The recommendations we put forward at this stage are the final ones of the equality reviews.

We will then consider any further action we might choose to engage in.  The natural follow on is the equality action plans, which are another part of that legislation.  In the past, when we engaged with equality reviews and have not seen a terribly positive response to those recommendations, we followed up with an equality action plan whereby we can bind people towards firmer recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Across the rest of our mandate, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we continue to work on Traveller-related issues such as Traveller discrimination issues, a large part of which involves accommodation.

What we are really talking about in the context of the equality review is asking local authorities to benchmark themselves against their existing equality obligations and how they might improve the situation in that context.

If those recommendations were implemented, the Part 8 issue would be resolved and it may not be necessary to do further work on the issue.<\/p> <p>  The other point that was raised was around the role of litigation, where it comes in and whether Travellers should be required to go to a lawyer in order to get access to things as basic as sanitary services or accommodation.  While it is true they should not have to do so, Travellers come to us in numbers for these issues.  We would emphasise that until the political class takes up the cudgels and finally resolves this issue, individual Travellers should have access to lawyers to take their case to the courts, as in any other system.  If there is a systems failure, if legislation is not being implemented and if the Part 8 procedure becomes the victim of discrimination, that can be resolved through the courts.  Then again, I do not see why it is inimical to the resolution of the more structural issues to have that balanced with individual Travellers having access to appropriate and expert legal services.  Let them take their issue to the court and have their say there.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of doing that for individual Travellers.

The hierarchy of procedures, which would normally involve making an application, getting refused, taking a review, appealing, going to the Ombudsman and then going to the courts, is a hell of a hierarchy for anybody to jump.

It is much easier for those with many resources to jump that than it is for those with few resources.<\/p> <p>  I can tell Ms Lucey from dealing with Travellers on the ground, no more than dealing with ordinary people, such as small farmers and many other people I deal with, that they are intimidated by having to go through that process and that a lot of them will baulk at doing it.

This is something I have been talking to the Chair of the Joint Committee on Justice about and it is one we need to take up in that committee.  Civil legal aid is not fit for purpose.  In a recent Supreme Court challenge on the Workplace Relations Commission, the Supreme Court ruled that the Workplace Relations Commission is administering justice in a limited way.  It is allowed to do so under Article 37 but it is still administering justice and we need to expect the same standards of it as we would in any other aspect of the administration of justice.<\/p><p>These include ability to cross-examine, evidence under oath, transparency and all of these kinds of things.  Is there a chance there for some strategic litigation on expanding civil legal aid, particularly given that the courts have been clear that part of the effective administration of justice is a right to access legal aid?  If we are saying that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and all of these other quasi-judicial bodies should administer justice to the same quality, is there scope there?  Perhaps this falls into what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said in that it may take three or four years but I would certainly be interested in FLAC's insight into that as a way to develop civil legal aid to help in these sorts of cases as well as in a more general sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#J01000","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>As that question is directed towards the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, I will pick up on that point, which is a very interesting one.  There has been case law over the years on access to legal aid and whether it is a constitutional right.  While the courts have always affirmed that everyone has a right of access to the courts, it has been less consistent around whether that imports a right to legal aid.  However, there is a further point here because one is talking about the Zalewski decision and our equality legislation is based on EU law.  There is a provision under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union that would in certain circumstances suggest that where one is seeking to vindicate one&rsquo;s rights under EU law, the State may be under an obligation to provide one with legal aid if there is a phraseology around whether access to justice or something in that regard requires it.<\/p> <p>  There is a question mark over whether the blanket exclusion of legal aid in claims of discrimination going to the WRC, as this is understood, in particular, in terms of the Zalewski decision, and whether we are in compliance with EU law and whether legal aid has to be available in respect of those claims, at least in terms of somebody being able to apply, whatever the merits decision on that may be.

I have read through some of the reports, in particular in respect of Galway where I am based.  There has been a clear failure in Galway, which I have called out over a number of years, to not even have the consultative forum sitting.  Sometimes we are over-generous in saying that there is a failure of process.  All of the groups said that this is predominantly an issue of racism, pure and simple.<\/p> <p>  Even if one is to look at something like the social housing list in Galway, of the 588 Traveller families, 250 of those are on the social housing waiting list.  I am not going to say that Galway City Council is racist in putting social housing in place.  That is a process issue.  It is clear, however, that in making those applications, it is local people who are demonstrating a \"not in my backyard\" approach.<\/p> <p>  Ms Lucey touched on the gender pay gap legislation, which we recently passed and which now gives specific powers to FLAC.  I, as a solicitor, have volunteered for that organisation.  It is very difficult for individuals to go through the big rigmarole of having their rights vindicated.  That is difficult for all of us but it is particularly difficult for those who are disadvantaged and are experiencing institutional racism and a set-up within local authorities where it is stated that it is not racism but is process where we are waiting for housing.  How does one decode that to say which is racism and which is not because it is fundamentally down to the experience of the individual?  Do our witnesses believe that there is room for more legislation that would give FLAC and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, an ability to take cases on this issue?<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of housing, we are now expanding the amount of housing that we can have under Part V so that it will be stepped up to 20%, comprising 10% social housing and 10% affordable or cost-rental housing.  A big legacy from this Government is to step up from that.  Is there an opportunity there under Part V or under something else where one could have ring-fenced funding around those who are experiencing that level of racism where it is difficult to get the housing over the line.  I note the way that the legislation is devised at the moment where it is councillors who adopt these programmes for Traveller accommodation and yet it is also councillors who can object to specific housing plans.  Locals can object to other types of housing.  I am not saying that everybody is objecting out of hand but we all know and recognise that there is a racism issue there and we have to find structural ways around that.<\/p> <p>  These are some ideas that I have and I wonder what the thoughts of our witnesses are in order for us to put the structures in place to stop the racism from taking over and preventing the Government from moving forward with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#K00800","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Stanton.

That was a major step and I remember the night in the D&aacute;il when everybody stood up and applauded.  It was seen as a big step forward and we can still build on that.  We should all take serious note of what my friend and colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said.  I have been of the view for some time that we have been skirting around the real issue of prejudice.  I want to link that to what Mr. McCann said in his opening statement about councillors voting with impunity against the delivery of components of the programme.  The vast majority of councillors from all sides, all parties and none, put themselves forward and want to serve their communities and the vast majority come under terrible pressure from constituents about this issue.  That goes back to what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said earlier and the figures he gave.  Has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission ever considered interviewing councillors on an anonymous basis?  It could sit down with them and ask what is going on, what kind of pressures they are under, what they are experiencing, what is happening and why.  We have to get to the nub of this.  I am always a bit concerned when we have to go through litigation and the legal process, or even go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, because that is ignoring the elephant in the room that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v so rightly identified.  Dr. McDonagh identified that as well.  It is good to see her again.  This is very basic and it goes very deep.  We can move around with all the litigation and the courts at that level and we can get so far but we need to go much deeper.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is probably the best body in the country to research that, to go deep into society and see what is going on.<\/p> <p>  I note that the departmental guidelines were changed in 2013 and applications on the basis of need were recategorised.  Travellers were removed as a basis of need category and households were reassigned under alternative criteria such as homelessness, medical issues, being elderly, overcrowding, etc.  Has that had any impact on the provision of housing?  I also note an interesting report from the Housing Agency in 2014 on why Travellers leave Traveller-specific accommodation.  That makes some very interesting points as well.  In the UK there is Traveller-specific accommodation in many of the boroughs and it is well put together and well provided for.  Here, even though we have criteria and guidelines for accommodating transient Traveller families, issued by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, those guidelines do not seem to be followed anywhere.  We need to go far deeper into our society and find out what exactly is driving this prejudice that Dr. McDonagh identified so well earlier.  I thank our guests for the work they are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#L00100","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. McDonagh and then Ms Gibney to come in in response to Deputy Stanton and Senator Pauline O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#L00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>This may be my last opportunity to speak so I want to say that, woman to woman and Traveller to Traveller, I am delighted to see the Chair here.

As a human rights commissioner I would also bring in the broader issue of racism towards people living in direct provision or people who are homeless.

Senator Pauline O'Reilly is right that it is a balance of process as well as systemic and cultural issues within these institutions.  Both those issues must be addressed not just within local authorities but across public sector bodies.  As regards changing legislation, if the legislation is not working it should be looked at, reviewed and changed or new legislation should be introduced.  However, the focus for us today is on these equality reviews.  As Mr. O'Neill outlined, changes can be made within the existing system that will affect people's lives and that is what we would like to see happen from these equality reviews.  We should bring it through as far as we can with this particular exercise and build on that, and on all the other fronts we mentioned, in how we engage on this issue.  That relates to Deputy Stanton's question as well.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of interviewing councillors, this process is an ideal opportunity for councillors to engage with us if they wish to, and some of them have done that through social media and responded to some of our outreach on this issue.  We are open for business in terms of engaging with people and helping them to understand.  Between the recommendations of the expert review group and the local level recommendations we are giving, it has never been easier for leaders within these organisations, both councillors and staff, to effect change.  We will be happy to do that.  We also engage in broader work on attitudes and racism, which needs to be done.  As I mentioned, we ran a campaign this year called Because we&rsquo;re all human.  Means we&rsquo;re all equal.  We will continue to run that campaign and engage with the general public on racism and attitudes towards race.  This is ongoing work that we will continue to do.

The process alone will never solve the problem but what we have seen through our equality reviews is that, while enhancing the process will not necessarily resolve everything, it would improve the situation with regard to a number of issues.  I am in no way disregarding the nature of the challenge that Part 8 poses but the other thing we have seen within the equality reviews when going through 31 local authorities nationwide is that even in circumstances where there has been approval for planning there are still barriers beyond that.  Therefore, we need a multilayered approach to this.  It goes from politicians at a national legislative level down to people on the ground.  The other thing that struck us as we were going through the equality reviews is that there were examples of good practice on the ground with some individual people working within the system but it would appear, because we did not see paperwork to back it up, that that was largely based on the efforts, goodwill and initiatives of those individuals.  Part of what an equality review does is encourage that good practice to become embedded within the system.  That way, if that individual moves on or a new department is realigned or moved around, that practice is still part of the system and those who engage with the system will have a reasonable expectation and understand what they are entitled to.  We do not think equality reviews will solve all the problems because this is such a big challenge but we believe that, within the existing system, the process can improve the situation, at least to some degree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Would Ms Lucey like to come in briefly in response to Senator O'Reilly and Deputy Stanton?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#L00700","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I welcome the comments of Senator O'Reilly and Deputy Stanton.  One of our other experiences is that there is very little consistency and transparency about housing lists and priority from local authority to local authority.  As I understand it from working in the area, most of the Dublin local authorities have a numerical system whereby people know where they are on the list, and that they are number 20 or 25, for example.  Most of the local authorities outside Dublin do not have a numerical system so people have no idea where they are on the list compared to others.<\/p><p>When there is that lack of transparency it is very hard to know whether there is an element of racism seeping into the housing list.  Deputy Stanton also picked up on the fact of the deoprioritisation, almost, of Travellers in that they lost being a Traveller, in and of itself, as a ground for priority.  In a way, that totally neglects the circumstances in which most Travellers will be living when they do apply for housing and the huge disadvantage they face in accessing the private housing market because it is not immune from racism either.  Thus Travellers will be at a double disadvantage but get no priority now on the housing list.  They are really good points to pick up on.<\/p><p> Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised a point on Part V funding.  I am not sure I understand that enough to comment but the State does provide ring-fenced funding for Traveller accommodation and it does not get drawn down so any other ring-fencing would have to get around that same issue.  Hopefully the changes around Part V will bring some benefit to Travellers but it is unlikely to confer anything over and above what anybody else gets or to address the systemic issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I will just bang out a couple of questions quickly here.  Our guests may bear with me and whichever of them wishes should feel free to answer them.  We have had numerous witnesses before us and submissions to us.  The first question I ask of all of them is whether they think a national body should be established solely to look after Traveller accommodation.  We have also had numerous submissions where people spoke about looking at an ethnic identifier to determine housing needs down the line.  I want an opinion on that.  Do our guests think that should be in the hands of the local authorities themselves or should it be national?  Is it something for which we could be legislating?<\/p> <p>  Another point, touched on by Ms Gibney, is that while we have been discussing local authorities, the private sector is a big issue.  We have seen that Travellers are 22 times more likely to be discriminated against when it comes to the private sector itself.  What must we do to address that?<\/p> <p>  The FLAC members spoke about the numerous mechanisms Travellers face when it comes to evictions from the unofficial sites.  Will they elaborate on those other mechanisms, what they would like to see as a fairer solution and what we must do to address that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#M00200","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mitchell.  I am happy to take the question on evictions.  In our fuller written submission we outlined the five different legislative mechanisms I was talking about.  These are section 19(1)(c) of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, the Roads Act 1993, the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948.  Any of those can be used against a Traveller on the roadside and, as we pointed out, most of them can be used without needing to give any sort of notice or only 24 hours' notice.  Consequences then flow from not abiding by whatever order or direction has been given, which can include prosecution or seizure of a caravan and the caravan being impounded.  Our recommendations are quite clear.  We think section 19(1)(c) of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 is particularly egregious and constitutionally suspect and we have recommended it be repealed.  Our recommendation in respect of the remaining legislative mechanisms is that these should not be used in a way that does not give the person against whom they are being invoked the opportunity to receive legal advice and for the operation of the particular direction or order to have been reviewed by an independent tribunal, such as a court.<\/p> <p>  On the other questions, the Deputy asked how we can address discrimination in the private sector.  As she said, Travellers are 22 times more likely to be discriminated against.  There is law preventing it.  The equal status Act prevents discrimination on the grounds of membership of the Traveller community.  I reiterate our recommendation that extending the scheme of civil legal aid to cover quasi-judicial tribunals such as the Workplace Relations Commission would certainly assist a Traveller who has suffered discrimination to access legal representation and advice to challenge that discrimination.  Others may wish to come in on the remaining questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher McCann"},{"type":"speech","time":1626908400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>While Mr McCann is speaking, has he got any final comments for the committee?

In relation to the ethnic identifier, we understand the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is bringing forward that through the programme board to do with the expert group.  To our mind that does not require legislative change but a change to the application forms with all the necessary GDPR protections around it.  We would welcome an early resolution of that matter and understand it is moving forward.  It should be done while preserving really clearly the very specific reason this information is being collected and preserving the privacy of the individuals beyond that.<\/p> <p>  On the private sector, as Mr. McCann said, there is the recourse to the WRC and we have taken cases of this nature.  The other part that belies is that oftentimes our experience, certainly from the equality reviews, is that individuals from the Traveller community are looking at the private rental sector because they do not have another realistic immediate choice.  Thus, even if an individual succeeds in getting a tenancy from the private sector it will not necessarily be culturally appropriate.  All the other aspects like the size of the property, the ability to live close to family or the prospect of having some space to maintain other aspects of their cultural heritage simply are not realistic in that context.  There is a bigger issue in this context, which comes back to the original point Ms Gibney was making, which is that it is about the true preference.  Oftentimes, even where an individual from the Traveller community secures private rented accommodation it is not the real solution to the problem at hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021072200002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626908400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I will jump in quickly to cover one question Deputy Mitchell had and then hand over to Dr. McDonagh.

I have attempted to bring three such cases.  I brought one of them to court and the judge stated I did not look like a Traveller and, therefore, my human rights and equality rights were not breached and I was not given access to the pub because I just basically was not.  I refer to the issue of power.  A significant amount of work needs to be done on legal aspects.  I tried to bring a case against a local authority.  My father was dying of cancer and I sought services in the context of the Traveller sector.  It did not work.  This discussion brings me back to those parts of my life.  It is so difficult for members of the Traveller community to take these cases forward.  It is about accommodation.  Dr. McDonagh rightly stated it is about water and suitable and appropriate houses and trailers for members of the Traveller community.  A significant amount of work needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  I really hope that, with the publication of No End in Site and the recent work of IHREC, the work that is needed will get under way.
