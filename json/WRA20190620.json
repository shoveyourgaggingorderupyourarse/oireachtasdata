PMDS allows us to strategically align performance management and learning &amp;amp; development to facilitate the matching of skills, expertise and experience to roles.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of Action 9 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan 2014, to establish a new shared model for delivering learning and development in the Civil Service, OneLearning the Civil Service Learning and Development Centre was established in September 2017. OneLearning, which is based in my Department, will enable Civil Servants regardless of their organisation or location access to training and development opportunities and are responsible for all training that is common across the Civil Service. \u00a0To date there have been over 20,000 attendances at a OneLearning course session from 44 Civil Service Bodies across 25 counties. A new Learning Management System, will be rolled out across the Civil Service in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  OneLearning will continue to work with Civil Service Bodies to identify current and future learning and development requirements and develop appropriate learning solutions to equip civil servants at all levels with the knowledge and skills required to discharge their roles. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Civil Service Bodies continue to meet the unique learning and development requirements within their own organisations in relation to individual process obligations and challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":37,"content":"<p>Question No. 25 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":38,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[25683\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the estimated cost of preparing for Brexit, in particular for a hard Brexit, in 2018 and to date in 2019; if he anticipates additional resources to be required should a hard Brexit materialise in October 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published at the end of last year and updated at the end of January, sets out the comprehensive, cross-Government preparations for Brexit.\u00a0 All Departments have sector-specific plans in place identifying key challenges associated with Brexit and associated mitigation approaches.\u00a0 We have also taken important steps to prepare our economy, including the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, our Trade and Investment Strategy and Project Ireland 2040, while dedicated measures to prepare for Brexit were announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 was prepared based on the &ldquo;central scenario&rdquo; that the UK will make an orderly exit from the EU. In aggregate, a gross voted allocation of &euro;66.6bn is provided across all Government Departments. This includes additional expenditure of approximately &euro;115m specifically related to Brexit and follows the dedicated measures to prepare for Brexit announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018. This funding will enable the implementation of necessary measures including in the areas of customs and food safety controls.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a &euro;300 million Future Growth Loan Scheme is targeted at providing a longer-term facility to support strategic capital investment by business at competitive rates in a post-Brexit environment. With a further view to the impact Brexit will have on the business sector, supports were also provided to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to expand its Departmental and regulatory agency capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding was also provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine and its agencies to further strengthen the agriculture sector&rsquo;s ability to become more resilient in addressing the challenges of Brexit.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the OPW has spent in the region of &euro;15.6 million\u00a0to date on acquiring and developing physical infrastructure for use at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport as a consequence of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit upon the economy and the public finances continues to remain uncertain given that the timing and nature of the UK&rsquo;s exit remains unclear. Indeed, given this uncertainty, it became necessary to take action to prepare for a potential no-deal exit at end March. This included, the recruitment of additional staff by the Revenue Commissioners, with over 400 staff appointed over the period September 2018 to 12 April 2019. <\/p>  <p>  With uncertainty remaining the Government must continue to plan for the contingency of a disorderly exit. In this context spending plans will be kept under review to identify the potential resources required to deal with the impact of such a scenario this year. This uncertainty will also have implications for Budget 2020. While the SPU maintained an orderly Brexit as the central scenario, a greater likelihood is now being assigned to a no-deal or disorderly Brexit outcome. In this event, it is imperative that the automatic stabilisers are allowed to operate freely. This would include potentially higher social welfare spend as a result of increased unemployment or reduced tax revenue as a result of weaker employment. Further to this, the Government will also provide targeted, temporary, and effective support to the hardest hit sectors of the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Expenditure","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[25834\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on the assessment of his Department of the national broadband plan, the credibility of its cost-benefit analysis and its value for money to the taxpayer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>I value the independent and strong advice of the officials in both of my Departments. It is for this reason that the advice provided by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the National Broadband Plan\u00a0was made public on 8 May 2019.<\/p>  <p>  However, on this occasion, I formed a different view to that of my Department. As I have previously stated, this is for two main reasons. Firstly, there are an array of benefits not captured in the Cost Benefit Analysis, with immense value for citizens and the economy in the future. Secondly, having looked at the other options provided, none would deliver against the objective of achieving 100% coverage while guaranteeing lower cost.<\/p>  <p>  Rolling out a form of technology like this across the country is an inherently complex activity and therefore one which must involve risk. While I accept that there is complexity and risk involved in the decision taken by Government, I believe that on balance, the National Broadband Plan will provide value for money.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the question of the\u00a0Cost Benefit Analysis, the Public Spending Code requires that Sponsoring Agencies prepare an economic appraisal such as a cost benefit analysis or a cost effectiveness analysis for projects with an estimated cost in excess of &euro;20 million before the relevant Sanctioning Authority makes a decision on whether to approve the project. The Public Spending Code further requires that this project appraisal is continually updated as the procurement process evolves and as actual tender costs (as opposed to cost estimates) become available.  Responsibility for complying with all of the requirements of the Public Spending Code is a matter for each Sponsoring Agency and Sanctioning Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the National Broadband Plan, the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment has\u00a0conducted a\u00a0cost benefit analysis\u00a0and updated it on a number of occasions.\u00a0 Taking account of that\u00a0analysis and  the cascade of further future benefits that I believe will flow from the project, I am convinced that the project is justified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[25825\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000051#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to promote heritage sites under the auspices of the Office of Public Works;

the Gaeltacht, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Local Authorities.<\/p><p>The OPW uses a number of methods currently to provide information to intending visitors and increase awareness of the estate both among tourists and citizens:<\/p><p>- The sites are generally marketed by the OPW under the Heritage Ireland brand with a website of the same name providing all information relating to the properties.This site is being renewed with a new design and layout before the end of 2019;<\/p><p>- Maps, publications and flyers on visitor sites are widely available to intending visitors through a national distribution contract covering hotels, train and bus stations, tourist offices etc<\/p><p>- A range of complementary initiatives such as Free Wednesday and U-12&rsquo;s Go Free and Free Disabled Entry also help raise the profile of the heritage estate in State care and prove popular with visitors.<\/p><p>- In recent years the OPW has negotiated agreements with partner organisations abroad such as English Heritage and Manx Heritage to grant their members free access to the sites here to encourage more visitors from the UK area;<\/p><p>- In addition to some limited traditional advertising in magazines etc, the OPW also makes extensive use of digital technologies with over 50 Facebook pages and Instagram accounts which see very good engagement with users on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>- The OPW also produces an electronic magazine Heritage Ireland which is widely distributed online and showcases the sites in greater detail.<\/p><p>- Online booking is used as a promotional tool and an active programme is underway to extend its availability: it was first introduced at Kilmainham Gaol in 2016 and is now in place at a further six sites with up to 3 more locations targeted for 2019.<\/p><p>- OPW sells visitor heritage cards at all sites, facilitating tourists who wish to visit multiple properties during their stay.These are available at all locations in Adult, Family Senior and Child categories and will shortly be available to purchase online.<\/p><p>- OPW participates at tourism industry events such as Meitheal where we  interact with industry partners and tour operators and also attends at other promotional events such as Holiday Fair, Active Retirement, Over 55s etc.<\/p><p>- OPW participates with stands at gardening and agricultural shows such as Bloom, the Tullamore Show, the Ploughing Championships etc;<\/p><p>- Allowing the use of sites for filming can have promotional benefits both as film locations and also for tourism magazine programmes.Sites have therefore been used as locations for productions including Star Wars, Penny Dreadful and Ripper Street and access granted for programmes such as Nationwide, Tracks &amp;amp;

While this is challenging, it is important to note that we are in a strong position from which to meet that challenge.

An important goal of the current framework for Public Service reform - Our Public Service 2020 - which became operational during 2018, is to encourage innovation across the public service and to promote different service delivery options. This notably includes supporting the use of Business Process Automation, as referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, to help public service organisations to deliver leaner, faster and cheaper back-office functions. <\/p>  <p>  Automation of the rules-based and repetitive processes that are a necessary and unavoidable feature of the work of most public service bodies has the potential also to add significant value to our workforce by freeing up individuals to concentrate on more value-add as well as interesting and engaging work.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, my Department funded a pilot project in 2016 to examine the potential of Business Process Automation in the delivery of public services. Government Departments and Offices were invited to propose suitable processes that would be amenable to such automation. The Revenue Commissioners, the Public Appointments Service, the Property Registration Authority and the National Shared Services Office participated in this pilot under which a total of 14 processes were automated at a total cost of approximately &euro;110,000. <\/p>  <p>  The results of this pilot suggest that the solution can work very well in the right circumstances.

This framework will allow public service bodies to rapidly deploy automation within their organisations and train their own staff to automate suitable processes.

Reflecting on this, there are clear risks to the expenditure position associated with restating expenditure ceilings and for example applying inflationary increases as a revised baseline for any new expenditure. This can lead to the expenditure &lsquo;ceiling&rsquo; becoming a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; from which\u00a0further expenditure increases are\u00a0negotiated, which in turn can lead to unsustainable trends that are not affordable on a long-term basis. <\/p>  <p>  To mitigate against this, the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2016 set out an expenditure strategy for 2016 to 2021 in which current expenditure would grow by an annual average of 2 &frac12; per cent, while capital expenditure would grow at 12 &frac12; per cent on average.

In setting out the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal strategy in the SES, I will take into account recent developments, in particular in the external environment, and will consider the points raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in its recent fiscal assessment report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000052#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000053#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000053#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[25903\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000053#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of Defence Forces members referred to the HSE for psychiatric services and placed on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist since 26 July 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>The number of Defence Forces personnel availing of psychiatric services through the HSE since July 2018, is not readily available.

My Department continually analyses and prepares briefing on short and medium-term macroeconomic trends in European and international economy. This includes informing me of the latest forecasts from the international institutions for the global economy, and for our key trading partners.<\/p><p>At European level, through both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, Ministers work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to take stock of the latest economic situation, including the risks and opportunities for European economies in the short to medium-term. <\/p><p>As published in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019, my Department has forecast economic growth to moderate to a more sustainable rate of 3.9 per cent in 2019, and to continue at the broadly similar pace of 3.3 per cent for 2020. Although growth rates have moderated from 2018, they still compare very favourably to other EU, and significant non-EU, trading partners.<\/p><p>Growth in the Irish economy is expected to come from both modified domestic demand, which is set to increase by 4.0 per cent in 2019, and an expansion in Irish exports &ndash; which are set to grow by 5.2 per cent this year. Modified domestic demand excludes the volatile components of investment spending &ndash; giving a more accurate picture of the health of domestic economic activity. <\/p><p>The SPU sets out the principal economic risks facing the Irish economy (e.g. domestic overheating and capacity constraints, trade disruptions, Brexit), along with an assessment of their relative likelihood and economic impact. The balance of risk is firmly tilted to the downside, both in the short-term and over the medium-term. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s economic data compare favourably to those of our main trading partners &ndash; with growth, unemployment, and inflation performing better than the Euro Area and EU averages - as the data in Table 1 below illustrate. <\/p><p>The European economy is projected to grow for the seventh year in a row in 2019, albeit moderately, with expansion forecast in all Member States. The pace of growth is expected to ease compared to the high rates of recent years &ndash; to 1.4 per cent this year and picking up slightly to 1.6 per cent in 2020. For the Euro Area, the Commission is forecasting growth of 1.2 per cent this year, strengthening slightly to 1.5 per cent in 2020. <\/p><p>Annual UK GDP growth slowed from 1.8 per cent in 2017 to 1.4 per cent in 2018 due to a range of factors including falling business investment and slowing external demand. In the light of Brexit, projections for 2019 and 2020 of 1.3 per cent are based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading patterns between the EU27 and the UK. Growth in the US economy will slow but remain relatively strong at 2.4 per cent for 2019, easing further to 1.9 per cent in 2020. <\/p><p>In common with Ireland, unemployment continues to fall in the EU and US, with the US labour market set to tighten further as it approaches full employment. In the UK, unemployment will remain stable as employment growth slows in the context of subdued GDP figures.<\/p><p>The Government has taken significant action to ensure Ireland is aware of, and ready for developments in major partner countries. We have worked hard to rebalance our economy from where it was in the previous decade, before the global financial crisis. Growth in our economy today is evenly spread across a range of sectors, equipping us to better withstand the challenges ahead. The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities while working in accordance with our EU partners.  <\/p><p>Table 1<table><tr><th><\/th><th>Real GDP <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Inflation <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Unemployment <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2018 <\/td><td>2019 <\/td><td>2020 <\/td><td>2018<\/td><td>2019<\/td><td>2020<\/td><td>2018 <\/td><td>2019 <\/td><td>2020 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ireland (SPU 2019 forecasts) <\/td><td>6.7 <\/td><td>3.9 <\/td><td>3.3 <\/td><td>0.7 <\/td><td>0.9 <\/td><td>1.1 <\/td><td>5.7 <\/td><td>5.4 <\/td><td>5.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UK <\/td><td>1.4 <\/td><td>1.3 <\/td><td>1.3 <\/td><td>2.5 <\/td><td>2.0 <\/td><td>2.1 <\/td><td>4.0 <\/td><td>4.1 <\/td><td>4.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Euro Area <\/td><td>1.9 <\/td><td>1.2 <\/td><td>1.5 <\/td><td>1.8 <\/td><td>1.4 <\/td><td>1.4 <\/td><td>8.2 <\/td><td>7.7 <\/td><td>7.3 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU28 <\/td><td>2.0 <\/td><td>1.4 <\/td><td>1.6 <\/td><td>1.9 <\/td><td>1.6 <\/td><td>1.7 <\/td><td>6.8 <\/td><td>6.5 <\/td><td>6.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>US <\/td><td>2.9 <\/td><td>2.4 <\/td><td>1.9 <\/td><td>2.4 <\/td><td>2.0 <\/td><td>2.0 <\/td><td>3.9 <\/td><td>3.8 <\/td><td>3.7 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>Source: European Commission Spring 2019 forecasts and Department of Finance SPU 2019 forecasts for Ireland <\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000053#WRD05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Staff","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000053#WRD05500"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[25888\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000053#WRD05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of additional Revenue Commissioners' staff who have been recruited to meet the challenges posed by Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that since the start of 2019, Revenue has appointed over 550 staff from open recruitment and interdepartmental competitions, the majority of these have been assigned to customs roles or to backfill positions from which existing Revenue staff have been assigned to customs duties.

This is transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulation 2015 (SI No. 485 of 2015). Solvency II provides the basis for how insurers can operate in the EU and amongst other things prohibits interference by me or the Central Bank of Ireland in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  It also precludes models such as the fuel tax one proposed in the attached correspondence. The second proposal to establish a national insurance scheme for under 25s would also be problematic as any such arrangement would have to comply with the standard prudential rules that apply to private insurers. Because of the concentration of such a high risk category in one company, such insurance would likely be very expensive. In relation to the third option, of a cross-subsidisation of younger drivers, it is difficult to see that there would be much support from already hard pressed motorists for this proposal as it could add significantly to their existing premiums. <\/p><p>In pricing insurance, I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  I acknowledge the point that it would be helpful if insurers provided appropriately anonymised actuarial data to support their case with regard to pricing policy for younger motorists, however insurers argue that such information is commercially sensitive and unfortunately I am not in a position to compel them to disclose such information.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.The initial focus of the Working Group was on motor insurance premiums The <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>was published in January 201 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  <\/i>This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  <\/p><p>There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two aforementioned reports, including the following:<\/p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent  recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;<\/p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; <\/p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>;<\/p><p>- amendments  to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud  or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,<\/p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,  including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as  the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focuson insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.  <\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  It is acknowledged however that this is an average figure and young drivers may not be benefitting to the same degree.<\/p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a further sustainable reduction in insurance costs for motorists is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.<\/p><p>It should be noted that work is progressing as a matter of priority on the Judicial Council Bill, and it is due to complete Report and Final Stages in the Seanad this week, prior to being submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.  I would hope that members of both Houses of the Oireachtas can collectively work together to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill is enacted by the summer.<\/p><p>Finally, I would advise younger drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website (), which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.  One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to motorists.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and as part of that exercise, there was and has been extensive interaction with the insurance industry and its representative bodies.  The <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>was published in January 201 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  <\/i>This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  While this Report is focussed on addressing issues linked to business insurance, the implementation of recommendations from both reports will have a positive impact for all consumers and businesses including motorists.  <\/p><p>There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two aforementioned reports, including the following:<\/p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;<\/p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; <\/p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>;<\/p><p>- amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,<\/p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, which targets insurance-related criminality. <\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  <\/p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a further sustainable reduction in insurance costs for motorists is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that work is progressing as a matter of priority on the Judicial Council Bill, and it is due to complete Report and Final Stages in the Seanad this week, prior to being submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.

More recently, there has been significant investment in the residential sector. Much of this investment has been in the form of non-bank lending and equity financing.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the increase in foreign investment in the construction sector, the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s (CBI) recent Systemic Risk Pack, published in March this year, stated that &ldquo;Property-related lending accounts for 68 per cent of Irish banks loan book, highlighting a concentration risk amongst Irish resident banks. This compares to a long run average of 62 per cent and a European average of approximately 60 per cent measured at 2018 Q2&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The domestic banks&rsquo; need to reduce their exposure to the property sector in the aftermath of the economic crisis meant that the absence of international investment would have resulted in somewhat lower levels of activity in the commercial and residential sectors. Access to foreign capital, whether through direct investment, equity, or lending played an important part in the recovery of the construction sector. Given the relatively high level of property-related exposure that remains on the domestic bank&rsquo;s balance sheets, foreign capital will continue to play an important role in the Irish construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  The presence of foreign investors can expose the domestic market to international financing conditions and overseas asset market corrections. The propensity for international investors to diversify across different markets, including Ireland, may see these markets becoming more synchronised with global real estate cycles.

In the years preceding the crisis, large increases in expenditure were implemented on an annual basis, which ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Reflecting on this, there are clear risks to the expenditure position associated with restating expenditure ceilings, and for example applying inflationary increases, as a revised baseline for any new expenditure. This can lead to the expenditure &lsquo;ceiling&rsquo; becoming a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; from which to negotiate, which in turn can lead to unsustainable increases that are not affordable on a long-term basis. <\/p>  <p>  To mitigate against this, the Summer Economic Statement 2016 set out an expenditure strategy for 2016 to 2021 in which current expenditure would grow by an annual average of 2 &frac12; per cent. This approach has been adopted in each annual Summer Economic Statement produced since. While there have been variations from the expenditure targets set out in the publications, these have been largely driven by policy decisions to support key Government programmes. For example, additional funding has been provided for our Health Service and increased investment in public capital infrastructure reflecting the allocation of additional resources set out in the National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway on the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2019.

Indeed modified domestic demand, an underlying measure of growth in the economy, grew by 4.5 per cent for 2018 as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  One of the best barometers of the heath in the economy is the labour market.  The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 81,200 (+3.7 per cent) in the year to Q1 2019. As a result, there are now more people working in Ireland than ever before. <\/p>  <p>  At the cornerstone of our recovery, has been the improvement in our competitiveness. Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent. The improvement in our competitiveness reflects the hard-won productivity gains made over the last number of years, alongside wage and price moderation. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In the first four months of 2019, average annual inflation of just 1.1 per cent was recorded. <\/p>  <p>  On wage developments, while average annual earnings grew by over 3 per cent in 2018, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in household incomes is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely to avoid a significant acceleration in wages, which may undermine Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness to other European countries.<\/p>  <p>  Over the medium term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, as we approach full employment, the economy is in an unusual position, with possible domestic overheating and capacity constraints on one hand and a slowdown in key export markets on the other. Brexit also represents a significant risk and is part of a wider environment of global uncertainty. In order to mitigate against these risks, it is important that the economy is in a strong position to retain competitiveness and resistant to external shocks. Taking this into account, the National Development Plan (NDP) includes a more than doubling of capital investment from &euro;4.2 to &euro;8.6 billion between 2016 and 2021. This increase reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing bottlenecks which could hinder the economy going forward. <\/p>  <p>  These risks mentioned above highlight the need for a cautious approach to expenditure policy, which is sustainable now and into the future. In contrast to the increases in expenditure seen in the years leading up to the crisis, recent expenditure increases have been based on sustainable growth underpinned by predictable revenue sources. It is crucial that this approach is maintained in the medium term in order to mitigate against emerging risks in the domestic and global economy. As such, the expenditure ceilings set out in the forthcoming SES will be based on the expenditure strategy set out in the SPU, published by the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland still has a significant level of public debt following the global financial crisis. While debt-to-GDP ratio has been declining over recent years, this is primarily due to the increase in GDP, rather than a reduction in the debt itself, which remains at over &euro;200 million. At the end of 2018, our debt ratio as a percentage of GDP was 64.8 per cent. Maintaining sustainable expenditure policy is an important element of ensuring that our economy is performing well and that our debt-to-GDP and debt-to-GNI* ratios continue to decline. This includes ensuring that we are delivering public services in the most efficient and effective way possible. To this end, a number of reforms have been put in place in recent years, including the Performance Budgeting Initiative, the Equality Budgeting Initiative, the National Economic Dialogue and the Spending Review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000054#WRE07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Policy","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000055#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[26024\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000055#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he continues to meet targets in public expenditure and reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>My Department has recently published its Annual Report for 2018 on the Gov.ie website ( <i> <\/i>).

At that time, the Society also employed a dedicated advertising regulations executive to pro-actively enforce the regulation of this area.  Accordingly, the Law Society has been able to provide statistics relating to its enforcement, of primary legislation and the Solicitors (Advertising) Regulations 2002, from 2014. As can be seen from the figures provided, in all, some 28 websites owned by solicitors or other operators have now been removed or have become inoperable. This, I understand, includes some removed since the end of last year and two websites that are dormant following liquidation of the company concerned.

Under that section, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. This new regime, which will apply to both solicitors and barristers, will come into effect early next year including in terms of the provision of any relevant statistical data.

The Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. This is reflected in the ongoing additional investment made in these services in recent years with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019. That is about a 45% increase in the annual budget for home support.<\/p><p>In 2018, the total budget for the service was &euro;416.8 million, providing over 17.5 million hours. In 2019 almost &euro;30 million has been added to the home support budget. This year the HSE intends to provide over 18.2 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, to over 53,000 people. When one looks at the year-on-year targets, this means that this year&rsquo;s National Service Plan aims to deliver about 800,000 more hours than the 2018 target. I expect the HSE to deliver on this service plan commitment.<\/p><p>The allocation of funding for home supports, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available. The Home Support Service is not demand led and is therefore operated in line with agreed budgetary limits and targets as set out in the HSE National Service Plan.<\/p><p>To achieve compliance with its funding allocation, the HSE must ensure that the value of the total number of hours provided does not exceed the budget. This means that the HSE has to manage its service delivery over the course of the year to align with the total funding available.

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The plan includes a target to reduce the number of patients waiting for and Inpatient\/Day Case procedure from just over 70,000 in December 2018 to 60,000 by year end and to reduce the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. The latter target takes into account the fact that more than 800,000 new patients will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019, a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialties, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the plans to reduce waiting times at Midlands Regional Hospital, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[25979\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide an upgraded primary health facility at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":419,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare services and infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05200"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[25987\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) who is employed on a rural social scheme was requested again to provide a notice of assessment in respect of employment and or self-employment when they are entitled to retain their medical card for the duration of participation on the scheme; if the HSE will issue the medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05500"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[25994\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the wording of the Treatments of Cancer (Advertisements) Bill 2018 will be reconsidered (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>It is not the intention that there be any unintended consequences of the Bill.

The Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. This is reflected in the ongoing additional investment made in these services in recent years with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019.

This year the HSE intends to provide over 18.2 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, to over 53,000 people.

The Home Support Service is not demand led and is therefore operated in line with agreed budgetary limits and targets as set out in the HSE National Service Plan.<\/p><p>To achieve compliance with its funding allocation, the HSE must ensure that the value of the total number of hours provided does not exceed the budget. This means that the HSE has to manage its service delivery over the course of the year to align with the total funding available. It also has a responsibility to ensure that activity is planned so as to anticipate critical demand pressures, most particularly emergency pressures in the initial and latter parts of the year.<\/p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply directly in relation to the operational aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Remuneration","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06400"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[26050\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) is entitled to a HSE pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Farming","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06700"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[25898\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if salmon farm escapes have been reported from 1 June 2018 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>My Department's records do not indicate any reports of fish escapes from salmon farms during the period referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Re-introduction of Grey Wolf","counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH07000"},{"type":"question","counter":439,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[25899\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000057#WRH07100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider examining the feasibility of reintroducing the grey wolf species as a cost effective alternative or additional measure to the BTB eradication programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":440,"content":"<p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (the IUCN) have developed Guidelines on Reintroductions and Conservation Translocations<i>. <\/i>These guidelines were developed by conservation experts and practitioners and they provide the benchmark for international best practice in this field.<\/p><p>The IUCN document sets out an initial checklist for those considering a reintroduction project such as the grey wolf.

Reducing agricultural emissions;<\/p><p>2. Increasing carbon sequestration; and<\/p><p>3.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.<\/p><p>My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These measures aim to recognise the needs of carers through the provision of appropriate income supports, to enable carers to remain in touch with the labour market to the greatest extent possible and to empower carers to participate fully in economic and social life.<\/p><p>These income supports include the following:<\/p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Allowance <\/p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Benefit <\/p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant<\/p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance <\/p><p>Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the Household Benefits Package and a Free Travel Pass.<\/p><p>Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p><p>Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments.<\/p><p>The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.<\/p><p>Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost up to &euro;1.2 billion per annum.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000059#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000059#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[25932\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062000059#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a review of a claim for a disability allowance by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded disability allowance with effect from 18 July 2018.

Wolves travel in packs and require vast home ranges.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has noted, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (the IUCN) have developed Guidelines on Reintroductions and Conservation Translocations.
