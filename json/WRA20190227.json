The TIPH, a civilian observer mission which was established in 1997 as part of United Nations Security Council Resolution 904 and the Oslo II accords, has played an important role in mitigating tension and conflict in Hebron. <\/p>  <p>  Observers have been sent from five contributing countries: Norway, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. The area of responsibility of the mission covers both the H1 and H2 areas of Hebron, the Palestinian and the Israeli-controlled areas. <\/p>  <p>  This conflict prevention mechanism has continued to meet a vital need, and has promoted a feeling of security to the Palestinians of Hebron.  No adequate reason has been given for the decision to end its mandate, which would seem to be a unilateral breach by Israel of the Oslo Accords. <\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal of the international presence is likely to accentuate tensions on the ground in an already fragile situation in Hebron. Ireland regrets this decision and I call on Israel to reverse it. Ireland stands with the EU in stressing that Israel must fulfil its obligations under international law, as an occupying power, to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory. This decision will instead reduce those protections, leaving Palestinians more vulnerable to persistent attacks by settlers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent to this announcement, the observers from a separate, non-governmental, protection mission that had been active in Hebron, the ecumenical accompaniment programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) has reportedly decided to halt its work in the H2 area of Hebron. This decision has been made following a number of serious incidents of harassment by Israeli settlers against its volunteers. EAPPI has been in existence since 2002, and has provided a feeling of protection, by means of their presence in vulnerable communities in the West Bank, particularly for communities at risk of forcible transfer, farmers at heightened risk of settler violence and to students and teachers in areas of the West Bank where safe access to school is not guaranteed. <\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal of the TIPH has now led the EAPPI to conclude that it too must withdraw its volunteers from the H2 area of Hebron. Many Irish volunteers have participated in the EAPPI programme over the years, and my Department has met with them from time to time, and values their work. <\/p>  <p>  Both the TIPH and the EAPPI in Hebron have been engaged in protecting children going to school from attacks by settlers, something which will have immediate resonance with Irish people. These children too are now under increased risk.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to take a firm stance on matters relating to the Palestinian people and the Middle East Peace Process. At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council last year, Ireland raised the continued expansion of settlements, the establishment of which violates the rights of the occupied population, through seizure of their land, discriminatory treatment, house demolitions, revocation of residency, and differentiated application of planning laws. Ireland urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. <\/p>  <p>  I reiterated our concerns about these policies in my speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2018. The Israeli authorities are well aware of our views, and we will certainly convey our specific concerns about the case of Hebron.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[7341\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is assessing the impact of Irish unity and planning accordingly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island North and South. <\/p>  <p>  The full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements is a priority for my Department and indeed the Government as a whole. The approach of the Government in relation to Irish unity is of course guided by Article 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the people in 1998. <\/p>  <p>  The Agreement states clearly that &ldquo;it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right to self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Agreement, the two Governments &ldquo;recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Britain or a sovereign united Ireland&rdquo;. And should such a choice be made in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.<\/p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Secretary of State shall exercise this power \"if at any time it appears likely ... that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.\"<\/p>  <p>  At present, the Government does not believe it likely that such a border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change. In these circumstances, it is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that such a poll would only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of the prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has no immediate plans for specific preparations on this issue. My immediate priorities are to secure the functioning of the devolved power-sharing institutions and the North South Ministerial Council, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, through the ongoing Article 50 negotiation between the European Union and the UK, which are at a critical point.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work. In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those provisions relating to a possible change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU. As a result of intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government, we have secured the solidarity and support of all our EU partners on ensuring the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and of the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, through the process of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 April 2017, the European Council adopted Guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations which included a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits, and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement. These Guidelines remain the basis of the Union&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations with the UK, including on the Ireland-specific issues. Also on 29 April 2017 the European Council agreed a statement acknowledging that the Good Friday Agreement provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about and that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has nonetheless been very clear that we do not see the UK exit from the European Union as a pretext or an opportunity for the holding of a border poll in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sustainable Development Goals","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[9690\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on extending the memorandum of understanding between the HSE and Irish Aid operating in relation to Sub-Saharan African countries to Nepal as a low income Asian country with poor health indicators; and his further views on the need for extending this collaboration.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>Through Ireland's International Development Cooperation programme, recognised as one of the best in the world, my Department prioritises and invests in addressing global health challenges and in strengthening health systems.

What began as a conflict between the internationally-recognised Government and the Houthi de facto authorities has developed to involve outside actors including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. The presence of other non-state fighting and terrorist groups further complicates the crisis. Both at UN level, and in EU discussions on the issue, Ireland has stressed that military action cannot be a solution.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the work of the United Nations in attempting to bring the conflict to a political resolution. Implementation of the agreements reached in Stockholm in December 2018 remains crucial. The international community is maintaining pressure on the parties to engage with the UN Special Envoy, the Redeployment Coordination Committee, and the United Nations Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA).  <\/p>  <p>  Lawlessness and weak governance are problems throughout Yemen. In relation to the allegations referred to by Deputy Connolly, I understand that there have been media reports alleging that mercenaries engaged by the United Arab Emirates have targeted members of the Al Islah movement in Yemen. I have no independent source of information to allow me to comment on the accuracy of these reports. I am glad to have this opportunity to urge all parties to the conflict to ensure that the principles of international law and international humanitarian law are respected.<\/p>  <p>  The Group of Eminent Experts (GEE) on Yemen, which Ireland played a key role in establishing at the Human Rights Council in September 2017, is continuing to investigate all alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all warring parties in Yemen. I look forward to their report later this year, which will be a valuable contribution to accountability for violations committed.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the humanitarian situation, after nearly four years of war, the Yemeni economy has all but collapsed, and with Government salaries going unpaid, millions are food insecure and have difficulties in accessing basic healthcare services. Both humanitarian and commercial access are often restricted, further exacerbating the situation. The UN reports that almost 80% of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is contributing towards the humanitarian effort and has provided almost &euro;17.5 million in assistance to Yemen since 2015. Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development Ciar&aacute;n Cannon attended a High-Level Pledging Event in Geneva just yesterday, where he pledged, on behalf of the Government, that Ireland will provide a further &euro;5 million to the UN Yemen Humanitarian Fund this year.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to global funds that allocate funding to the Yemen Crisis, including the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which disbursed $50 million in 2018 to bolster the humanitarian response in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Significant EU funds are also channelled towards humanitarian support in Yemen. Since 2015, the EU has contributed a total of &euro;438 million to Yemen towards humanitarian, development, stabilisation and resilience support. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor the situation in Yemen, contribute what we can to the humanitarian response and continue to call on all parties to the conflict to engage with the UN-led process, with a view to resolving this alarming humanitarian crisis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[9741\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he raised the issue of the Israeli Government withholding taxes that it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority from the authority with his counterparts across Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>Last week the Government of Israel decided unilaterally to withhold the equivalent of 123 million Euro in Palestinian tax revenue transfers.  This decision is a result of legislation adopted by the Knesset last year that instructs the Government to withhold money equivalent to what the PA pays to Palestinians convicted by Israeli courts of involvement in terrorism or other security-related offenses, and to their families.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand that the Palestinian leadership has in response decided to reject all clearance revenue in protest at the funding cut, which no doubt will have repercussions for the Palestinian people who depend on the PA to deliver basic services such as healthcare and access to education.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely concerned about the worsening financial situation of the PA. Thankfully the impact of its budget shortfall last year was somewhat mitigated by donor aid.

The financial stability of the PA is inextricably linked to the security of both the Palestinians and the Israelis.  I believe that the EU is right to urge the Palestinian Authority to review how it operates its system of payments. However, as I have said before in this House and elsewhere, unilateral moves, such as withholding a huge proportion of the revenue collected on the Palestinian Authority's behalf, seriously undermine the chances for a just and lasting peace. <\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the EU&rsquo;s call for  Israel to honour its obligations under the Oslo Accords, with due regard to the Paris Economic Protocol, which administers the economic and financial relations between Israel and the PA. <\/p>  <p>  These are very serious developments that put at risk the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority and ultimately the security of both Israelis and Palestinians alike. <\/p>  <p>  EU Heads of Mission, including the Irish representative, met with senior figures from the Palestinian Authority to discuss this decision.

Reducing barriers to returning emigrants has important implications for national competitiveness; in a growing Irish economy facilitating the return of skills will be of importance in sustaining economic growth. <\/p>  <p>  In my capacity as Minister of State for the Diaspora, I chair the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Irish Abroad which works to ensure that Government works in a joined up way to realise the objectives of Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora Policy, including addressing issues affecting the Irish abroad and those seeking to return. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the work by the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Irish Abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade commissioned an independent economic report on difficulties experienced by Irish people returning home. Following a competitive tendering process, this report was completed by economic consultants Indecon in February 2018, considered by Government, and was published on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Indecon Economic Report on Addressing Challenges Faced by Returning Irish Emigrants, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has undertaken a number of steps, in conjunction with other Government Departments and State Agencies, to address the thirty recommendations made in the report. Most recently, I wrote to relevant Ministers in December 2018 seeking a further update on progress on their individual areas of responsibility. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, nineteen of the total thirty recommendations have been, or are in the process of being addressed. Departments are aware of further action to be taken in respect of 6 recommendations. The remaining recommendations are being partially implemented, or are being considered as part of a wider issue rather than in the context of the recommendation alone. <\/p>  <p>  All responses made in respect of these recommendations will inform a further Memorandum to Government on the progress made since the publication of the Indecon Report.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has already implemented several of the Indecon Report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to information provision. An enhanced &lsquo;Returning to Ireland&rsquo; section containing more information and advice for returning emigrants has been developed for our dedicated diaspora website, the Global Irish Hub. Officials are working closely with the Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board to ensure that returning emigrants have the best information and advice possible to assist them in making the return back to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following on from a successful pilot programme in 2018, I recently launched the second year of the Back for Business programme - a mentoring programme designed to assist returning emigrants to set up business in Ireland. The programme works to assist returning emigrant entrepreneurs by addressing the challenges that all early stage entrepreneurs face, with a particular focus on the additional barriers and challenges faced by those who have been out of the country for some time. The programme is based on a model of mentor support, and will run from February to July 2019.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":38,"content":"<p>Question No. 20 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[9691\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when Ireland will ratify the Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement on the EU and Cuba.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[9437\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when Ireland will ratify the Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement between the EU and Cuba; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[9637\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement will be ratified (details supplied).","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 25 and 30 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully supports the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA), which was signed by each EU Member State and the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016.    This is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marked a further positive step forward in relations between Cuba and the EU, which have improved considerably in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely Political Dialogue, Cooperation and Sectoral Policy Dialogue, and Trade and Trade Cooperation.  The core aim of the PDCA is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy, and work together to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2017, the European Parliament voted to endorse the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement.  While most of the Agreement has been provisionally applied since November 2017, its full application will require ratification by the EU once Member States have completed their own internal legal procedures. A number of remaining Member States, including Ireland, have yet to complete their internal procedures.  The process, involving my Department and the Oireachtas, has been initiated and we are committed to completing it at the earliest possible opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  The entry into force of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement and improvements in the EU-Cuba relationship will in turn have helpful consequences for the Ireland-Cuba relationship.  Ireland has a positive relationship with Cuba and this year marks the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries.  <\/p>  <p>  The visit of President Higgins to the island in 2017 was a high point in our relations and facilitated the strengthening of ties between our two countries. This visit also highlighted the interesting shared history between the two countries, with Irish emigrants having contributed to the economic, cultural and political evolution of Cuba over the years, and Cuban leaders having been influenced by the leaders of the Irish revolutionary and independence movements. <\/p>  <p>  This high-level engagement continued with the visit of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Ana Teresita Gonz&aacute;lez, to Dublin for political consultations in October 2018, and with Minister of State for Disability Issues, Finian McGrath T.D., scheduled to visit Cuba over the St Patrick's Day period next month.  <\/p>  <p>  My assessment is that the PDCA provides a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen both EU-Cuba and Ireland-Cuba relations.  I look forward to continued positive developments in the period ahead, including the announcement of completion by Ireland of the internal legal procedures necessary for EU ratification.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":44,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 22 and 23 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA04400"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[9737\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views with regard to some supporters of Israel attempting to equate anti-Semitism with criticism of Israeli treatment of Palestinians; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>Ireland strongly condemns all manifestations of racism, xenophobia, and related intolerance, including anti-Semitism.  Ireland is strongly committed to the promotion and protection of tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Through our multilateral engagement, Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN&rsquo;s Human Rights Council, (HRC), through the Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism and at the European Union. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a signatory of the Stockholm Declaration of the International Forum on the Holocaust and Ireland joined the Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2011. As a signatory to the Stockholm Declaration, Ireland has made a commitment to fight against the evils of anti-Semitism, genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, xenophobia and other expressions of hatred. I also attended and participated in the National Holocaust Memorial Day in Dublin on 27th January this year, during which I read aloud an excerpt from the Stockholm Declaration. <\/p>  <p>  There is, thankfully, no significant political party in Ireland hostile to immigrants, or to minorities such as the Jewish community.

Earlier this year, an Irish synagogue was defaced with swastika graffiti &ndash; something which I utterly condemn, and which must encourage us all to renew our commitment to rooting out anti-Semitism. <\/p>  <p>  Successive Irish Governments, as well as public representatives, NGOs and individuals, have voiced strong criticisms of Israel&rsquo;s policies in the occupied Palestinian territory.  I have done so myself.  The same is true in many other countries.  It is to be expected that any country which is engaged in a military occupation of another people will be subject to a particularly high level of scrutiny. These criticisms are based not on anti-Semitism or hostility, but on our values of respect for justice, human rights and the rule of law. There are of course very many people in Israel who share critical views on the conduct of the occupation of the Palestinian territory.<\/p>  <p>  Criticism of Israeli policy is not in and of itself anti-Semitic, and to conflate these things is unjust, counter-productive, and potentially very damaging.  Conflating just and valid criticism of Israeli actions, with anti-Semitic attitudes, risks unfairly stigmatising people who are motivated by a desire for justice for the Palestinians, and blunting the reflex of horror we should all have at real manifestations of anti-Semitism. Conversely, I also believe that it is wrong when criticism of Israeli government actions conflates the Jewish people &ndash; globally or in Ireland &ndash; with the government of Israel. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that in criticising Israel&rsquo;s occupation of the Palestinian people &ndash; something which I will continue to do as long as that occupation lasts &ndash; it is essential to base our criticism on values we hold consistently and globally, including respect for human rights and for international law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700080#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":48,"content":"<p>Question No. 25 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":49,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 26 and 27 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700081#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[9743\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700081#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is satisfied that sufficient resources are in place to deal with increased volume in passport applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The Passport Service has seen significant increases in passport applications received in recent years. The increase in demand is driven by a number of factors including a general increase in the number of Irish residents travelling abroad, a growing population, as well as a rise in passport applications from Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service monitors the volume of applications on an ongoing basis to ensure that resources are available to meet demand. Measures taken to address to address anticipated application increases and seasonal demand include increased staff allocation and a number of technology and customer service initiatives. <\/p>  <p>  Staffing needs in the Passport Service are assessed on the basis of a number of factors including forecasted demand, the balance between more complex first-time applications and renewals as well as the uptake of online services and associated productivity gains. The Passport Service has received approval to recruit over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) in 2019 to assist in processing passport applications and to deal with the queries from the general public.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, the Passport Service employed 363.2 Full Time Equivalent staff. This is an increase of over 40 staff since the same point in 2017. Already this year, 60 additional Full Time Equivalent staff have taken up roles in the Passport Service. Targeted overtime has been sanctioned for both permanent and temporary staff when required. <\/p>  <p>  A dedicated Customer Service Hub has been established to deal with queries from the public. The number of staff that will be answering Customer Service queries will have trebled since 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The award winning Online Passport Renewal Service has been the most significant project launched under the Programme to date. Other projects that will advance in 2019 include the development of business process automation, document management systems and the acquisition of mailing machines.<\/p>  <p>  The Online Passport Renewal Service, which was launched in March 2017 has recently been expanded to accommodate additional categories of applications including child renewal applications. This expansion means more than half of all passport applicants are now eligible to renew online. The Online Passport Renewal Service bring benefits for customers with faster turnaround times of 10 working days, excluding postage time. In addition to this, the costs of renewing a passport online is cheaper than alternative methods. Fees for all online applications have been reduced by &euro;5 across all application types. <\/p>  <p>   Over 70% of eligible applicants are now utilising the online renewal service instead of paper applications. A strong take-up for online services will improve the capacity of the Passport Service to manage increasing application volumes.

Those persons referred to by the Deputy are among a number of people whom NGOs report to have been detained on account of their human rights activism, or due to the activism of their family members. A number of human rights organisations have claimed that these women are subjected to sustained abuses in prison, a cause for serious concern. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland consistently advocates for the right of civil society actors and human rights defenders to operate in a safe environment, without fear of reprisal for speaking out.

In September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on the Bahraini authorities to respect the freedoms of opinion and expression, as well as the right to a fair trial.

We do this in direct contact with other countries or multilaterally through our involvement in global and regional organisations, including the EU and the UN. <\/p>  <p>  Together with our EU and UN partners, and through our Embassies on the ground, we will continue to closely monitor crises across the globe, supporting political efforts to resolve conflicts, end ethnic violence and human rights abuses, providing humanitarian relief and targeting our overseas assistance to communities most in need. Working through global organisations such as the United Nations or regional bodies such as the EU or the Organisation for Security Cooperation in Europe, the international community is able to bring positive influence to bear in the search for political solutions to conflict situations around the world.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting and sustaining peacebuilding efforts has been long been a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland promotes international peace and security by supporting the work programmes of multilateral, regional organisations and leading civil society organisations in this field. In 2018, the Department provided approximately &euro;6.7 million euro to 34 organisations working on peace and security projects across the globe.  Many of these partners have significant peace and security programmes in Africa, for example, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue works to bring women into peace discussions, Conciliation Resources works to involve local communities in peacebuilding activities in the Horn of Africa. In addition the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade is a donor to the UN&rsquo;s Peacebuilding Fund and the Mediation Support Unit. <\/p>  <p>  Meetings of the EU Foreign Affairs Council provide regular opportunities at which to consider issues as such the below mentioned and to shape the responses of the EU and the wider international community to them. The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. <\/p>  <p>  Human rights concerns are central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries, where increased human rights violations are often a first step on a trajectory to mass atrocity crimes. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question. Ireland supports the use of the full multilateral human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses including in the EU, UN and the Council of Europe. This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. At the UN, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is, of course, fully associated with these statements.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and its EU partners are strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court. By its very existence, the Court promotes and upholds not only the rule of law but also provides a means to bring to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community and in this way contributes in a most fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice. The establishment of a number of international courts and tribunals in recent years to deal with situations where the most serious crimes of concern to the international community have been committed represents a recognition on the part of the international community that such courts and tribunals are an essential means of ending a culture of impunity and of ensuring respect for international law, in particular international humanitarian law and human rights law. <\/p>  <p>  Conflict is also the most significant driver of humanitarian need. The UN estimate that over 134 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance around the world, while over 60 million people are displaced. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland works closely with partners around the world to address these needs. We are committed to the UN system, and have a strong relationship with the UN's Office for the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs, which leads and coordinates humanitarian response efforts in the most severe crises. In 2018 Ireland assumed the Chair of OCHA's Donor Support Group, and in this role we discuss with OCHA and other major donors the response to these humanitarian crises. <\/p>  <p>  Humanitarian needs have never been greater, with the UN estimating total global requirements at almost $22 billion. Ireland is a committed humanitarian donor, and in 2017 provided over &euro;180 million in humanitarian assistance. This money was used to fund partners, including the UN, International Red Cross Movement, and NGOs, to provide life saving assistance to this in greatest need. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700082#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700082#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[9999\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700082#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he, in conjunction with the international community, can positively influence the situation in Yemen; if the UN or EU have a role in the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>Yemen is currently the world's worst humanitarian situation, with the UN warning that the severity of need on the ground is deepening. Nearly four years of conflict and catastrophic economic decline are driving the country to the brink of famine. Approximately 14.3 million people are now classified as being in acute need of humanitarian aid, with around 3.2 million people requiring treatment for acute malnutrition.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and the UN are pushing for a negotiated solution to the conflict that has been driving this humanitarian need, and the UN Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths, has played a leading role. The internationally-recognised Government, and the Houthi de facto authorities (also known as Ansar al Allah) finally came to the negotiating table in December 2018, due in large part to his efforts. Agreements were reached by the parties in Stockholm in December 2018, including a fragile ceasefire in the key port city of Hodeidah and an agreement on prisoner exchange. Implementation is now crucial in attempting to reach a sustainable political settlement. <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, the UN Secretary General has urged the international community to sustain pressure on the parties to the conflict. Martin Griffiths has thanked the EU for its support thus far, saying it would not have been possible to reach agreement in Stockholm without it. On 18 February, the EU's Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions , promising to continue to engage with all parties to the conflict, as well as with regional actors, in order to support the UN-led process. <\/p>  <p>  Officers from my Department consistently convey the Government&rsquo;s strong concerns in relation to the Yemen conflict to the Saudi Arabian, United Arab Emirates and Iranian Embassies in Dublin. I myself met with the Saudi Arabian Ambassador on 13 February and highlighted the importance of the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement, as well as the pressing need to ensure access for commercial goods and humanitarian supplies. <\/p>  <p>  It is also vitally important that the international community contributes what it can to the humanitarian effort in Yemen.  The UN plays an important role in delivering and coordinating humanitarian support in Yemen, in facilitating access for commercial goods, and in providing oversight through the work of the Human Rights Council and other human rights bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU also has a significant role to play in the delivery of aid. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has allocated &euro;233.7 million in humanitarian aid to the Yemen crisis. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided almost &euro;17.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, much of which is disbursed via UN agencies, which ensure delivery on the ground.

It is clear that humanitarian needs in Gaza are critical and that all key services, particularly the health service, are under severe strain.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has responded to the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, including in Gaza, for many years. Our funding is channelled primarily through UN and multi-lateral partners. In 2018, we significantly increased our funding to the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), providing an overall contribution of &euro;9 million, so that they could continue to provide basic services such as food aid, education and health to some 5.3 million registered Palestine refugees, 1.4 million of whom are in Gaza.

This included &euro;300,000 for the OCHA-managed Humanitarian Fund. This is used to support the emergency response operations of NGOs and UN agencies. In 2018, over 80% of the oPt Humanitarian Fund addressed urgent needs in Gaza. The fund also played a particularly important role in the international response to the injuries suffered by thousands of Gaza residents during the &ldquo;Great March of Return&rdquo; protests last year.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, Ireland is committed to increasing our support to the Palestinian people.

Improving the opportunities for young Palestinians to access quality education has been a priority for Ireland in our work in Palestine for many years.<\/p>  <p>  Issues related to the situation in Palestine, including the humanitarian situation in Gaza, are regularly discussed with our EU partners.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting such rules.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  <\/p><p>In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will use a combination of rating factors, which include how the vehicle is used, as well as the age and type of the vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, and the number of drivers.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.<\/p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years with a related problem, as referred to in the PQ, being the availability of cover in the first place.  These issues were the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions, set out within an Action Plan. <\/p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and it is envisaged that the next quarterly <i>Progress Update<\/i>on implementation will be completed shortly and concentrate in particular on outlining the definitive position in relation to all of the 33 recommendations from the Motor Report as the last of the deadlines within its Action Plan passed at the end of 2018. <\/p><p>In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that, according to the CSO statistics, pricing in the motor insurance market has stabilised over the last year, albeit it is accepted that premiums are still at a high level for many people and that further decreases would be desirable.  With the full implementation of all of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, I believe that Ireland will be more attractive to new entrants thus increasing capacity as well as competition which should have a positive impact in niche areas such as motor insurance for musicians.<\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post-primary level to the recruitment of teachers of certain subjects.<\/p>  <p>  In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March of last year. <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data\/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility\/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. The Steering Group is supported by a number of working groups which are looking in detail at the issues under these broad headings. In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that In November 2018, I published the Action Plan for Teacher Supply setting out actions in the four policy areas. Actions include:<\/p>  <p>  -  The identification of data to support the analysis of teacher supply and demand. <\/p>  <p>  -  In December 2018, a national campaign to promote the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media, supported by a new &lsquo;Teaching Transforms&rsquo; webpage providing information about teaching as a career.  <\/p>  <p>  -  The development of an online teacher and substitute teacher recruitment portal is being explored<\/p>  <p>  -  The Teaching Council is undertaking a review of the implementation of the guidelines for student teacher school placements.<\/p>  <p>  -  In the current academic year, an additional &euro;1m has been allocated to the Student Assistance Fund for Professional Master of Education students, increasing the overall fund to &euro;10.1m.<\/p>  <p>  -  For the 2018\/19 school year the restrictions on the employment of teachers on career break were suspended.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration of teachers qualified in jurisdictions outside the State.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following from the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022:<\/p>  <p>  -  Marino Institute of Education will, from 2019, provide a 4-year Irish-medium B Ed for primary teachers.<\/p>  <p>  -  An Irish-medium Masters in Education for primary and post-primary teachers, including principals, commenced in September 2018 in Mary Immaculate College.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently no temporary replacement panel to recruit short term replacement teachers. However, the Deputy may wish to note that, following from the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, the Department is currently undertaking an analysis of the potential for a supply panel scheme for primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department's policy that only qualified personnel should be employed by schools as teachers. Unqualified personnel should not be appointed except in exceptional circumstances and only when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted and only for quite limited time periods. Circular 0031\/2011 issued by my Department details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers by schools, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.<\/p>  <p>  Other than the limited exceptions under Ministerial Regulations, Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, prohibits payment from Oireachtas funds to people employed as teachers in recognised schools unless they are registered with the teaching Council. The limited exceptions provided for in the regulations allow for an unregistered person to be appointed where an employer has made all reasonable efforts to appoint a registered teacher and no registered teacher is available to take up the position in question.  An unregistered person, so appointed, may not be paid from public funds for a continuous period of more than 5 consecutive school days.  The employer must be satisfied that any such person appointed is competent and capable of acting in the place of a registered teacher in the school. The employer must also continue to make all reasonable efforts to employ a registered teacher. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700083#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[9938\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700083#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he is taking to assist primary schools that are experiencing difficulties in recruiting suitable SNA support.","asker":"1250","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority.

<\/p>  <p>  -  work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans,<\/p>  <p>  -  strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of (LNG) to diversify the EU&rsquo;s energy supply,<\/p>  <p>  -  launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and<\/p>  <p>  -  work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting was in response to a shift in the direction of US trade policy which had seen the US impose tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminium (10%) imports from the EU, and other countries, to the US from 1st June 2018, following the expiry of a temporary exemption.\u00a0 The US measures were introduced following a \"Section 232\" investigation by the US Department of Commerce into the effect of imports of steel and aluminium on US national security.\u00a0 The EU did not accept the basis for the US action and responded through the various mechanisms available to it including the commencement of a case against the US at WTO level, challenging the compatibility of the US action with WTO rules, after initial dialogue with the US Authorities failed to resolve the matter.\u00a0 Ireland has fully endorsed the EU response and as part of this process I met with US Commerce Secretary Ross and other US actors on 7th May 2018 in Washington to discuss the issues and other related matters.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 10th September 2018, EU Trade Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m met U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Lighthizer to initiate the Executive Working Group (EWG), established to improve trade relations between the US and EU and address each of the topics in the Joint Statement issued by Presidents Juncker and Trump at their July meeting.\u00a0 The EWG has met a number of times since, to discuss the scope of future formal negotiations, most recently in Washington on 9th January 2019. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On 18th January 2019 the EU Commission adopted proposals for \"Negotiating Directives\" - or Mandates - for its trade talks with the United States: one on conformity assessment, (making it easier for companies to prove their products meet technical requirements on both sides of the Atlantic) and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products).\u00a0 The EU Commission published the draft mandates at the same time as submitting them to the EU Member States.\u00a0 These mandates will be discussed and agreed by Member States in Council to ensure that we are satisfied that EU - including Irish - interests are fully represented.<\/p>  <p>At their meeting on 19th   February 2019 the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade (INTA) endorsed the launch of formal trade negotiations with the United States.\u00a0 It is anticipated that a further non-binding plenary vote of the European Parliament will take place on the resolution in March.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>The draft mandates were also discussed at the Informal Trade Ministers Council in Bucharest on 22nd   February 2019.\u00a0 If approved by Member States in Council, the draft mandates should form the basis that will, hopefully, see productive and substantive formal negotiations in these areas commence soon after, which would also see the removal of US steel and aluminium tariffs and the EU rebalancing measures.\u00a0 Additionally, while these negotiations are proceeding both sides are committed to not introducing new tariff measures and if the US were to so do, the proposed mandates make clear that the EU will suspend the negotiations and consider an appropriate and proportionate response. <\/p>  <p>  Consideration of the draft EU mandates is yet to be finalised.\u00a0 However, it is important to note that these two political mandates are of a limited scope, covering two distinct areas agreed on for co-operation in the July 2018 Joint Statement.\u00a0 They do not constitute a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, which would involve negotiations across a wider range of areas such as agriculture and sustainable development among other areas.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is supportive of the EU's intention to commission independent experts to carry out a Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) by the end of 2019 to complement the recent economic analysis released by the EU Commission which found that a targeted EU-US agreement eliminating tariffs on industrial goods would increase EU exports to the US by 8% and US exports to the EU by 9% by 2033. As with the economic analysis, the SIA will inform the EU's negotiating position should negotiations ultimately commence on the topics.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The de-escalation in trade tensions between the US and EU achieved by last July's accord has been of benefit to Irish trade interests and jobs.\u00a0 Equally, a possible future agreement on conformity assessment as well as the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods, would be a positive development to stimulate growth, create employment and continue to grow our economy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current EU Commission plan is to invite Member States to endorse the Negotiating Directives next month. Ireland will determine our final position, in the context of our desire for open, free trade and investment flows between Ireland and the US in support of thousands of jobs, in light of the terms of the Directives once discussions on them have concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700084#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700084#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[9992\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700084#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount of financial state aid-support which will be available from her Department in the event of a no-deal hard Brexit; the provision made in the revised estimates for same; the level of support committed to by the EU Commission; the persons she has met with in relation to state aid for this scenario to date in 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Across Government Departments significant work is ongoing to ensure all necessary supports will be available to enterprise regarding a wide variety of Brexit implications.

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland, following issues which had emerged in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme. <\/p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results; however, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate. The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this specific case. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700086#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700086#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[9951\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700086#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the Spinraza treatment will be made available to SMA suffers in view of the fact it is the only treatment available for this condition and it has been approved funding across Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[9977\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700086#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in the decision to reimburse the drug Spinraza; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[9978\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700086#WRG05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when persons suffering with SMA can expect to receive a decision as to the reimbursement of the drug Spinraza; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 146 and 147 together.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p><p>The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p><p>I am advised by the HSE that an application for the reimbursement of Nusinersen (Spinraza) was considered by HSE Leadership at its meeting on 12 February 2019.<\/p><p>Following detailed consideration of the application, the HSE Leadership made the decision that it was unable to recommend reimbursement of Spinraza and concluded that the evidence for clinical effectiveness is still quite limited and that the current price proposed by the manufacturer was not a cost-effective use of resources.<\/p><p>The HSE has written to the company involved and informed them of the proposal to refuse reimbursement at the current price offering.

Ireland&rsquo;s fish quota management system is designed to ensure the best possible spread both between fishing vessel operators and in terms of take up of quota throughout the year having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions. Many of the  key inshore stocks on which the smaller fishing vessels rely are not limited by quota arrangements, for instance lobster which with crab are  the mainstay for many small boats.  Crab is subject to fishing effort limits (days at sea) set at EU level.     <\/p>  <p>  Quotas are managed based on the Minister's policy. Whitefish quotas are generally managed on a monthly basis and is not based on catch record.  The Minister sets down catch limits for each quota stock following monthly consultation with the Quota Management Advisory Committee involving fishing industry representatives, including the National Inshore Fisheries Forum. The monthly catch limits applicable to whitefish stocks are dependent on the overall length of the vessel (the catch limit of a vessel which is over 55 feet (16.764m) in length overall, is double that of a vessel which is under 55 feet (16.764m) overall). <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of  pelagic stocks which are managed on the basis of the Minister&rsquo;s policy for each stock. The policy for each stock was developed based on divergent criteria taking account of specific circumstances.     There are a number of opportunities for vessels to target  pelagic stocks which are open only to smaller fishing vessels and not based on catch record.    For example, a boat of less than 18m overall length without a mackerel authorisation may avail of the catch limits for mackerel set down in the monthly Fisheries Management Notice for mackerel. The monthly catch limit is recommended by the Quota Management Advisory Committee and is usually set at 5 tonnes.  A boat of less than 15m overall length fishing for mackerel by means of hooks and lines may without a mackerel authorisation, land up to 500kg of mackerel on any occasion.  <\/p>  <p>  Another example is herring stocks in the Celtic Sea.  11% of the national quota for Celtic Sea Herring is set aside for an open fishery.  The fishery is open to boats <17m in length overall, with fishing confined to the \"Dunmore Box\" in the south east. This fishery usually operates from November to the end of the year.

Deer appear to be a localised issue in many areas.  In this context, there is a significant challenge in attempting to ensure that the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation co-exist and that deer populations are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner. <\/p><p>In 2015 my Department, together with the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, published <i>Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action<\/i>, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are abundant. The Irish Deer Management Forum was established to implement the various actions listed in the Report. The Forum comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments.  The Report provides for a review of the workings of the Irish Deer Management Forum after three years.  Both my Department and the Department of Culture Heritage and Gaeltacht are currently examining the future direction of the Forum and its aims in the context of representation on the Forum, agreed work plans and funding mechanisms. <\/p><p>Adoption of best practice is fully supported by both Departments and the majority of deer management stakeholders. Best practice guidance, adapted to Irish Conditions was published by the Irish Deer management Forum during 2018 and can be accessed via www.idmf.ie.<\/p><p>A number of initiatives have been carried out in Co. Wicklow with a view to defining locally-led approaches to cooperative deer management. My Department is currently supporting a project led by the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership and Wicklow Uplands Forum, aimed at improving cooperation between landowners and local hunters. This project builds on previous experience in Wicklow through projects such as the Ballinastoe Deer Management Project, the Calary Deer Steering Group and the Calary\/North&ndash;East Wicklow Deer TB survey. These projects provide a good example for other local groups to follow, in areas affected by deer-related issues.<\/p><p>The Manor Kilbride Deer Management Group in West Wicklow has also produced very useful and practical code of practice for landowners, to guide successful deer management implementation on farmland, and to formalise agreements between landowners and hunters. <\/p><p>Through the Irish Deer Management Forum, Teagasc and a number of other stakeholders have agreed to examine methodologies for to measure the impact of deer in agriculture, and to improve awareness of deer issues and mitigation options among farmers. <\/p><p>My Department introduced a Deer Fencing and Tree Shelter Scheme to protect forests from predation by deer in 2018 as deer can cause serious damage to trees, particularly in native woodlands. Additionally, my Department has also engaged with the Society of Irish Foresters, Teagasc and Third Level Institutes in the delivery of deer management training to professional Foresters and Contractors.<\/p><p>Deer Hunter Licencing and Competence are matters for the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht and the representative bodies, clubs and associations for licenced hunters within the State.<\/p><p>The management of the Coillte forest estate  is a matter for, and the responsibility of, the company as a commercial State Body. The questions in relation to same have therefore been referred to Coillte for direct response to the Deputy within 10 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700087#WRH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700087#WRH03000"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[9836\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700087#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when GLAS payments for a person (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS 2 with a contract commencement date of 1 January 2016 and has received all payments in respect of scheme years 2016 and 2017.<\/p>  <p>  An issue arose in relation to the request by the applicant for a transfer of the GLAS contract which has delayed the 2018 Advance payment.

Consultations would also have to take place with the landowners and turbary right holders, if any.<\/p>  <p>  For the larger plot of land, referred to in the Deputy's Question,  a further phase of concentrated geophysical and hydrological investigations is required to assess the level of risk of peat failure (bog burst) if domestic turf cutting would take place in this area. I understand that contractors, engaged by my Department, would be available to commence those investigations from next month.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that these two areas would appear to have sufficient capacity to accommodate those who would still wish to cut turf for domestic purposes within the special area of conservation. <\/p>  <p>  Officals from my Department as well as contractors engaged by it are willing to continue to liaise with the Deputy and local turf cutter representatives in relation to this issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022700090#WRL05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
