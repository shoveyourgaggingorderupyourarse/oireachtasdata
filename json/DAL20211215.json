Since then, we have had a number of delays and the pandemic has, understandably, focused attention elsewhere.  However, at this stage, it is important for us to get an update.  The assistant Garda commissioner said at the time that he was working towards opening a Garda station in the near future.  This is important, not just because there have been ongoing issues in the wider region which have been brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice by me and others for quite a number of years but also because any new or expanding community needs basic community infrastructure.  Communities need schools, libraries and all of the facilities available to every other community, and at the heart of that would be a Garda station.  The site has been identified, the assistant Garda commissioner has said that he is working towards it and the Minister for Justice said the same in June 2019.

I understand he has been to Castletownshend, so he will be very familiar with how picturesque it is down there.  Castletownshend, to paint the picture, is a coastal village just east of Skibbereen and is one of the most picturesque locations in Ireland, I would say.  It is a beautiful village with a 17th century castle and looks over a beautiful inlet, one of the most stunning inlets along the Cork coast.  It also has the very famous Mary Ann's restaurant that attracts people from far and wide.  Walking down the village you pass that 17th century castle on the left-hand side and come to the pier with what look like pristine waters, and then at the pier there is a big \"no bathing\" sign.  The reason the \"no bathing\" sign is there is that, despite the beautiful, picturesque village I have described, what you also have there is raw sewage being pumped into water into the inlet.  I went to see it last week to get another look and excrement is clearly to be seen going out into the water.<\/p>  <p>  It is one of many villages around the coast that have this problem.  It relies heavily on tourism, as does much of the region, and the least the people there deserve is a proper, functioning wastewater treatment plant.  The first part of my question is to look for an update on the status of that project?  I understand it is supposed to be forthcoming but is there funding for it?  When can we expect to see work commence on a wastewater treatment plant for Castletownshend?  What are the timelines?<\/p>  <p>  While I am on issue of raw excrement, I have to bring up the problems being faced by the population in Shannonvale.  Shannonvale is a village close to Clonakilty.  Some would consider them to be the same town.  Shannonvale is just outside Clonakilty.  This issue has often been brought up in this Chamber.  There are many young families in Shannonvale with many young children.  There is a children's play area which for the past number of years has been cordoned off because raw sewage is coming up through the ground.  It is clear for everyone to see.  It has been acknowledged by the council and by Irish Water but we are no closer to understanding when that issue will be solved.  The Topical Issue matter relates to the Castletownshend issue so I fully understand if the Minister of State does not have an answer.  I have spoken to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien time and again about this.  I ask the Minister of State in his communications with Irish Water to stress the importance of resolving this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500004#B00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1639560120,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As a Kilkenny man, I am very fond of west Cork.  It is a part of the country I am very familiar with.  On the issue in Castletownshend, it is simply unacceptable that we have raw sewage discharging into watercourses.  It is something this Government is determined to address.  We have had a number of these issues raised consistently by Deputies.  We need to make significant progress over the next number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water service planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level, including investment in wastewater treatment plants and returning wastewater safely to the environment in an efficient and sustainable manner.  The prioritisation and progression of individual projects is a matter for determination by Irish Water.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is a key statutory body for the investigation of complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in regard to licensed urban wastewater discharges.  The EPA's recent report on urban wastewater shows that while many serious challenges remain, Irish Water is continuing to make progress and is improving performance of our wastewater systems.  Irish Water has reduced the number of priority wastewater sites listed by the EPA, it has increased the number of large towns and cities that now meet the required EU standards for wastewater discharges, and it continues to reduce the number of towns and villages discharging untreated wastewater.<\/p>  <p>  However, while there is still a long complex of work lying ahead for Irish Water, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I are eager to see faster progress on the delivery of projects wherever this is possible.  As part of budget 2022 the Minister secured funding of more than &euro;1.57 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.459 billion comprising current expenditure of &euro;629 million and capital expenditure of &euro;830 million in respect of domestic water service provision by Irish Water.  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies throughout Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in rivers, lakes and marine areas.  This is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and wastewater infrastructure, including compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in regard to Castletownshend, I understand from Irish Water that planning permission for the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant and network infrastructure was granted in November and works will commence in 2022.  While ensuring wastewater discharging into Castlehaven meets appropriate discharge standards, this new plant will also bring benefits to Castletownshend in terms of health, integrity of the environment and improved water quality for all.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the issue raised by the Deputy on Shannonvale, again, that is unacceptable.

That is a very positive development in regard to Castletownshend.  Obviously we knew the planning permission has been granted, but that we can expect work to commence in 2022 will bring much solace to the people of Castletownshend, business people and residents alike.<\/p>  <p>  In my remaining time I have another Irish Water related issue to raise regarding my home town of Clonakilty.  I know the Minister of State is a big fan of Clonakilty and visits it regularly.  Clonakilty is one of the main towns in west Cork.  It has a population of about 5,000 people.  It is my home town.  It is earmarked for growth of about 36% as one of the key towns in County Cork.  In regard to development in Clonakilty at the moment, however, Irish Water's position is that it will not allow development of more than one house in the town.  It will not allow water connection for any estate of 20, 30 or even 50 houses.  Therefore development cannot take place.  To put that in context, the demand for and price of housing in that area, like everywhere else, is skyrocketing.  Availability of premises to rent is non-existent.  There is nowhere left to rent.<\/p> <p>Our aim as a Government is to deliver 33,000 homes per annum but in a town the size of Clonakilty we are only allowing the development of one house.  This flies in the face of what we are trying to achieve.  I do not expect the Minister of State to be familiar with the exact details of this case.  Irish Water has indicated a period of five to seven years will be needed for an interim solution.  That is far too long for anybody who is looking for a house in the Clonakilty area.  I ask again that the Department intervene and instruct Irish Water to find a better interim solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500004#B00600","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639560720,"counter":19,"content":"<p>As I said, the experience across the country is that small towns that are primed for growth are being held back because of a lack of adequate infrastructure.

There are other issues with Irish Water in terms of moving towards a single public utility, with local authorities and the work that has to be done with the Workplace Relations Commission.  Notwithstanding that, it is critically important that we move swiftly and with determination to ensure that these towns have the capacity to be able to develop and grow their local economies and to support families who want to settle in them.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, this is an issue across the country.  I know that the Deputy has an interest in water quality generally and in the wetlands.  From that point of view, we want to ensure the next cycle of river basin management plans are supported by adequate infrastructure to deal with wastewater discharge into water courses across the country.  I will follow up on the specific issues raised in this Topical Issue matter with regard to Castletownshend.

This report was published by the Department of Social Protection.  Based on the very modest and incremental increases of just &euro;5 across most welfare payments for 2022, it is understandable that I and others are not holding out hope for a fully resourced cost of disability payment to appear, as if by magic, next year.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Department of Health are discharged with the lion's share of the &euro;2.2 billion disability budget, yet most of the extra costs incurred by disabled people are essential services and supports that the HSE, technically and in policy, provides, but in reality does not.  Day in and day out, I am hearing from people on the ground about their struggles, worries, stress and pressures.  The report shows that having a disability can cost anywhere between &euro;9,500 and &euro;12,000 extra per annum.  It is a little reductive to celebrate the publication of a report that is telling us what we already know and what the experts in direct lived experience have been shouting about from the rooftops for decades.  This year we have had the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report and activists and advocates sounding the alarm that disabled people are more at risk of fuel poverty, unemployment, mental illness, lack of access to adequate housing and transport and, therefore, exposure to inadequate housing and many other deprivation factors.<\/p>  <p>  How will this report inform future disability services policy for 2022?  Will another year pass where we feel we have to accept that many disabled people, between means testing and limited earnings, are stuck in a poverty and dependency cycle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500005#C00400","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speech","time":1639560720,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the Indecon report on the cost of disability, which was published last week after months of waiting.  We were informed last summer that this report was completed.  It is regrettable it was not presented to the Government prior to budget 2022 as it might have influenced how spending on disability would be managed in the coming year.  I hope the next few months are used wisely to consider the findings in the report and how best to address them as the year progresses and that budget 2023 will reflect these findings.<\/p>  <p>  The report confirms what was widely known but frequently not acknowledged, namely, that there is a significant cost of disability.  The cost of disability is the extra spending a person with a disability must face in dealing with day-to-day life that able-bodied people do not have to face.  It is what a family with a member who has a disability must spend to achieve the same standard living as that of a family without a member with a disability.  People with disabilities have extra costs such as taxi expenses, particularly in rural areas where there are few, if any, public transport options and these are frequently not accessible where they are available, and extra fuel and energy costs, especially where the person is not mobile.  They also require adaptations to properties, specialised footwear, assistive technology, additional medication and so on.  Unfortunately, many of the services that should be provided in the community through the HSE or other organisations sanctioned by the HSE are non-existent and, again, families must pay privately for these supports.<\/p>  <p>  The report states that the average additional cost of disability for a person with a severe disability is between &euro;9,600 and &euro;12,300 per annum.  For those with a less severe disability, it is between &euro;8,700 and &euro;10,000 per annum.  That is an average cost.  Some people are paying less but there are many who are paying considerably more.  The cost is dependent on the level of severity of the disability, but also where the person resides.  There are unmet costs for many because some things are not currently affordable.  How is the Government preparing to address the findings of this report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500005#C00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1639560720,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue today.  The cost of disability can be measured by the costs faced by people with a disability in their day-to-day lives that others in society do not face, that is, the direct costs approach.  It can also be measured by the amount of additional income a household containing a person with a disability would require to achieve the same standard of living as a comparable household that does not contain a person with a disability, that is, the equivalence approach.<\/p>  <p>  To get a better understanding of these costs and the way they affect people differently, the Department of Social Protection commissioned Indecon International Research Economists to conduct an independent cost of disability study.  As the Deputies will be aware, the report was published by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, on 7 December.  There is no one single or typical cost of disability, but rather a range of costs from very low to extremely high depending on a person's individual circumstances.  Indecon estimates this range, using both a cost studies method and an equivalence approach.  The cost studies method is based on over 4,734 responses to a survey of people with disabilities.  The equivalence approach applies econometric techniques to data from the annual survey of income and living conditions from the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>  <p>  Indecon estimated that the overall average annual costs of disability in Ireland ranges from &euro;9,482 to &euro;11,734 per annum.  The report recommends that additional costs of disability should be addressed through a multifaceted approach, involving increased cash payments, enhanced access to service provision and specific targeted grant programmes.  It also recommends that disability payment levels should reflect the very different costs that arise according to the type and severity of disability.  Furthermore, the concentration of any additional supports should be targeted at those most in need and facing the greatest additional costs of disability.  The report also highlights that increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities should be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  The analysis has clearly shown that extra costs of disability are incurred across a wide range of areas and can include expenditure such as medicines, care and assistance, equipment, aids and appliances, transport and mobility, costs of social engagement, home adaptation and day-to-day expenses on items like food and home heating.  The research clearly shows that there is no one cost, but rather a spectrum of costs that varies across a number of dimensions, including the age of the individual, the severity of disability, as well as the nature of the disability and household type.  While some of the costs reported through the survey are already met by the State, it is clear there is a lot more to do.  It is also clear that further improvements cannot be delivered through income supports alone but require a broader perspective covering areas such as employment, housing, transport, education and health.<\/p> <p>Without a doubt there will be important implications for public policy and service delivery for individuals living with a disability.  There is no quick-fix solution here, but the Government is being proactive and will not be found wanting when it comes to actioning this report.  It may take some time to address the various issues and cannot be done over the course of just one budget.<\/p> <p> I am going to take the Deputies through the next steps of what exactly is being planned.

One of the things that struck me from the report is that Ireland is fourth from the bottom of the list of 31 countries where the percentage of our social protection budget is the lowest when dealing with disability supports.  The level of payment and allowances to disabled people must be increased if we are to end the exclusion and risk of poverty for disabled people in this country.  However, as the Minister of State said, as well as increased payments, there is also a need for better services and supports.  The number of disabled people out of work is one of the highest in Europe, as my colleague has just mentioned, and measures to address that are needed.  We need to support people to support themselves.  This means more education and training opportunities to enable people to access employment and the provision of more employment opportunities.  Personalised budgets are where we are going to have to go if we are to allow people the choice of how and where they live their lives and so on.  A complete change of mindset is required such that people with disabilities are not seen as people to be pitied or to be cared for.  They need to be seen as people with lives to live and choices to make about how to live that life, so we need to implement the UNCRPD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500006#D00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1639561320,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On the next step, I am happy to inform the Deputies and the House that the report has now been referred to the NDIS steering group, which I chair.  This group will then consider what actions are needed.  The NDIS steering group, which is meeting later this morning, will hear from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and me as well as Indecon, which will make a presentation of its findings.  When we talk about what makes up the NDIS, it is made up of disability stakeholder group, DSG, 5 but I have also invited the new members coming forward for DSG 6.  They are not starting until January but I have invited them to sit in so I do not have to rerun the report again and we can hit the ground running.  It also includes every other Department, and there is a junior or senior Minister.  They all sit within it.  There is a very good selection of people, Departments and representatives.  The Independent Living Movement Ireland will be there today.  There is the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Intellectual Disability, FEDVOL, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, other disabled people's organisations, DPOs, and myriad more to give a cross-section of people who are advocates and strong voices of representation there.  On the other side will be the Departments that will take responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth year iteration of the DSG finishes up this month and the sixth is taking its position from January.  This will undoubtedly be the first piece of work the incoming group undertakes.  Importantly, by utilising the NDIS steering group, I can ensure the key actors across Government and the wider public sector incorporate the findings of the cost of disability report into their work.  That is what the job is.  This report now becomes part of every Department to ensure they disability-proof their budgets.  As part of it we will set out some of our action frameworks from all the Departments, so when we come back in March, we will have a plan and a pathway for how to action, implement and sculpt future policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500006#D00400","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","time":1639561320,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500006#D00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1639561320,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an &aacute;bhair seo a roghn&uacute;.

It is dearly loved there.  It was a nursing home and is currently a day centre.  It was at the top of everybody's list.  I had the privilege of collecting 22,000 signatures to keep the nursing home open.  We failed to keep it open but managed to keep the day centre open.  On the very week it closed, there was an announcement from Government that we did not have enough public nursing homes, and we know the result of that when we look at Covid.<\/p><p>Today it is a day centre.  The capacity is much bigger than the numbers currently attending, given Covid.  I am focusing on the kitchen, the chef and the team who are there for more than 20 years supplying healthy food, not only to the people attending the day centre but equally to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in Merlin Park.  As the Minister of State knows, CAMHS, deals with many eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia and so on.  Here we have a kitchen that is fantastic and a team that is superb.  It appears the HSE in its wisdom, or lack thereof, has made a decision to close the kitchen and outsource the catering facilities.  The staff have been informed.<\/p><p>It is appalling and I hope the Minister of State can do something about this for many reasons.  First, it is an excellent service.  It has won awards over the years.  Second, as I said, it supplies meals not only to the day centre but also to CAMHS.  Third, if we have learned anything from Covid and climate change, it is that we need to go back and go local and to take the power back.  Here is a perfect service.  If we allow this to go, it is going to happen all over the country.  The kitchen is serving meals in a sustainable and healthy way.  I will read fromthe Mental Health Commission's latest inspection reportof CAMHS in relation to food.  It is compliant of course, because of St Francis Nursing Home and the chef and his small team:<\/p> <blockquote> \tResidents were provided with a variety of wholesome and nutritious food in the approved centre.  Food was properly prepared and comprised of servings from different food groups as per the Food Pyramid.  Residents received at least two choices for meals. <\/blockquote>  <p>It goes on to talk about water and the needs of residents being identified in the care plan.  My point is the food is excellent.  It has been recognised externally with awards over the years.<\/p><p>The decision would seem to have been made without any analysis of the risks involved or the consequences.  When the letters were sent out, they had to be changed subsequently to make the decision process correct.  However, I will leave that for the staff and unions.  My concern relates to an excellent service.<\/p><p>I ask that the Minister of State looks at this.  Why is the HSE doing it?  It is doing so because extra clinical space or offices are needed.  The centre has many possibilities.  It is big enough to give extra space but not to get rid of a fully functioning, fully equipped kitchen that is providing an excellent service.  In fact, if the HSE was to look at it, perhaps the services could even be extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500006#D00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1639561320,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for bringing this to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I will read into the record her response, or some of it anyway.  I happen to know St Francis Nursing Home.  It is important for me to put that on record as well.  I am aware of the work that goes on there.<\/p> <p>I am further aware that when we have a service that is working and functioning, sometimes we should think twice before we try to break it.<\/p> <p> Day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities.  The reopening of these centres is a priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.<\/p> <p> The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering health and personal social services.  The reopening of day care centres for older people has commenced following their necessary closure last year.  The HSE continues to actively work on the resumption of these vital services as a priority in line with current public health guidance.  At the end of October, approximately 200 centres for older people had reopened and I am pleased to say that the St. Francis day service reopened in early October.  To be honest, Deputy Connolly advocated seriously for the reopening of day services as well.<\/p> <p> The HSE has decided that the space used for catering at the St. Francis centre will be dedicated to clinical space for enhanced community care including integrated care for older persons and day care.  This will support older people to have their needs met within the community, benefiting from a multidisciplinary team and working towards providing them with the right care in the right place at the right time.  Recruitment is currently under way for most of the posts required.<\/p> <p> In addition to the St. Francis centre being proposed as a clinical space for integrated care for older persons, there are a number of other primary care services also planned for the centre that will provide services to the community in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and enhanced community care.  The HSE has assured the Department that day services for older people will continue to run in the St. Francis centre as part of the new configuration.<\/p> <p> The continued enhancement and improvement of our mental health and suicide prevention services remains a priority for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and for the Government as a whole.  She was pleased to secure unprecedented funding of &euro;1.149 billion for HSE mental health services next year.  This is an increase of &euro;47 million over 2021, and will enable the continued implementation of Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy, including important recommendations relating to CAMHS.  Next year's new development funding will provide for the recruitment of 350 new staff across mental health and will allow for new initiatives in community mental health teams, including CAMHS, CAMHS telehubs, out-of-hours supports, specialist eating disorder services and mental health services for older people.<\/p> <p> In the remaining time, it is important to address the question Deputy Connolly asked, which is why we are closing a kitchen that is professionally run by a chef that supports the needs of older people within the community.  It also provides a meals-on-wheels service.  I am no different to you, Acting Chairman, in that I am from a rural constituency.  We know the value of a day service which some people attend one or two days a week, but they might take home meals for another two days.  Such provision of care is important.  I could perhaps take up the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on behalf of Deputy Connolly.  It may be something we need to take up at a local level with Breda Crehan-Roche to have a clear understanding of the exact decision process involved and to see if it is possible to preserve the kitchen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500006#D00700","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639561920,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for finally addressing my question, which is about a review.  I realise she is stepping in for somebody else, but services for older people and mental health overlap as well.  I got a page with the reply, and other than the middle part that tells me there is a reconfiguration, I got a hymn of praise to the amount of money provided.  I know the Ministers are working hard.  I have said that.  I am not going to waste my precious time on that, but on the very bad decision to close a wonderful kitchen, which is fully equipped and where the chef has been there for more than 20 years.  There is a lovely and very competent team supplying healthy food where we have control and see what is happening.  There is quality food and no worries about anything.  In addition, the kitchen complies with the special needs of CAMHS in Merlin Park.  What kind of idiotic management - I put it as strongly as that - makes a decision to close a fully equipped kitchen instead of analysing it to see how it could be further extended?  Further on in the reply, insult is added to injury by referring to the crisis caf&eacute;.  We have a full restaurant kitchen supplying wonderful meals and we are getting rid of it.<\/p>  <p>  In reply to my question, I got a whole load of stuff that is nothing to do with it.  It is Christmas time and I want to be positive.  I wish everyone a happy Christmas.  This is a day centre that is crucial.  Food is a crucial part of psychology.  It is not just about eating healthy food, but sitting down together and eating a meal.  A ridiculous decision was made a few years ago on the L&aacute; Nua centre, where the lunches were taken away.  I urge the Minister of State to help if she has any influence.  It is time to stop the sweet words, to show vision and leadership and to say this is nuts.  It is simply not acceptable.  There may be a need to reorganise and restructure but we should not get rid of a vital service.  We must learn from it.  The service has been complimented by the Mental Health Commission.  We must look at how it operates and how we can extend it.

I sincerely thank them all for their support of this Bill.  We are here to move the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021.  It is my understanding that the Government has now submitted an amendment to the Bill, which will deny us the opportunity of it being read again.  This is profoundly disappointing, given that it is such a reasonable Bill.  I also strongly state that I hope, and it is only reasonable to expect, that the issue of pain relief will be discussed as part of the review into abortion services.  It is something that cannot be left out and must form part of that review.  I insist on that.  I acknowledge the positive cross-party engagement from Deputies and Senators in these Houses.  For that reason, and for humane reasons, it is important that pain relief is discussed in the review of abortion services.<\/p><p>The main objective of this Bill is contained in section 3.  If accepted, a new provision would be inserted into the 2018 Act requiring pain relief to be administered to an unborn child, where appropriate, in the minority of cases to which that section applies.  The section also makes clear that pain relief is not required to be administered in emergency cases where it may not be practicable.  I emphasise that we bring this Bill forward in a spirit of constructive engagement.  I hope that colleagues will be open to hearing what we have to say and that they will approach this Bill with a view to being guided by the science around foetal pain.  More science has come to light in the past few years and, indeed, recent developments have taken place.<\/p><p>In this regard, I will highlight the short report on foetal pain published by the Oireachtas life and dignity group.  The report pointed to a major review of the scientific literature on foetal pain that was published in the influential <i>Journal of Medical Ethics<\/i>in 2020.  In the article, Professor Stuart Derbyshire and Dr. John Bockmann state that research indicates unborn babies might be able to feel &quot;something like pain&quot; as early as 13 weeks.  It might be noted that the lead author of the review was Professor Derbyshire, who had previously acted as a consultant to the largest abortion provider in the US, Planned Parenthood.  In 2006, he wrote in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>that not talking to women seeking abortions about pain experienced by unborn babies was &quot;sound policy based on good evidence that fetuses cannot experience pain.&quot;  However, on foot of his latest review, he states that &quot;it is now clear that the [2006] consensus is no longer [scientifically] tenable.&quot;  The authors went on to note that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tGiven the evidence that the fetus might be able to experience something like pain during later abortions, it seems reasonable that the clinical team and the pregnant woman are encouraged to consider fetal ... [pain relief]. <\/blockquote>  <p>The life and dignity group report also highlighted the fact that foetal surgeons who perform operations on unborn babies look upon them as their patients.  As a result, pain relief medication is routinely administered as standard medical practice.  Indeed, one leading children's hospital in the United States performed nearly 1,600 foetal surgeries between 1995 and June 2017.  Perinatal medicine now treats unborn babies as young as 18 weeks for dozens of conditions where every care is taken not to inflict pain or cause distress to the unborn baby.  In 2019, in a reply to a parliamentary question from Sir Edward Leigh MP, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in the UK confirmed that unborn babies receiving recently announced innovative spinal surgery will, as a matter of course, receive pain relief during the procedure.<\/p><p>We are seeking today for the law in this State to reflect a similar precautionary approach, which is reasonable and humane.  We already do so in legislation governing animal welfare.  In fact, the law demands that this humane approach is reflected in regulatory guidelines dealing with animal welfare.  This is only right and proper.  For our part, we cannot simply rely on an approach that states it is for medical guidelines alone to deal with such matters.  While that position can have some merit, for certain important issues it remains a totally artificial legislative construct that we must overcome.  We have all kinds of patient-centred legislation that mandates, where appropriate, how our hospitals and healthcare system should operate.  We demand the implementation of certain standards and we make laws to ensure that those standards become a reality.  In this light, for us to continue insisting that the Government must have no hand, act or part in shaping a principled approach to medical guidelines is simply not sustainable.<\/p> <p>This is particularly true for approaches to dealing with pain relief.  Abortions, particularly late-term abortions, are highly emotive issues.  We know they are happening already in this State.  We know doctors who perform them are highly conflicted and sometimes physically traumatised, as the UCC study made clear.  That study was informed by medical professionals.<\/p> <p> We must take the lead here.  There is a duty and onus on us to do so as legislators who are determined to insert a modicum of compassion into an already sufficiently traumatising experience.  We must not abdicate our responsibility as legislators by continuing to insist the issue of pain relief for unborn children is none of our business and will never be our business.  How can we maintain that fiction?  How long must we wait until our laws in this area are informed by the best available evidence and science?  As the Bill's sponsors, we have strong views about that.  However, we want to be clear that this Bill will apply in circumstances where the baby has progressed to 20 weeks gestation.  In that sense, while the principle of the Bill is critical, it must also be narrow and limited in its terms, approach and application.  We hope this warrants widespread cross-party support to enable the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage where the issues can be conscientiously teased out through further analysis.  For these reasons and more, I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500008#F00200","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639563120,"counter":41,"content":"<p>As we debate this Bill, some Deputies may be asking or telling themselves that the matter of foetal pain relief is more suited to medical guidelines than primary legislation.  I am sure many of my D&aacute;il colleagues remember that when similar amendments were proposed three years ago, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, refused them.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe purpose of this legislation is not to regulate or dictate the practice of obstetrics. [...] There is a very thin line that we should not cross where we move from being policy makers to being doctors.  <\/blockquote>  <p>However, it is interesting to note that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 mandates &quot;the use of an appropriate anaesthetic... [to animals] to prevent or relieve any pain during... [an] operation or procedure.&quot;  I wonder whether there have been any concerns about those 2013 legislators?  Have any of them moved from being policymakers to being vets yet?<\/p><p>There are other reasons it may not be prudent or ethical to repeat the mantra that we should trust doctors unquestioningly on the topic of foetal pain relief.  It is clear that, despite having had three years to do so, there are as yet no guidelines around the administration of anaesthesia during abortion procedures.  That is despite the fact we know that late-term abortions are being performed in Ireland, that foetal pain is likely experienced much earlier in pregnancy than previously thought and that two extremely brutal abortion methods are being used during late-term abortions in Ireland, namely, D&amp;amp;E or dismemberment abortions and foeticide involving lethal injection.  If anyone is in doubt about why pain relief may be required during a late-term abortion procedure, I recommend they look up what is involved in these two procedures.  A good starting point is the report on late-term abortions and foetal pain produced by the all-party Oireachtas life and dignity group.  It is easily available for anyone to view at <i>www.lifeanddignity.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>In addition to the fact that there is no sign of these medical guidelines, there is another factor that must be considered when suggesting simply deferring to doctors.  This was addressed in the 2019 article in the <i>Journal of Medical Ethics<\/i>entitled &quot;Reconsidering fetal pain&quot;.  This article is noteworthy because its two authors, Stuart Derbyshire and John Bockmann, came together to address the evidence for foetal pain despite having very different views on the morality of abortion.  They noted that it appeared that the only procedures where invasive foetal intervention proceeds without anaesthesia are abortions.  The article states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... all the evidence suggests that surgeons performing therapeutic fetal interventions routinely consider pain relief for the fetus, [while] surgeons performing abortions have their focus on the pregnant woman as their patient.  Consequently they more rarely consider fetal pain relief during the preparation and execution of abortion <\/blockquote>  <p>It is not unreasonable to conclude that, perhaps unsurprisingly, medics who choose to perform procedures intended to end the life of a foetus may have a blind spot when it comes to considering the welfare of the foetus during those procedures.<\/p><p>William Wilberforce stated &quot;you [might be able to turn and] look the other way but you can never again say [that] you did not know.&rdquo;  I ask Deputies to help us to end this injustice and support this Bill.  We are discussing a legislative proposal and it is easy to get caught up in the legal jargon and technicalities; however, it is important to remember that at the core of this Bill we are asking whether the House is prepared to support a measure to help to avoid unnecessary pain being inflicted on vulnerable human beings.<\/p><p>If Members care about compassion, humanity and mercy towards the vulnerable among us, or about following the science, which becomes ever clearer that unborn children are likely to feel pain much earlier than previously believed, I ask them to please support this Bill.  If they care about cruelty to animals, I ask them to please extend the same protection to unborn human beings and support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500009#G00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1639563120,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this important Bill.  This baby pain relief Bill is crucial to ensure that any baby with a heartbeat does not have to endure or feel pain while being aborted or killed and denied the right to make their way into this world.  There are several other pressing problems and issues we should be highlighting on behalf of communities that are let down and under constant attack from the three Government parties.  They concern people who need medical interventions, farmers, hauliers, working-class people whose incomes are diminishing daily and people who cannot even go to work because of Covid.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to be worth our salt in the D&aacute;il, we have to stand up for those who cannot defend or talk up for themselves.  We have to stand up at Christmastime, the time of peace and goodwill, for these defenceless babies.  They are God's creatures who cannot defend themselves.  They have done nothing wrong to anyone.  They were conceived naturally, like each of us, but they are not to be allowed to live.  To top it all, they have to endure pain while they are being discarded from this life.  They are being hurt in the process of ending their little lives.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister and the Government to do everything possible to ensure pain relief is administered to each baby with a beating heart.  I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be only those babies over 20 weeks gestation.  Every baby with a beating heart should not have to feel pain.  There is no difference between a baby over 20 weeks and a baby under 20 weeks.  They are all human beings to me.  God created them, they are alive and they should not be discounted like this.<\/p>  <p>  This has been asked for since abortion was legalised but there has been a refusal to extend a morsel of compassion to these babies as they breathe their last breath in this world.  This is the most forceful and condemning evidence that we are losing our empathy and our way as a society.  <\/p> <p>Recent scientific evidence concludes that unborn babies feel pain as early as 12 weeks and maybe sooner.  To ignore this is reckless.  Indeed, unborn babies that are to be born in the natural way and are going to be allowed to live in the normal way are looked on by baby surgeons as their patients and are administered pain relief medication as standard medical practice.  So there is medical interventions to stop the pain and to numb the pain.<\/p> <p> Pain relief for animals is provided for in primary legislation and properly so.  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides that veterinarians administer pain relief during any procedures or interventions that would cause pain to the animal.  Surely we must ensure that unborn babies with a heartbeat are dealt with in a compassionate way and give them pain relief.  If there is any humanity in the Government I ask why it is putting down an amendment to a Bill as harmless as this.  Is it just because it wants to oppose ordinary people who want to stop children, little babies, having pain in this way?  It is such a small thing to ask.  We should be asking that they be let live but at this stage, because of the abortion laws that were passed, this is all we can ask for.  We are asking for more heart, that the Government does what we ask and please help little babies that have done nothing wrong to anyone in this world.  If the Government does not help these, I cannot see how it will help anyone at all that it is supposed to be helping while its members are in government.  There were 6,666 children aborted in the first year after the legislation was changed.  These little children are an awful loss to our country and to our community.  I had the pleasure of having a young granddaughter, Br&iacute;d Healy-Rae, five weeks ago.  To think that anyone would harm her or cause her pain would drive me down through the ground.  I have five grandchildren and I adore each and every one of them.<\/p> <p> We need to do more to help mothers, and fathers, indeed, to ensure there is another way.  We are not doing that.  Many here were hell-bent on ensuring that the abortion legislation went through.  That was their right and for those who voted for it that was their right.  But that is not to say that I say it is right.  I think that these children, if they grew up, and they do grow up and they are not long becoming men and women, would have been a massive asset to this country.  The Government, by its amendment, is looking to delay this.  I want to remind the Minister that 18 babies are being aborted daily so they are going to suffer pain.  It is 126 weekly and over 6,000 in a year.  Surely we should not be wasting time.  Is there humanity in the Minister or any of the Government?  If there is, now is the time to stand up and do what we ask which is just to administer pain relief in the course of these abortions where we are ending little babies lives.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500009#G00400","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639563720,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021 a second reading in order to allow for the review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 to conclude and for its recommendations to be considered.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputies for tabling their amendment and acknowledge their legitimacy and genuine views.  As for the current approach of allowing this review to progress and make recommendations back to me, the Government, the Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on Health, I would be applying the same approach whether this was a Bill seeking to make the Act more conservative or more liberal.  That is important.<\/p><p>I will explain why the amendment is necessary at this time.  Following the referendum in 2018, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was signed into law in late December 2018 and commenced on 1 January 2019.  Services for termination of pregnancy are delivered in both community and hospital settings and are designed to provide a safe and effective service for both service users and service providers.  The Private Member's Bill before the House today proposes to amend the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 to direct the model of care for service delivery.  A first reading of the Bill appears to suggest that the obligation on the medical practitioner to administer anaesthetic to the foetus would apply mainly for terminations after 20 weeks' gestation.  However, the new section 12A(1)(b) appears to apply to terminations at any stage of pregnancy. <\/p><p>I need not remind the House of the result of the referendum held on the 36th amendment of the Constitution on 25 May 2018.  The provisions set out in the Act also reflect recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, based on its consideration of the report produced by the Citizens' Assembly on the issue.  No recommendations were made by the joint committee or by the Citizens' Assembly on medical procedures or clinical practice around termination of pregnancy.  The purpose of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is to set out the grounds on which termination of pregnancy is lawful in Ireland.  Its purpose is not to dictate clinical practice on the area nor to set out the medical procedures to be used by medical practitioners carrying out a termination of pregnancy. <\/p><p>Detailed work was undertaken by the relevant medical colleges during late 2018 and early 2019 to develop comprehensive clinical guidelines to assist medical practitioners in the clinical decision-making involved in dealing with these cases.  This clinical guidance was a key component of the delivery of an integrated service.  I am advised that the medical colleges are working on reviewing the clinical guidance documents and where necessary, they will update them according to the latest evidence and international best practice in the area.  Care pathways, treatment plans and best medical practice in these sometimes complicated cases are best developed by medical experts and set out in these clinical guidance documents.  It would not be appropriate for legislation to dictate clinical practice in a medical or healthcare setting.  However, section 7 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 requires the operation of the Act to be reviewed.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that this review commenced last week on 8 December.  The review clause was included in the 2018 Act in order to facilitate monitoring of the impact, operation and effectiveness of the legislation in practice, as well as on the delivery of services in this area.  Deputy Nolan asked an important question in the context of this morning's debate as to whether all the issues being raised by her and those tabling this Bill and any of those participating in today&rsquo;s debate can be considered.  I acknowledge these issues are important to the Deputies and all can be raised within the review which is being commenced.  <\/p><p>Phase 1 of the review will capture the information on the effectiveness and operation of the Act from the perspective of the women who access the service, health professionals who deliver the service and the public.  The latter may also include service users and service providers.  The review will be informed by three important streams of information in order to examine whether the operation of the legislation is appropriate and effective.  First, and I think most importantly, women's experience of termination of pregnancy services and their views on how the system has operated since 1 January 2019 will be a critical source of information for the review.  This stream will draw on the large-scale qualitative research study commissioned by the HSE's sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  This is to investigate unplanned pregnancy and abortion care.  The research is being led by Dr. Catherine Conlon, assistant professor in the department of social studies in the school of social work and social policy in Trinity College Dublin.<\/p> <p>The study will generate an indepth understanding of the experiences of women who have accessed unplanned pregnancy support services and abortion care services since the implementation of the Act.  Other relevant peer-reviewed research on women's experiences published since 2019 will also be considered.<\/p> <p> Second, the review will gather the views of those involved in providing termination of pregnancy services in community and acute settings in Ireland.  Independent qualitative research on the service provider perspective was uploaded on eTenders, the Government procurement process, last week.  The service providers' research will include input from hospitals and GP services providing termination of pregnancy services.  It will include input from individual medical practitioners, medical colleges, midwives, counsellors and other relevant service providers who may wish to partake and be identified.  The review will also draw on other relevant peer-reviewed research on service providers' experience of implementing the Act since 2019.<\/p> <p> Third, a public consultation was launched to provide an opportunity for members of the public, interest groups or other interested parties to submit their views for consideration in the review.  The second phase of the review will be led by an independent chair who will assess the extent to which the objectives of the Act have been achieved, analysing in that regard the findings of the three strands of information on the operation of the Act.  The chair will assess the extent to which the Act's objectives have not been achieved and make recommendations to address any barriers identified.<\/p> <p> The chair will also draw on the findings of other relevant peer-reviewed research and consult further with stakeholders as necessary before providing conclusions and any recommendations to me later next year.  I will share that with the Government.  I have already discussed it in detail with the Joint Committee on Health and will share it with colleagues in the Oireachtas too.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I think and hope we can all agree that the best people to make decisions about the most appropriate treatment in healthcare are the treating medical practitioners.  Notwithstanding this, as I recently commenced a review of the operation and effectiveness of the provisions of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, at this point, it is necessary to decline to give this Private Member's Bill a Second Reading.  We need to allow the review to be completed and for its recommendations to be considered.  Let us see what those recommendations may be.  They may be operational.  There may be recommendations relating to regulation or the Act itself.  Those who would seek to change the Act or service provision in any direction, whether to be more conservative or more liberal, need to give the review the space it needs to do its work and report back to us so that we can take appropriate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500010#H00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639564320,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have co-sponsored and to speak today in favour of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021.  I strongly believe in the principles of this important legislation.  It is rooted in caring principles of avoiding unnecessary pain and suffering.  This Bill would ensure that pain relief medicine is provided to unborn babies in late-term abortion situations.  This Bill should be judged on its specific merits and not as a replay of the 2018 abortion referendum.  At present, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 does not include provisions which ensure that pain relief medicine is provided to unborn children in abortions.  Late-term abortions are happening after 12 weeks across Ireland under several circumstances set out in the 2018 Act.  This is the primary cause of concern as recent scientific and medical evidence details that unborn children in late-term abortions have developed significantly enough to experience pain.  The most recent scientific evidence indicates that unborn babies have the capacity to feel something like pain from 12 weeks of gestation.<\/p>  <p>  As revealed in the 2020 article by Professor Stuart Derbyshire and John Bockmann, there exists significant literature which has long asserted that, from 20 weeks or earlier, unborn babies can feel.  Recognising this reality, many countries have introduced foetal pain relief for unborn babies, such as prior to spina bifida surgery.  In France, 97% of late-term abortions are performed with the inclusion of pain relief medicine.  This compelling scientific evidence has led me to conclude that there is a sufficient basis to claim that unborn babies experience pain during late-term abortions.  Scientific arguments debate the exact time at which babies can experience pain.  The introduction of precautionary measures to eliminate the potential altogether is a wise provision.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that this Bill should be judged on its specific merits and not be a replay of the 2018 abortion referendum.  Following that referendum, a clause was inserted in the Constitution that the Oireachtas may legislate for issues relating to unborn children.  That compels us to legislate to critically evaluate operations on the unborn.  Provisions are lacking and should be amended post-haste.  I take this position on humanitarian and ethical grounds, backed up by scientific evidence.  This Bill offers genuine compassion.  I appeal to all my parliamentary colleagues to join me by voting for this Bill and ensuring that it reaches Committee Stage.  Hopefully it will progress beyond that to become law, a Private Member's Bill from the Rural Independent Group entitled an Act to provide for pain relief for the foetus in certain cases of termination of pregnancy; and to provide for related matters.<\/p>  <p>  I hoped that the Minister would not table an amendment to this.  By tabling the amendment, he is putting his fellow Deputies and party members under the whip.  I want an open, transparent vote on this.  I would like the Minister to remove his amendment and to allow everyone in this House the right to vote on the Rural Independent Group's Bill.  I ask the Minister to do that and to let every Deputy in this House have an open vote, without producing the whip.  I ask the Minister to do that on humanitarian grounds.  Let everyone in this House have a voice of their own without the whip.  I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment.  Let the Rural Independent Group's Bill go and let everyone in this House answer the people of Ireland truthfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500011#J00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1639564320,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I am glad to be a co-sponsor of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021.  I was never more devastated or disappointed than when I stood up, on behalf of our group, to table a motion here years ago seeking pain relief when we had failed in our efforts to protect the unborn child, as a last desperate attempt to ensure that they would not feel pain, and a vote was called.  We subsequently lost that vote.  I thought it was devastating, cold, hard and cruel beyond belief.  We live in a society where animals are protected from pain.  It is a requirement to administer pain relief to animals and make sure that they are not subjected to cruelty.  We have many veterinarians in the countryside, in the parish that I am from, including great people such as Mike O'Sullivan, Brendan Teahan and Leslie Dignam.  They are good vets who go around to take care of animals.  We now have a situation where we are being denied the right to take care of little unborn babies to protect them from feeling pain.<\/p>  <p>  I find it impossible to believe that the Government is not willing to accept this.  It wants to deny that an unborn child is a person.  I have always said in this D&aacute;il, and it hurts many people when I say it, that from the moment of conception until the moment of death, a person is a human being.  They are the future doctors, politicians and teachers.<\/p> <p>They are the people who we want to nourish and who we want to help come into the world to live their lives and to be given the same opportunity as everyone one of us.  I believe that in my heart and soul.  If I was offered the size of this room in &euro;100 notes, I would burn it to protect one unborn child because I believe in letting these young people come into the world and be given the same right as myself, the Minister or anyone else was.<\/p> <p> A vote took place in this country.  A decision was taken.  We live in a democracy.  We were entitled to our opinion at the time.  Other people won the vote on that.  We are not standing up here today looking to rewrite history or to rewrite that vote because we cannot do that.  What we are trying to do is to help a small vulnerable person from feeling pain, and it is a person.  It is a human being.  That unborn child is a person.  They are being denied the right to be born into the world but they are also being denied the right not to have to feel pain.<\/p> <p> There are Members who will come in here tonight and be under the whip and vote in accordance with their parties, not with their conscience.  I ask the Minister to be a man about this and to go back to the Government and say, \"Right, let everybody come in here tonight and vote with a thing called their conscience.\"  God gave us a conscience, but, of course, many Members in this Chamber do not believe in God either.  As much dislike as they might have for many things, they dislike God.  They hate him being referenced.  They hate us being humble about it, blessing ourselves and having our manners about religion.  People hate that.  There are people who actually hate it.  I do not mind talking about God.  I do not mind saying that I think it is right that people should be able to come in here tonight and vote with their conscience, and vote for what they believe is right and what they believe is wrong.<\/p> <p> How could any human being look me straight in the eye and say with any conviction and with any honesty in his heart and soul that it is wrong to want to stop a little person of feeling pain?  Every one of us will have to die and how a person could face God after denying a person the right to pain relief is hard to understand.  If I was under any one of their whips tonight, I would crack the whip back at them and I would vote with my conscience.<\/p> <p> I plead with the many fine respectable Members who are in this House today - to hell with Fianna F&aacute;il, to hell with Fine Gael, to hell with Sinn F&eacute;in, to hell with Labour and to hell with all of their whips - to come in here tonight and vote for what they believe to be right or what they believe to be wrong.  On my knees, I would plead with them to come in and vote for the little person, the person who does not have a voice, the unborn little child, the man or woman of tomorrow who will not see tomorrow because he or she has been denied that right.  At least, give them the right not to feel pain and hurt and the horribleness that an abortion actually is, and to anybody who would like to forget about it, an abortion is a horrible thing.  The Government should offer more support to people who have crisis pregnancies and try to help them, but, for God's sake, should not deny us the right of our motion, which is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500011#J00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639564920,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I thank the proposers of the Bill for bringing it forward in the first instance and giving us an opportunity to have this debate on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The language we use and the tone we strike as legislators is important.  It matters to women going through a crisis pregnancy, it matters to those families who have received a diagnosis of a fatal abnormality and it matters to those who have had to make that difficult decision to seek a termination in the past.  It also matters to all the healthcare professionals who are providing a necessary and professional service to women right across the State, unfortunately, not across the island.<\/p>  <p>  When dealing with this issue as legislators, we must be conscious of the mandate given to us by the Irish people directly through the referendum.  It was the Irish people who demanded that we in this House legislate to bring forward safe and accessible abortion services, and that is exactly what we did.  A long, and at times fraught, process was put in place that ultimately gave rise to the referendum and subsequently the legislation which, for the first time, put these services in place for Irish women.<\/p>  <p>  As part of that process, the amendment that comes before us as a Bill was thoroughly debated and discussed.  To be fair to the proposers of the Bill, nobody here would disagree with its core sentiment.  Of course, we support the administration of pain relief.  Who would not?  Of course, we support medical professionals carrying out these procedures preventing avoidable pain where it is deemed necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I suspect the only difference we have on this matter is that which was articulated before when this issue was last debated and voted on.  It is my firm belief that clinical decisions such as this should be taken by clinicians and not by politicians.  I trust our doctors and our nurses.  I trust our great healthcare professionals to do their jobs without interference from me or from any other unqualified person.  I believe that the appropriate place for determining such practice are the clinical guidelines for termination of pregnancy, rather than in primary legislation such as this, and that is a matter for the doctors to decide.<\/p>  <p>  It is our responsibility as legislators to ensure that there are robust legislative frameworks to support the policy decisions of the Oireachtas and the people.  When it comes to medicine, it is the responsibility of the medical regulatory institutions &ndash; in this case, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland &ndash; to set out clinical guidelines within that legislative framework to regulate and make operational, in medical terms, that policy.<\/p>  <p>  In this State, we have an independent medical profession that is free to pursue and implement clinical guidelines, subject to the legislative frameworks and policies set by the democratic institutions, on the basis of the latest medical-scientific research, with ethical practice regulated by the Medical Council.  That key principle must underpin the delivery of modern, compassionate healthcare that puts the patient, in this case, the woman, first.<\/p>  <p>  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, supports modern, compassionate healthcare.  We must be careful not to cross the line between legislation and clinical guidelines and it is my fear that this legislation does that.  We should not infringe on the independence that is so essential to the delivery of modern healthcare.  This is an important principle that must underpin access to any healthcare &ndash; that we trust doctors to deliver the service in an ethical and safe way.  If they do not, there are mechanisms for recourse via the professional and regulatory institutions, such as the Medical Council.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing prohibiting the administration of pain relief, where deemed necessary by a clinician, in the existing legislation.  If there are difficulties in providing such pain relief where a clinician deems it necessary, then that is something which the health service must rectify.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, the fundamental point here is that we must trust our doctors.  We must acknowledge that this is a decision for the medical professional who is carrying out the procedure.  It is not appropriate, in my view, to mandate compulsory treatments, care pathways or patient treatment plans in legislation.  That would not work in any other sphere of healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing preventing the medical profession from coming to a view and setting requirements in guidelines that they continue to review and reformulate in accordance with a medical scientific approach.  That is the approach we support for delivering any necessary pain relief because the appropriate place for regulating such practices are the clinical guidelines for termination of pregnancy, not legislation.  On that basis, I will support the Government amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to set out Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s all-island position on abortion services.  Sometimes misleading and inaccurate statements have been made in this House and by Members of this House in the media to distract from Government failures to fully commission services across the State.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to delivering the same services, North and South.  We want to see the alignment and delivery of abortion services across the island, and the services available in this State implemented in the North.<\/p> <p>We want to deliver modern, compassionate healthcare North, South, east and west.  We want to deliver a system that removes the need of any pregnant person to travel to England or elsewhere for an abortion they need.  We want to keep the operation of these services under review to ensure they are compassionate, appropriate, patient-centric, and informed by the best available medical advice.<\/p> <p> In the Executive and the Assembly, our Ministers and MLAs will continue to push for the immediate commissioning of abortion services in the North and the alignment of services with this State.  It is now more than a year since the law changed to legalise abortion in the North.  It is totally unacceptable that the commissioning of services continues to be blocked by the DUP and UUP.  Our amendments to deliver these services have been rejected time and again by the DUP and the UUP.  All of us in this House have a responsibility to recognise the blocks that have been put in the way of people in the North seeking access to abortion services.  We will table a motion in the Assembly in the new year to push back against this obstructionism.  I hope that political leaders in this State, from all parties, will add their voices to this call and help to deliver these services for people across our island.<\/p> <p> It is very important that the Assembly in the North does exactly what it should do.  We have to take our responsibilities in this House very seriously.  We supported the legislation that enabled the services to be put in place in the South.  Ministers in the North from the DUP and the UUP are blocking any attempts by Sinn F&eacute;in and others to get this through the Executive.  We need to ensure by any means possible that no matter what part of the island they live on, women have access to exactly the same level of abortion services.  Sadly, that is not the case.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will come at this again with vigour and energy in the new year as best we can.<\/p> <p> I also raise the matter of the review of the provision of abortion services in this State.  The review process itself is central to the amendment the Minister tabled.  We had a very lengthy discussion at the Joint Committee on Health a number of weeks ago and since then we have had a chance to review the terms of reference for the review process.  The appointment of an independent chair needs to happen as soon as possible.  The Minister has given a commitment to expedite that and has gone through a procurement process.  We all hope that will happen very quickly.  I reiterate my view that the chair should have been in place at the start of the process and should have had a role in overseeing the outreach and public consultation process.  The quicker we get the independent chair in place, the better for everybody.<\/p> <p> We need to get this review fully under way.  The Government must ensure the widest possible stakeholder engagement with those who accessed or sought to access the services, those who have provided the services and those who felt unable to provide them, as well as the views of organisations helping people who need these services.  We need to hear from women who were able to avail of the services but we also need to hear from women who were unable to do so, for whatever reason.  Wherever that takes us, so be it.  We have to hear the experiences of everybody.<\/p> <p> The Minister has clearly said that the review will not start from the point of view of policy but that of the operation of the Act.  Those are the terms of reference for the review.  There is going to be a very obvious crossover in some of that, as he has acknowledged, and it may be the case that the review process will then make recommendations that are policy-based.  We will have to wait and see what comes from that.  The review must include the needs of any hospitals that have been unable to fully commission services.  It must be explicit in the reasons any public healthcare facility that could provide the services is not doing so.  We had a discussion on this issue at the committee.  Many maternity hospitals are not providing a service.  There may be a reason for that in some instances because of the scale of the hospital, as it might be a level 2 or level 3 hospital, but we need to understand why that is the case.  We need to get to a point where these services are available in every maternity hospital.  There are also issues in some rural areas with access to GPs providing the appropriate service.  All of that will be critical to the review process.<\/p> <p> While the purpose of the review as set out in the legislation is to examine the operation of the Act, that does not constrain it from accepting evidence on, and including an analysis of, the impact of different aspects of the legislation on access to services and whether women feel the services are compassionate.  It is important that the review does not narrowly focus on the operation of the Act, as prescribed in the legislation.  We have to be as open, transparent and generous as we can in this review process to capture all the experiences and make sure none of them are limited or prevented from making their way into the final conclusions of the process.  That would be problematic and would undermine its integrity.  The review may be limited in what it can recommend but it is a unique opportunity to gain insight into the real experiences of patients accessing these services and clinicians delivering these services, or not delivering them, as the case may be.  It can, and should, provide an evidence base for us, as legislators and policymakers, to review the impact of the previously decided policies.  We must ensure that decisions made previously have delivered a fair and fit-for-purpose system.  This review cannot be blinkered and its output, at least in the collection of testimony and evidence on experience, must be examined in its totality.  That means all experiences.<\/p> <p> Only half of the maternity units in the State deliver abortion services, meaning half of maternity units are falling short on their obligations and are not providing a service.  This is exacerbating the serious geographical discrepancies in access to a GP who will provide services.  The Minister has acknowledged those geographical discrepancies.  We do not need to wait for the review to paint a picture or signpost the way forward.  Where we know there are gaps under the existing legislation and the operation of the Act, we can already move if necessary.  We can support those maternity hospitals and make sure we have sufficient capacity in primary care across all areas so women are not travelling 70 miles or more to get to a GP, as we know is happening in some cases.  They have to ring multiple GPs, in some cases seven or eight, until they can find one who will provide them with the service and access to information.  That is problematic.<\/p> <p> This is a matter of trusting doctors as those best placed to advise and support those seeking to access services.  It is about recognising that they are best placed to determine the clinical needs and treatments required.  It is about recognising that abortion services must be fit for purpose and implemented fully right across this island.  It is about supporting women and pregnant people and addressing their medical needs.  I do not believe a single Member is against compassionate services that administer any necessary pain relief.  Everybody in the House would want that to be in place but the point is that it is in place already.  Doctors and clinicians can provide that pain relief if and when it is deemed necessary.  The place for determining that is in the clinical guidelines and not in primary legislation.  For all those reasons, I will support the Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500012#K00200","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639565520,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I am glad to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party and to set out why we cannot support this Bill.  We will support the Government amendment.  There is no care or compassion for women's health conveyed throughout the Bill, nor would it do anything to enhance or improve the health of women or our access to reproductive healthcare.  As previous speakers have said, language matters in this debate.  It is very important that we all speak on issues relating to women's reproductive health, abortion and crisis pregnancies with compassion, empathy and understanding for the many women in this country who face the awful prospect of a crisis pregnancy and who are faced with considerations and choices to make.  We have to be conscious that for far too long in our very recent history, the language of foetal rights and that of the life of the unborn was used to devalue the lives and the health of pregnant women.<\/p> <p>It was used in such a way as we saw in 1983 with the eighth amendment to the Constitution and the consequent litigation on that.  We saw terrible consequences for the health and lives of pregnant women.<\/p> <p> Until the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018, our fundamental law and Constitution placed undue priority upon the protection of foetal life, placing the right to life of the pregnant woman and the foetus in direct conflict with the appalling consequences that are well known and have been well documented.  We might recall the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 and the dreadful case of PP in 2014 in which a pregnant woman was kept alive on life support against her family&rsquo;s wishes and against the clinical judgment of her medical team because of the eighth amendment.  We might recall the women who took their cases to the European Court of Human Rights, known as A, B and C, and the women like Amanda Mellet and Siobh&aacute;n Whelan who took their cases before the United Nations.  We might also remember the many more women, whose stories are untold but all of whom suffered under the eighth amendment and the approximately 160,000 women who were forced to travel abroad, often in dire circumstances, to access terminations of pregnancy, in many cases placing their health at risk.<\/p> <p> It was the recognition of that reality and of the real consequence of the eighth amendment, including that undue priority that was placed on foetal life that caused the Irish people to vote by a 66.4% majority in 2018 to delete the text that equated the right to life of the foetus with that of the pregnant woman from the Constitution.  We should not forget that the referendum followed extensive debate on measures such as those proposed in this Private Members&rsquo; Bill, as well as extensive consultation through the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly process and the Oireachtas committee process.  We might recall that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution recommended repeal for three key reasons.  It did so because of the impact the amendment had on the provision of services for pregnant women; the continuing and ongoing breach of Ireland&rsquo;s international human rights obligations; and the practical reality of thousands of women being forced to travel every year or to import the abortion pill.<\/p> <p> It was those considerations and the compassion and empathy for women in crisis pregnancy that brought about the holding of the referendum in 2018 and that remarkable result in repealing it by such a strong and clear majority.  That majority voted in clear knowledge that the legislation which had previously been published would provide for legal abortion in Ireland consequently.  This was progress and a huge step forward for the rights of women and girls.  None of us in this House really wants to go back to those days pre-2018 when those of us who had daughters &ndash; and I have two &ndash; would face the prospect of those girls growing up under the chill of the eighth amendment, as so many of us did.  I speak as somebody who was taken to court 32 years ago and threatened with prison for giving information to women in crisis pregnancy in my role as president of the Trinity College Students' Union.  I will never forget the calls we got in the students union every day and every week in those dark years of 1989 and 1990 from women and girls in crisis pregnancy who were desperate to get the phone number of a clinic in England because they felt they had no choice but to terminate their pregnancies and we failed them in this State for far too long, for the 35 years the eighth amendment was in place.  Let us not go back to those dark days.  I am proud of the role the Labour Party played during those years; of the role my party played in the repeal campaign; and of my party as a pro-choice party.  The activists of Labour Women and of the party were at the forefront of the repeal campaign.<\/p> <p> We are supporting the Government amendment and we want to work constructively with the Minister and the Government on the statutory review process that we are glad to see under way.  We have been critical of the apparent narrowness of the terms of reference and I note the concerns expressed today by the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland on the terms of reference.  We want to ensure that reforms will be introduced on foot of the experiential survey the Minister is conducting and I am glad to hear that Dr. Catherine Conlon of Trinity College Dublin will be leading the study into women&rsquo;s experiences.  They must be at the heart of the review.  I am also glad that we will see the experiences of service providers and of the operation of the Act in the survey.<\/p> <p> It is also important that we look at policy recommendations and changes to enhance and strengthen women&rsquo;s rights of access.  In particular we want to see the lifting of the three-day waiting period, which does not have any medical basis and again the National Women&rsquo;s&rsquo; Council of Ireland has made that point today.  We want to see the introduction of safe access zones law to protect from intimidation women who seek to access terminations.  Again today I see Together for Safety noting that there are still ongoing intimidatory protests around our maternity hospitals.  We are concerned that there are women in this country who, because of geographic differences in services cannot access terminations of pregnancies here and who have to travel still.  We know that 375 women had to travel to England in 2020, compounding the crisis of the pregnancies they faced in many cases.  We want to make sure we can deliver the reproductive health services we so clearly need to women in this country.  For far too long those services were denied to us under that chill of the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p> Let us not take so long about the review this time either.  Let us not take as long as it took us to repeal the eighth amendment.  If I had known as a 21-year old activist that it would take over three decades to repeal the eighth amendment and to deliver healthcare to women in this country I do not know what I would have done.  It was such a relief to so many of us of my generation to see the eighth amendment finally repealed in 2018.  We do not want to go back.  We want to ensure we move forward, build on the services that are available and build on the legislative provisions clearly set out in the 2018 Act.  We want to ensure our clinical guidelines deliver doctors and medical professionals the guidance they need to ensure the Act is implemented with compassion, empathy and care for women who are pregnant, who are facing crisis pregnancy and who require terminations of pregnancy.  That is the clear pathway forward that my party wants to see and I believe the clear majority of people in Ireland want to see that, as represented by that tremendous vote in 2018.  Let us not go back and let us ensure that none of our daughters or granddaughters has to live under the chill of the eighth amendment or endure the sort of terrible consequences that so many women endured in this country for far too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500013#L00200","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639566120,"counter":53,"content":"<p>This Bill is deeply troubling and morally wrong.  It is an attempt to undermine the will of the Irish people.  It is trying to legislate on medical best practice.  This is not only inappropriate, but also incredibly disrespectful to women and doctors.  Ultimately, it is a move to control women&rsquo;s bodies.  We are not going to return to those days.  The eighth amendment and all it represented was decisively dismissed by the Irish people.  The only question for this House now is how we can ensure best medical and caring practice for women and families.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is cloaked in language of compassion when in reality it is trying to drag us backwards and to have the debate all over again.  All we can say to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The people of Ireland, especially the women who have had to endure patriarchal control for generations, will not put up with it.  The days of middle-aged men trying to control the bodies of young women are over.  We have won our bodily autonomy and we are not giving it up.  This Bill is straight from the playbook of anti-choice Americans.  It is a commonly used barrier on behalf of those who believe in forced pregnancies.  It makes it more difficult for women in traumatic situations to access healthcare.  I would have hoped that no one would think of putting forward such a Bill, especially given how clearly the Irish people spoke on this issue.  The majority of people voted for free, safe and legal abortion.  In my constituency almost 65% of people voted in its favour.  I trust women, families, doctors and nurses.<\/p>  <p>  It is highly inappropriate for legislators to intervene in medical practices.  Despite our under-funded health service, we have some of the most dedicated and caring medical staff in the world and this Bill is acutely insulting to the care they provide every day.  Patients and healthcare professionals should have the freedom to make decisions based on medical science and the best interests of the patients themselves, nothing else.  Legislation on particular medical procedures is not just highly inappropriate but it serves to confuse and restrict options available to women and families, often in the most tragic circumstances.  Abortions are healthcare and girls and women are entitled to reproductive health.  The Irish people have guaranteed those rights.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is part of a larger anti-choice strategy to treat abortion care as exceptional.  Where are the laws on anaesthetics for orthopaedic surgery, or the Bills regulating colorectal procedures or prostate cancer care?  They are not up for debate in this House because we trust medical professionals.  It appears that the Rural Independent Group believes that healthcare for girls and women needs legislation.  This Bill is especially callous and upsetting for women and families who have experienced terminations after 20 weeks.  The fact that we are standing here debating this and the inevitable coverage it will receive will no doubt be very distressing to them, and my heart goes out to every individual and family affected.  Cases of foetal anomaly are rare, sensitive, clinically complex and altogether heartbreaking.<\/p>  <p>It is astonishingly disrespectful to try to sensationalise later abortions.  They are the most difficult and emotional decisions a woman or family will ever have to make.<br\/><br\/>The exceptionally courageous individuals and couples involved in terminations for medical reasons were forced to share their personal stories of pain and sorrow during the referendum.  Anyone who is willing to listen will know the hurt and agony they endured in situations with no good options.  Their choice for termination is always based on love.  They are motivated to end or prevent suffering.  To suggest these people and their medical professionals need a law to consider foetal pain is particularly cruel.  We should be discussing the support we can put in place for these women and their families.  Many, mainly those who need terminations for medical reasons, still have to travel abroad to get care that should be available at home.<br\/><br\/>I will clarify the reality that has been greatly distorted by earlier contributions.  Foetal anomaly terminations are carried out in line with best medical practice as part of a larger care plan in ways that are humane and minimise distress.  Healthcare practitioners are highly trained and obviously already follow the highest ethical duties of care.  These complicated and sensitive cases have to be guided by medical science and ethics, not dictated by anti-choice Deputies or external groups.  This Bill is unnecessary, inappropriate and hurtful.  Instead, we should be discussing the ways we can ensure compassionate abortion care.  Our legislation still falls very far short of international human rights law and medical standards.<br\/><br\/>Before I move on to the review, which is what we should all be talking about and how we can better the legislation, I wish to refer to Deputy Cullinane's comment and Sinn F&eacute;in being determined to ensure women in Northern Ireland can access abortion case, we would all like to believe that.  Perhaps the Deputy can explain why Sinn F&eacute;in keeps abstaining when it comes to Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, Bills in the North that seek to limit that.<br\/><br\/>Regrettably, it seems the Minister for Health has chosen to review the operation of the current law rather than the legislation itself.  The experiences of women over the past three years cannot be disregarded by the State.  The glaring issues, which were identified early on, remain and will remain for years if the Minister remains committed to the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I think we all hope that will not happen.<br\/><br\/>We must ask the following.  Have the Government parties learned nothing from the referendum?  Do they still think of this as a subject to be avoided rather than accept the people are clearly in favour of safe and supportive abortion care?  The current law does not represent this.  It is a shame the Government has not yet been clear on whether it will provide the necessary review.<br\/><br\/>As I have mentioned, people in the most heartbreaking situations are still forced to travel due to the restrictions under the current law.  These restrictions have no basis in medical science.  Instead of women, their partners and doctors making decisions based on best practice and compassion, they must get legal advice.  This needs to stop.  This was a key issue for many voters in the referendum.  Never again should a family enduring a traumatic situation be forced onto a plane or a boat.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, the mandatory three-day waiting period, which is not evidence-based, has a negative impact on those seeking abortion care, especially in rural areas where access to transport and providers is limited.  This delay is medically unnecessary and only serves as an additional barrier.  It must be removed.<br\/><br\/>Abortions need to be decriminalised.  This is another oppressive tool that creates uncertainty, forcing medical practitioners to make legal rather than medical decisions.<br\/><br\/>Ireland still does not provide proper maternity and pregnancy care.  Earlier routine prenatal screening and perinatal genetic services are still not available.  Maternity units are understaffed.<br\/><br\/>The current law is restrictive and harmful.  It puts in place arbitrary barriers, creates uncertainty for medical professionals, and forces women and couples to continue to travel for terminations.  It is within the Government's power to change all of this and it must act.  The Bill before us needs to be voted down today.  I welcome the Government's position to help achieve that, but I will still push for the real review we so desperately need.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is upsetting for the women and families who have had later abortions.  It is also insulting to our healthcare practictioners.  Anybody who canvassed during the referendum will remember that when they knocked on doors and talked to people, many of them were voting yes for the people who needed to travel for terminations for medical reasons, and they are still forced to do that.<br\/><br\/>This Bill represents sensationalism that has no place in any humane system concerned with best medical practice.  It definitely has no place in a republic that voted overwhelmingly for free, safe and legal abortion care.  The days of this House controlling the bodies of women and girls has passed whether the sponsors of the Bill realise it or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500014#M00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639566720,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Barry.<\/p><p>I understand what Deputy Cairns meant when she said she had hoped this Bill would not be before the House and that it is not something we wish to face.  Given I am a good bit older than her and been through a life of political activism, all I can say is get used to it.  Every time you make one step forward, they will try to grab two steps backwards.<\/p><p>This is not the first time I have seen women's gains in this country being chipped away at and an attempt made to erode them.  I have seen the same happen with workers' rights, water charges and very many campaigns we have fought on behalf of communities, the oppressed and, in particular, on behalf of women, because we have a horrible legacy in this country of the oppression of women.<\/p><p>This Bill smacks of an attempt to roll back on the gains of the repeal the eighth movement.  People should not forget how earth-shattering that movement and outcome were.  It was absolutely groundbreaking stuff in terms of the history of this country and the shape of the future.  How it happened was through people power and, in particular, through the massive determination of young women throughout the country to see their rights attained and not to have to live in the dark atmosphere in which their mothers, sisters and all the rest had to live and grow up in, be sexually active in, and be potential mothers in or not at all.  That is why I think what is happening here today is straight out of the playbook of American fundamentalism.<\/p><p>One of the most honest speakers here today has been Deputy Danny Healy-Rae because he mentioned the heartbeat several times.  It is interesting that, not that long ago, a piece of legislation was brought in in Texas, known as the heartbeat legislation, that basically bans abortion once a heartbeat can be detected in a foetus at six weeks.  Most of us would not know we were pregnant at six weeks.  They have been chipping away at this for decades since the Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade  judgment, and the Texas legislation makes it possible for any citizen to sue another citizen for helping a woman procure an abortion.  That is dark ages stuff, and this in a country where abortion was once upon a time available and part of the health service.  Chipping away at women's rights is something we can expect over the next period.<\/p><p>Last night I read back on the transcript from the debate in the House when the group of Deputies who have put forward this Bill also supported an amendment when we tried to frame the regulations around the termination of pregnancy.  It is carbon copy stuff; there is nothing any different.<\/p><p>I, for one, am not surprised this Bill is before the House.  I will expect it or something similar to come before the House again whenever time allows because what it is trying to do is to row back on the rights women have won and were long fought for, as has been said by other Deputies, by spreading misinformation, doubt and hoping to create hoops, loops and jumps women will have to go through before they can access abortion.  They cannot ban it outright or object to it outright but they will try to chip away at it.  The kind of Ireland that would bring us back to is the kind of Ireland that saw mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries, symphysiotomy and women being absolutely ignored in terms of their medical needs.<\/p><p>We, as Deputies, are not in a position to pass laws that say whether medical procedures require anaesthesia.  Abortion care should be a normal part of medicine in this country and treated in the same way as other procedures, so that when doctors need to administer them, they should be able to administer them.<\/p> <p>It is precisely that type of right-wing, religiously motivated political interference we have all become familiar with through the A case, the B case, the C case, the X case and the Y case.  We have known the sort of pitiless regime that was imposed on women in the past.<\/p> <p> I welcome the defeat of the DUP Bill in Stormont last night.  I welcome the fact Sinn F&eacute;in changed its position and voted against that Bill.  It must be said that was a result of the pressure of people power and the activism of young women across Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> I want to make a very clear point about why we take up these moral attitudes about pregnancy, reproduction and women.  It is shameful these attitudes are taken in a country where 2,500 children will sleep in homeless accommodation tonight and more than 2,000 children are in direct provision.  We know for sure that affects their ability to live a happy life.  Growing up in those circumstances affects their mental health.  These are children who have been born.  They are walking, thinking, breathing and living.  I wish I could hear the Deputies who have brought forward this Bill kick up the same amount of fuss as regularly about children who have been born as they do, both inside and outside this House, about those who have not yet been born.  The choice of the woman is involved and that is always totally ignored.<\/p> <p> We can expect more of this.  There are protests outside abortion clinics and GP centres where abortions are being delivered.  That is a fundamentalist view.  We need to look forward to the review of the termination of pregnancy regulations, to ensure the three-day barrier is removed and we put an end to only 10% of GPs providing services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500015#N00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639567320,"counter":57,"content":"<p>What is Fianna F&aacute;il playing at?

The Deputies want to roll back the gains made by women in 2018 when the country voted to repeal the eighth amendment.

I will, therefore, appeal to all Deputies, including those who support legal abortion, to join in voting for this Bill, which merely shows a measure of compassion for unborn children at a relatively disadvantaged stage in their prenatal development.  I can see no legitimate ground for objecting to it.  In fact, some will say the Bill does not go far enough.  It only requires pain relief where, first, there are reasonable grounds for believing the pregnancy concerned may have reached or exceeded 20 weeks or, second, it is likely that pain could be caused to the foetus arising from termination of pregnancy.  I wholeheartedly support this Bill because I recognise it seeks to achieve what seems achievable in the House on the issue of pain relief.  Most of all, I support it because it is a positive and unimaginably important step for every unborn child who needs the protection of its providers.<\/p>  <p>  Most of us will know the joy of seeing ultrasound pictures of a son, a daughter, a grandson or a granddaughter of 20 weeks or younger.  Just as we cannot deny the humanity of that child, visible before our very eyes, equally we cannot deny how visible and clear is the humanity of another child when seen at the same stage.  A 2016 review of the evidence concludes that from the 15th week of gestation onward, the foetus is extremely sensitive to pain stimuli and this fact should be taken into account when performing invasive medical procedures on the foetus.<\/p>  <p>  In answering a parliamentary question I asked in October, the HSE confirmed that dilation and evacuation abortions are happening in Ireland.  The gruesome details of those horrific procedures are too graphic to describe during this debate.  The use of such procedures only further underlines the urgent need for pain relief.<\/p>  <p>  Some in this House will say this matter should be left to the doctor to decide.  They will see the flaws in this view if they consider it.  If a doctor were about to perform a procedure intended to take such a Deputy's life without his or her consent, would he or she think the same doctor is well placed to decide whether to give pain relief?  Does the Animal Health and Welfare Act leave it to veterinarians to decide whether to give pain relief to animals?  It does not.  The law does not stop at the hospital door.  Doctors are subject to legal duties and prohibitions of many kinds.  The past three years of complete failure to ensure pain relief to unborn children have shown that this cannot be left to the medical profession and must be addressed through statute.

I continue to support its humanitarian measures completely and I encourage my colleagues to allow this Bill to progress to Committee Stage.  The Bill will place an obligation to give pain relief to unborn babies before late-term abortions.  Scientific evidence now suggests unborn babies can feel pain before 20 weeks' gestation.  This was pointed to in a recent article published in the peer-reviewed <i>Journal of Medical Ethics<\/i>in 2020.  By providing pain relief to unborn babies, we are simply doing the decent thing in light of the growing medical evidence.<\/p><p>It is worth repeating the point that late-term abortions are happening in Ireland.  Under the 2018 abortion legislation, three separate sections allow for the provision of late-term abortions under broad and vague terms.  In these circumstances, unborn babies are extremely likely to feel pain.  The proposals contained within this foetal pain relief Bill would ensure these babies did not have to suffer pain as their lives were being ended.<\/p><p>It is important to note the proposals contained within this Bill are specific and not linked to other aspects of the abortion debate.  Providing unborn humans with pain relief is a measure based upon fundamental principles of human rights and ethics.  I would appeal to Deputies to approach this Bill on its particulars and judge it on its merits.<\/p><p>The most recent guidelines from January 2020 set out by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Ireland make no reference to the provision of pain relief medication for babies in late-term abortions.  By contrast, extensive protections exist in Irish law for animals to ensure they do not suffer unnecessary pain.  If basic animal welfare is considered necessary and good, why is the same principle not applied to humans?  This is a legitimate question which should be addressed without any side-stepping of the issue.<\/p><p>A similar amendment to the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill was tabled in 2018 but was rejected, unfortunately, before the new abortion law came into force.  I hope the passage of time and the presence of new evidence which has since come to light will impact on Deputies and encourage them to consider this Bill today with a fresh perspective.  It is extremely unfortunate that pain relief was not included within the abortion legislation from the outset.  That would have avoided the issue surfacing again now.  The best time to rectify this issue is now rather than later.<\/p><p>Providing pain relief medication for unborn babies undergoing surgical procedures for spina bifida and similar ailments is widespread general practice.  However, during abortions, the same measures are not applied.  This is an unfair inconsistency that is not based on any ethical or scientific consideration but is based simply on whether a baby is wanted or unwanted.  Irrespective of a person's views on abortion, this inconsistency should be addressed and a provision set in place to ensure unborn babies are spared the pain inflicted upon them in an abortion.<\/p><p>Although this Bill concerns abortion, it does nothing to impact on the operation of abortion in this country.<\/p> <p>It simply addresses an easy fix to a problem.  The problem is increasingly being considered internationally in countries such as France, where 97% of late-term abortions are provided with pain relief medication as humane measures.  This can be done in Ireland as has been done abroad.  In context, the current three-year review of the abortion legislation is important.  The issues raised within the Bill should be taken seriously by the Minister for Health.  We need this issue to be taken seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500016#O00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639567920,"counter":61,"content":"<p>In the first two years of abortion in Ireland, 13,243 babies had their lives ended by the State abortion services.

I understand that, for many, dedicating so much unnecessary time constantly rediscussing this topic can be incredibly triggering.  In reality, that is what this discussion and this Bill are: completely and wholly unnecessary.  The best argument for this comes from Deputy Nolan herself.  When introducing this Bill, she stated that doctors administer pain relief as a matter of course.  She knows well, as does the whole Rural Independent Group, that doctors will administer pain relief when required.  They do not need to be legally obliged to do so.  Any suggestion this is not the case is completely disingenuous and Deputy Nolan herself has confirmed this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  Most instances of late-term abortions occur due to high-risk or emergency situations, so this Bill is attempting to address an issue that does not even exist.  It is a made-up issue and a made-up Bill with the sole purpose to mislead the public.  Let us call this what it is.  This is nothing but an attempt to rally anger and cause outrage.  I am not naive enough to think that the Rural Independent Group does know what it is doing by introducing this Bill.  This Bill has nothing to do with good medical practice.  This is a blatant attempt to create confusion and upset and nothing more.  I emphasise that technically this Bill does nothing.  The sole aim of the Bill is to confuse and to divide the public.  It is malicious, disingenuous and a massive waste of time, to be frank.<\/p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group is against all abortion at any stage or by any means, and while that is fair enough, I refuse to indulge in this hidden agenda to obsess over what women do with their bodies, dressed up as a Bill.  Some 66.4% of this country&rsquo;s electorate voted to repeal the eighth amendment in 2018, yet this group is still forcing conversations about abortion care.  It is clear what our citizens want, and we would do well to respect this vote rather than trying to undermine it at every given opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of participating in this time-wasting exercise, I would instead like to use my time to address the important issue of the repeal review.  When abortion legislation was passed three years ago, we were told that issues with this legislation would be addressed in the repeal review.  Yet now the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has stated the review would look at its operation but is not intended to examine policy on terminations.  This review is important and we must use it as an opportunity to address problems with this legislation.  It needs to be a wide-ranging review that is not just limited to the procedure itself.  It should address with the current system and ensure people do not have to travel to get their rights.<\/p>  <p>  The Abortion Rights Campaign has stated that participants found the mandatory three-day waiting period demeaning and induced undue stress and anxiety.  The three-day waiting period must be removed.  It places extra barriers in the way of women, and the delay is medically unnecessary.  I also call for the review to ensure free, universal abortion care for everyone in Ireland, including those without a PPS number and those in Northern Ireland.  I commend the MLAs in the North who rejected the DUP Bill to stop terminations for non-fatal disabilities yesterday.  Such a Bill would have been a massive step backwards for this island.

I would like some clarity on this.  Will the terms of reference allow it?  Will it be part of the review?  That is an important question.  The Minister determines the terms of reference, so he has the answer.  We need a policy response on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  To be honest, I was not even aware of this issue until a few months ago.  In my ignorance I assumed a foetus, an unborn child, would automatically be provided with some form of pain relief, analgesia or anaesthetic before an abortion procedure.  It never occurred to me this might not be the case.  I have spoken to many others and they have the same opinion as me.  I am not sure what is going on here and I will come back to that issue in a moment.  In some ways I wonder what I am doing making a request in the D&aacute;il for a foetus about to be aborted to be treated humanely.  I know the vast the majority of healthcare workers are decent, humane people who dedicate their entire lives to saving lives and to ensuring quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  I thought maybe it is not the role of politicians to draft primary legislation on this and that maybe we should leave this to our healthcare professionals.  However, I was wrong because I looked at the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which obliges vets to administer pain relief during any procedure carried out on animals where they are likely to feel pain.  Some colleagues say guidelines are sufficient, but is this in any guidelines?  Is this a choice for healthcare professionals?  I very much want to hear some clarity on this situation.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard other colleagues speak about what this Bill does not do.  They are right.  Like any amendments to legislation, it deals with a specific issue only and that does not negate its value.  The abortion debate is over.  The people decided.  Our role is to ensure the legislation in place works for all concerned.  That is why we are having a review, and the issue of foetal pain during termination needs to be part of that.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard comments from colleagues that this Bill is proposed by anti-choice public representatives, by right-wing Deputies.  That is divisive language.  We have managed to negotiate a way forward in Ireland because many people - not all but many - were careful with their language on both sides.  Many people looked at the complete picture and not just the bits and pieces they supported.  That is why I believe all of these issues, such as access to services for women, compassion and care for women and for the foetus to be aborted, is all part of the picture.  We do not need to revert to the debates of the past.  We heard some of them here this morning.  We need to move forward in the most humane way possible.  As legislators, we need to look at all aspects and not leave out any aspect.<\/p> <p>It is widely accepted that unborn babies over 20 weeks, and very possibly younger, can experience pain.  Even if that is just a possibility and if it is only one in 100 cases, we cannot ignore that.  In my opinion nobody loses if we require the administration of pain relief to a foetus before and during abortion.  Nobody loses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500017#P00500","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639568520,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank the Members of the D&aacute;il who contributed to the debate on this Private Members' Bill.  The Minister and I recognise there are deeply held views on all sides of this Oireachtas on the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and we must respect them all.  What Deputy Harkin said about the choice of language used on all sides is also very important.<\/p><p>The 2018 Act enables women who need it to have access to termination of pregnancy services in a safe manner in our own community, where possible, and to have this service free of charge.  The legislation provides for termination to be carried out in cases where there is a risk of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth, and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.<\/p><p>Termination of pregnancy is a medical procedure.  It involves a medical treatment.  It is therefore best carried out by medical practitioners in a safe and regulated medical environment, which can ensure the best possible outcome for a woman's health.<\/p><p>The purpose of the legislation is not to regulate obstetric procedures which do not constitute termination of pregnancy, nor is it to dictate the practice of obstetrics or of medicine more generally.  Medical practitioners are always required to maintain professional standards and to uphold medical ethics.  They are bound through professional regulatory mechanisms to deliver medical services in accordance with the best medical practice.  However, the detail of best medical practice is set out in clinical guidelines rather than in primary legislation.  It is not appropriate to insert compulsory care pathways or treatment plans in legislation.<\/p><p>  A review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is under way.  This review will assess if the termination of pregnancy services provided for in the legislation are being delivered and will identify any barriers or issues with the effectiveness of these services.  Women who use the service, our health professionals who deliver the services, members of the public and members of stakeholder groups can input into the review and outline any concerns they have with the operation of the 2018 Act.  The review will allow a detailed examination of the provisions of the Bill to be undertaken, receive expert evidence and make recommendations on the operation of the 2018 Act.  When the review is concluded a report will be submitted to the Minister for Health for consideration.  He plans to submit the final report on the review to the Government with a request it be referred to the Oireachtas for discussion.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is recommended by the Government to urge the House to decline to accept this Private Members' Bill to be read a Second Time and allow time for the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500018#Q00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1639568520,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this Bill.  I questioned the Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, yesterday to find out what was happening with regard to this Bill and I was disappointed the Government decided at such a late hour to oppose it.  It would not even give it an airing to be read a Second Time.  I am very sad this Bill is even necessary but today&rsquo;s debate is not about opening a wider discussion.  It is about trying to find some common ground and ensuring, at a minimum, no baby is ever forced to die from abortion while suffering excruciating pain.  The Minister did not reassure me of that in any make, shape or form.  He said pain relief can be included in the review.  It is not a matter of &quot;can&rdquo;.  We have it for animals.  It should and must be included in the review.<\/p><p>Regardless of where colleagues in the House stand on the issue of abortion, I call on them to treat this Bill separately, to look at the scientific evidence coming to light with regard to foetal pain and to support this small but compassionate proposal that will achieve one thing and one thing only, namely, it will ensure unborn babies do not have to endure unnecessary pain and distress during late-term abortions.  That is all it is about.  I will not even reply to other Deputies&rsquo; attacks about it.  I do not mind being called right-wing or anything else if it means we get humanity and pain relief for a human being.  If we cannot stand for that, where is our moral fibre?<\/p><p>Since the abortion legislation was passed in 2018, new research has been published confirming the reality of foetal pain from 20 weeks' gestation and suggesting unborn babies likely feel pain even much earlier than that, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said.  As legislators, we cannot ignore what the scientific research is saying.  The evidence is becoming clearer each day that unborn babies feel pain, but even if some colleagues remain to be convinced of that, that is not a reason to oppose the Bill.  If there is even the slightest possibility an unborn baby could suffer pain and distress during a late-term abortion, that should be a sufficient reason to back this Bill in terms of humanity.  <\/p><p>The truth, however, is that the situation is not as vague or unclear as some might suggest.  The facts are clear that unborn babies do feel pain and we should act to alleviate it wherever possible.  I would strongly urge colleagues to look at the expert testimonies from medical consultants and sonographers before congressional hearings in the US on the issue.  The testimonies of women and parents at the same hearings whose babies were aborted without receiving pain relief make for particularly difficult viewing, but they tell a story that cannot be ignored if we want to face the truth and act in a humanitarian way.  In one of the Senate hearings in the US, Dr. Gary George, a senior radiologist at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio told the hearings:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhile doing my first ultrasound rotation, I observed my first &quot;selective reduction&quot; procedure, of one of the triplets at about 14-18 weeks.  I observed while the ultrasonographer scanned the three babies and provided live images so that the obstetrician could aim a long needle through the mom&rsquo;s uterus into the chest of one of the baby&rsquo;s hearts in order to make the lethal injection.  As the sharp needle touched the baby&rsquo;s chest, the baby immediately withdrew and started to rapidly move his arms and legs.  The needle was unable to penetrate the chest.  The mother started crying when she saw the horrific live images on the screen.  Her husband told her not to look and the obstetrician instructed our ... [technical team] to turn the screen away from the mother&rsquo;s view to hide the reality of what was happening. <\/blockquote>  <p>Dr. George&rsquo;s testimony continued in that way.  I will refrain from giving the House any more of the graphic details of what he went on to describe, but it is awful stuff.Over and over again, similar testimonies have been given to various public hearings.  We cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening.  We must acknowledge the reality of foetal pain and do something about it.  I salute Deputy Nolan, my colleagues and other Deputies who put their name to our legislation and will support it.<\/p><p>In England right now, a woman who had an abortion at 23 weeks is pursuing a legal challenge on the grounds she was not informed her baby could potentially feel pain at the stage in pregnancy the abortion took place.  Are we going to wait for that to have to happen here?<\/p><p>In addition to ensuring unborn babies are given pain relief before late-term abortions, those considering late-term abortions are entitled to be informed about what the science says with regard to fatal foetal pain.  <\/p> <p>When we shroud the whole issue in secrecy, we do an enormous disservice to women and unborn babies.  I would add that 100 healthcare professionals have recently issued a statement in support of this Bill.  We are not alone in our concern and we know that there is compassion among those working in the health service as well.  It would be much better to be open and honest about this.  Why can we not be open and honest about what is happening?  We know it is happening and there is no point in hiding it.<\/p> <p> It is now routine practice for unborn babies receiving spina bifida operations in the womb to be given pain relief.  The D&aacute;il passed legislation in 2013 placing an obligation on vets to administer pain relief to animals, even during minor procedures, to ensure no animal has to suffer unnecessary pain or distress.  How can we possibly treat unborn babies less humanely than animals?  I remind the House that in Northern Ireland last year, a vet was prosecuted under similar legislation for not administering pain relief.  Have we lost our humanity completely?  Where is our moral compass?  We have it for animals but not for babies.<\/p> <p> We got lectures here about the homeless.  The Independent Deputies and other colleagues who signed this legislation care deeply about the homeless and we will not be lectured by Deputies Cairns and Br&iacute;d Smith.  They will argue that they have compassion.  They are also interested in animal rights but they are opposing the most basic humane, medical treatment for unborn babies.  We are talking about lives, not foetuses as they like to describe them.<\/p> <p> The suggestion that the issue of administering pain relief should be left to clinical guidelines is not satisfactory by any yardstick.  We introduced primary legislation in Ireland in 2013 to ensure that animals are given pain relief.  Why should the provision of pain relief for unborn babies not be given the same recognition in law?  A child in kindergarten could answer that question because it is a no-brainer.  Leaving it to the guidelines that will be introduced is a sure-fire way of guaranteeing that nothing will happen.  Guidelines were promised three years ago when the Government introduced the abortion legislation.  Three years on, there are still no guidelines which is scandalous.  Ensuring that babies receive pain relief before late-term abortions is not something that can be left to chance.  We have to guarantee that it happens.  It belongs in primary legislation, despite what others might say.  Deputy Pringle accused those bringing forward this compassionate Bill of time wasting but one must ask where is his moral compass and that of other Deputies.  This debate belongs in this House and we are entitled to propose legislation when the Government has not issued guidelines.<\/p> <p> This is not a medical issue and it is most certainly not a political issue.  It is a humanitarian issue.  It would be terrible to acknowledge the need for pain relief to be given in every situation involving animals and humans, except for unborn babies.  Why would we single out unborn babies and deny them the right to basic pain relief before their lives are ended by abortion?  I cannot get my mind around it.  We have an opportunity with this Bill to ensure that unborn babies enduring late-term abortion are shown at least a modicum of respect and are not made to suffer unnecessary pain and distress during the abortion.<\/p> <p> I urge my fellow Oireachtas colleagues, particularly members of the Government, not to engage in delaying tactics on this issue.  Let us, for once, do something that needs to be done.  We want to do nothing more than alleviate unnecessary pain and suffering.  That is all we are asking for.  In other jurisdictions they have found a way to administer pain relief to unborn babies.  Why not in Ireland?  If we come together on this issue we can find a way.  This House brought in abortion legislation that some of us opposed.  We accept that legislation but we want to make it humane and to cut out distress for unborn babies.  What this Bill seeks to achieve, and manages to achieve, is a compassionate, humane and practical response to a very tragic situation.  It deserves the full support of this House and I wholeheartedly urge colleagues to vote in its favour today.<\/p> <p> There were 6,666 abortions in the first year.  What a figure.  We know what 666 signifies.  Now the total is over 20,000 and is growing, with approximately 128 per week.  My goodness, our future doctors, scholars, politicians, scientists and entrepreneurs are being denied the right to life but worst of all, they are being denied any bit of dignity or pain relief before the horrific procedure that takes place.  I appeal to the compassion of the Government.  I am very disappointed that the Government has proposed an amendment referring to the review.  The terms of the review have not been finalised and everybody is arguing over them.  The Minister said this morning that this might be included in the review.  Pain relief for unborn babies must be in the review.  It should be the top priority for all of us in every review but three years later, there is no sign of it.  Where is our compassion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500018#Q00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639569120,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639569120,"counter":70,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500019#R00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639569120,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.57 a.m. and resumed at 12.01 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1639569720,"counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500020#S00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1639569720,"counter":73,"content":"<p>There is a crisis in home care services in this State and the Minister's Government refuses to acknowledge it.  The level to which older and vulnerable people are being failed has been exposed by a HIQA report published last night.  That report makes for concerning reading and it calls for a complete overhaul of home care services.  It has highlighted several key areas where the home care scheme is falling down.  Waiting lists are sky-high and almost 5,000 people are waiting for access to home care.  They have been approved, but they are waiting.  These are 5,000 vulnerable people waiting for a carer to be assigned to them.  This is unacceptable.  The situation causes great stress and worry, not only for the people involved but for their families as well.<\/p>  <p>  This is happening because the Government is not resourcing and staffing home care services adequately.  There are simply not enough staff to fill the places available.  This Government can allocate all the funds and all the hours and set up all the schemes that it wishes, and I have seen that in the budget, but that will not work for the people who matter if we do not have the staff in the first place to deliver that home care service.  The result is that far too many people requiring care in their homes wait and wait and wait.  They wait in hospitals when they should be discharged, or they wait at home, struggling and with nobody to help them.  The HIQA report also underlines the urgent need for the regulation of home care services.  A response I received recently to a parliamentary question I had posed to the Department of Health confirmed that the Government has still not established or developed a plan to regulate home support services.  <\/p>  <p>  People will be listening in disbelief today.  They will find it incredible that there is no State oversight of home care services, on which so many of our older and most vulnerable people depend.  In 2021, there is no minimum standard of care for home care services.  That is frightening.  The State continues to wash its hands of its responsibility to ensure a high-quality level of care and protection is provided to those most vulnerable people relying on home care.  It is a damning indictment of not only this Government, but of successive governments over the years as well.  The Government's failure in the area of home care services has real consequences in people's lives.  As I said, older people are being left in hospitals or nursing homes for respite, and they cannot get home.  In my area, 660 people have been approved for home care packages and are still waiting for them.  People in dire need of assistance in their homes feel abandoned.  They are left by themselves to struggle through their days while facing real challenges every hour.  These are people whose mobility is gone in some cases, those who are suffering from dementia or those who are coping with long-term illness.  That is a tough and lonely situation for anyone to be left in.<\/p>  <p>  It is time for the Government to show up for those depending on home care services.  The first thing we must do is to get more staff into the system to ensure that vulnerable people are not left waiting on waiting lists.  This must start with community employment.  There are more than 2,330 vacancies, many of which are related to community health.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment on behalf of this Government to ensure these vital roles will be filled with urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500020#S00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1639569720,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I wish to highlight the ongoing work within the Government and the HSE to address what is an important issue across society.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to establishing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services, which the Department of Health is developing.  It is the view of the Government that many older people want to stay in their own homes instead of going into a long-term accommodation setting.  It is our job and our duty to facilitate that as best we can, and that is why the Government has provided extensive resources in the last two budgets, in particular, to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services for people based on their assessed care needs.  As the Deputy will be aware, that is very much based on the assessment of the needs of each individual.  It is important to point out that the number of people waiting for funding approval of home support provision or for a carer to be assigned has reduced from more than 9,000 at the start of last year to approximately 5,300 at the end of September of this year.  Of course, that is still too many, but it is still a significant reduction in the number of people waiting for funding.  What people want, of course, is access to a service and that is what the Government is committing to providing.  I acknowledge the enormous efforts of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in leading on this issue.  She has committed to establishing a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group to examine workforce challenges in home support services and, indeed, in nursing homes.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out the level of additional funding, &euro;150 million, that has been secured by the Minister of State for home support.  The HSE's national service plan for this year sets a target to provide 24 million home support hours, which is 5 million more hours than were provided for last year.  It was estimated at the end of October this year that some 17 million hours had been provided to approximately 54,000 people, which is about 2.5 million more hours compared to the same period last year.  Notwithstanding the undoubted challenges that exist in recruiting home carers and people to provide this vital service, there has been a significant increase in the level of service and the number of hours provided this year relative to last year.  The funding secured in budget 2021 to provide these additional 5 million hours has been maintained for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the point Deputy Kerrane made about staffing.  It is an ongoing challenge for the HSE to recruit the staff necessary to provide this service.  That can result in delays occurring in the interval between funding approval being given for an individual and the delivery of those home support hours.  We accept that the delivery of the service in people's own homes is what really matters to the people concerned.  There has been a steady increase in the number of people waiting to receive home support in recent months.  It is important to note, however, that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories, namely, those waiting for funding or for a carer to be assigned, has reduced significantly.<\/p>  <p>  I referred earlier to the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group that the Minister of State has committed to establishing.  The role of that group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and to examine workforce challenges in the home support service and nursing homes.  Potential areas to be examined in that context include recruitment, retention, training, career development and the sustainable employment of home care workers for the future.  As the Deputy will be aware, a call for submissions to identify key issues and to inform the establishment of the group was announced recently, on Friday, 3 December.  The project team in the Department will now analyse the submissions received to inform the setting up of this group in early 2022.  We look forward to the support of and engagement by the Deputy regarding how we can make progress on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500020#S00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1639569720,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I note the Minister has made no reference at all to the HIQA report I referred to, which was published last night.  <\/p> <p>It makes for really concerning reading.  It calls for a complete overhaul of these services.  Clearly, it is not working.  The Minister said the waiting time for funding has reduced and that is welcome.  Although people are getting their funding, which is also welcome, they are then moving from a waiting list for funding to a waiting list to actually get that care.  While the funding may be sorted out and there may be reduced waiting times for that, the issue is in actually getting the care.  People are being approved for home care and then they are not getting it.  They are moving from one waiting list to another.  <\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned the additional funding and 24 million home support hours.  Again, that is welcome but not if we have nobody to provide those hours.  Who is going to provide them?  I put forward one example regarding community employment.

I agree with the previous speaker.  In my time in politics I have never seen the issues in home care that I am seeing at the moment.  It is actually impossible.

We have a fantastic nursing home in Roscrea - the Community Hospital of the Assumption.  The Dean Maxwell nursing home is the most important issue for the people of Roscrea.

Under the national development plan, NDP, will funding be provided to deliver on this much-needed home?  Considering how we have come through Covid it is quite obvious that we need more publicly funded nursing homes, as I am sure the Minister will agree.  That is the larger issue.  The more short-term issue is that for a number of nursing homes like the Dean Maxwell, their HIQA registration runs out on 1 January next year and they will not be in a position to take long-stay residents from that date.  Will the Minister confirm in respect of the Dean Maxwell nursing home and other homes equally affected that this action will be postponed and will not be implemented until the NDP review is concluded?  That will allow us to give certainty to the people of Roscrea over Christmas.  I acknowledge that the Minister's colleague, Councillor Michael Smith, has been working very hard on this in Roscrea, in fairness.  We want to know so that the people will know over the Christmas and new year period whether a new NDP will facilitate a new Dean Maxwell home where the local authority and others are willing to work with he HSE to develop it.

It was kept low key as I am sure the Deputy can understand.<\/p>  <p> He mentioned the new HIQA standards in respect of long-term residential care which come into force on 1 January next.  They mean the Dean Maxwell community nursing unit will have continued compliance issues regarding the premises.  It is important to make the point that existing residents will not be required to leave their home by 1 January 2022.  My understanding is that the HSE has given a commitment to continue to admit residents to the Dean Maxwell until such a time as it is directed otherwise by HIQA.  That is a positive development.  I will certainly work with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and Deputies Kelly, Lowry and Cahill from the constituency.  Deputy Cahill accompanied me during my visit to Dean Maxwell.<\/p>  <p>  We understand the HSE's plan for the Dean Maxwell arising out of these HIQA compliance obligations is to develop a larger respite and short-term care facility for north Tipperary and to retain the current day services.  We also recognise that this is not widely supported and there is a determination and a wish for the Dean Maxwell to continue to provide community nursing home services.  We acknowledge that is the desire.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler is personally committed to making progress on this issue and will in the new year meet again with the HSE and local stakeholders with a view to making progress.<\/p>  <p>  What is really needed is an agreed plan for the Dean Maxwell.  If there is an agreed plan, I do not believe that funding will be the impediment.  We have a very large capital envelope set out to 2030 under the NDP, totalling &euro;165 billion.  The challenge across a number of Departments will be to make sure that money is spent.  I want to see projects brought through the various stages of the project life cycle to the point where they can absorb and spend capital. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the ageing population and the pressures that will place on long-stay facilities in the public and private sectors.  I recognise the potential role that the Dean Maxwell can play into the future in meeting those needs.<\/p> <p>What we need is an agreed plan that the HSE is willing to support and seek funding for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500021#T00400","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639570920,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It must be the spirit of Christmas but that was a very good response.

I am not satisfied with the answer.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, for telling me last week that a 12-month extension will be granted.  I have communicated this to the residents and management of the home.  Therefore, there is no new news in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The time for sweet talk on the future of this treasured facility is over.  It is time that we put our cards on the table and gave people the facts.  It is also time for the Government to tell the people of Roscrea whether it will overturn the recommendation of the HSE to rob Roscrea of the security of having a long-stay bed unit.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s recently published national development plan provides for expenditure of up to &euro;1 billion, to be invested in 88 existing nursing homes.  I repeatedly stated in this House that without direct Government intervention, the Dean Maxwell will continue to be downgraded and will not be included in the HSE&rsquo;s list of 88 nursing homes.  Without a clear directive from the Government, the prospects of a new Dean Maxwell are slim to nil.  If the decision is left solely to the HSE, the people of Roscrea will lose their cherished long-stay bed unit.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has its own agenda when it comes to elderly residential care in north Tipperary.  Political manoeuvring in the recent past, which Deputy Kelly will be aware of, ensured that a 50-bed residential unit would be built in Nenagh in the full knowledge that it would lead to a downgrading of the Dean Maxwell unit.  Under the plan, the Dean Maxwell&rsquo;s 25 beds are reallocated to make the Nenagh project viable.  With the stroke of a pen, the well-being and happiness of elderly people in Roscrea was dismissed.  The attitude involved moving the residents to Nenagh from the place they now call home on the basis that will be fine and will be only 20 miles away from the loved ones who support them.  This was done in typical cloak-and-dagger fashion by the HSE.  Queries from me and others were met with evasive responses.  The HSE stonewalled approaches for information and refused point-blank to admit the true position.  It stonewalled approaches for information and refused point-blank to admit the true position.  The executive had its plans under way to close the Dean Maxwell by stealth.  It had neither the courage nor the honesty to admit it.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of consultation with HIQA, the Dean Maxwell was recently granted a 12-month extension to facilitate the build-out of the Nenagh unit.  Importantly, no new residents are being accepted in the Dean Maxwell when a bed is vacated.  That tells its own story.  The people of Roscrea are being wronged and the elderly are being sacrificed.  Roscrea is a town of decent and hard-working people.  It is a tight-knit community where people look out for one another.  They are fiercely loyal to their older citizens.  No one in Roscrea, myself or anyone else begrudges Nenagh a new facility, but the people of Roscrea feel passionately that it should not be at the expense of elderly people in their town.<\/p>  <p>  In my political actions, I have always used reasoned arguments and logic.  In the case of the Dean Maxwell, this approach has met with a deaf ear.  If this attitude and this policy continue, I will encourage and support the people of Roscrea in protest action.  The HSE has sold out on the Dean Maxwell.  It is an agent of the Government and exists to implement Government policy.  Therefore, it is time for the Government to stand up, act and issue a directive to the HSE to make sure long-stay beds remain in the Dean Maxwell.  That is what the issue is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500022#U00600","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1639570920,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I acknowledge the work that he continues to do on this issue along with Deputy Cahill and Councillor Michael Smith, who has rightly been acknowledged for his work.  It is important to highlight what has been confirmed today, which is that the Dean Maxwell can continue from today to admit new residents.  That is a significant and important development.  The HSE has made that decision.  It is subject to caveat in the sense of HIQA instructing it not to do so.  It is important that we work to address the standards issues that have been raised by HIQA.  I visited the Dean Maxwell in the past.  It is a very fine facility.  It undoubtedly needs investment; there is no question about that, but the atmosphere, <i>esprit de corps<\/i>and the work of the staff were very impressive.  I could see it was a very happy environment for the residents, which, at the end of the day, is the most important factor.  The residents were very content and happy and seemed to be really well looked after.  I commend all the staff working at the Dean Maxwell on the work they continue to do.<\/p><p>It is important to underline that, as a Government, we are fully committed to exploring all available options regarding the Dean Maxwell.  We will work with the HSE proactively to identify proposals by the centre&rsquo;s future.  It is evident, as has been demonstrated again this afternoon, that there is strong political support for securing a long-term role with the Dean Maxwell as a community nursing facility.  We have heard that message loud and clear, and I am sure that the HSE has also heard it.<\/p><p>It is worth highlighting that, in the Roscrea area, four other nursing homes are funded through the nursing homes support scheme.  Two are within the town limits, as the Deputy will know, being so familiar with the town, and the other two are short distance from the town.  One is towards Thurles and the other is towards Birr.  There is capacity for 110 nursing homes support scheme beds between these four private nursing homes.  The two within the town limits have 62 nursing homes support scheme beds between them.  This capacity will also be complemented with further public long-stay beds in the planned new facility in Nenagh, which the Deputy has highlighted in his contribution.  As he will be aware, the facility is under construction and due for completion in December 2022.<\/p><p>I reiterate, however, that what we need is a long-term solution for the Dean Maxwell.  I do not want this issue to be running sore.  There is strong support within the Government and across this House for a long-term solution for the Dean Maxwell to enable it to continue to provide nursing-home care to residents in the future.

The unit is doomed as it is at present unless there is an explicit and clear directive from the Government to the HSE to develop and bring forward a plan that will include a full range of services and long-stay beds for the town of Roscrea.  The HSE will not take the initiative to refurbish or to replace Dean Maxwell unless it is directed by the Government to do so.

I wish to plead for the artists, the musicians, the ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; and na daoine &oacute;ga agus aosta.  They are so troubled at the moment.  They are penniless.  Why is it that the majority of musicians and workers in the music industry, including lighting engineers, sound engineers and everybody else, are always left out when it comes to supports?  It always seems to be the venues or the big organisations, including the Arts Council, that get funded, and the funding does not trickle down to the grassroots, the music on the ground and the music man or music woman or the one-piece, two-piece, three-piece or four-piece band.  They are penniless now.  With whom does the Government engage when it comes to deciding who gets what?  With whom does the Department with responsibility for arts engage?  The latter is more important as it seems that it is listening to the wrong people.  It is listening to powerful lobby groups and big organisations and they are getting the funding while the man and woman on the ground, as so often happens, are left penniless.  I am pleading with the Government.  Can it get the PUP rolled out such that there are no hoops to jump through?  All the gigs, as we know, have been cancelled on the back of a miserably failed reopening plan that the Government initiated.  Then NPHET's actions, before Cabinet decides on them or the Taoiseach addresses the nation, were leaked.  This devastated every hotel and pub.  Everything was cancelled for Christmas.  Christmas was almost cancelled.  But for the resilience of Santy, the Government would cancel it, and that is a horrible thing to have to say.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has been reduced twice, and now these people have come off the payment in good faith to go back to what they love, to sing, to enhance people's lives, to entertain and to give solace to people.  They tried to do that and then the Government pulled the rug from under their feet.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to get involved today with the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, and others because it is almost Christmas week.  It is our second last day here, and many of these people have sold their vans or some of their equipment.  The banks are now foreclosing on some of their mortgages.  It is an awful situation for these people from Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and all its musicians, led by the wonderful Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, iar-Sheanad&oacute;ir, to people like Willie Bun and Paul Lafford to Dom O'Driscoll and Trudi Lalor.  I could name a string of them all day.  They are in every parish and every townland.  They give of themselves.  They give solace to the people longing for music, song and dance.  They have been locked up and incarcerated for 19 months, facing a second similar Christmas, and they need that stimulation.  It is part of our culture and heritage.  Is the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, going to wipe it out?  Has she some kind of death wish against these people?  She will not deal with them.  She will not talk to them.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, met them, and I appreciate the bona fides of the Minister, Deputy Martin, but I believe there is some issue with senior officials in her Department who are not allowing these small people, these wonderful people to perform.  I do not mean small in stature.  My God, their stature is huge because of the mental health issues they resolve and the solace and well-being they give to people in getting them out there listening to songs and having a dance and a bit of craic.  That is all they want.  They are not robbing people.  The venues are very cheap.  The venues also are getting hammered but my plea today is on behalf of these musicians.

The MEAI, to which the Deputy referred, was in attendance at that meeting and fully participated in and spoke at it, so there has been and continues to be ongoing engagement.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, has always advocated very strongly around the Cabinet table and in all her bilateral engagements for this sector because she and all of Government recognise that it has been among the most impacted since March 2020.  We want to protect all elements of our culture and heritage, including traditional music, which I know the Deputy enjoys so much.  It is such an important part of the fabric of Irish society.  That is why we have brought forward a lot of supports.  The way in which they translate and work their way through to individual musicians can sometimes be a challenge, which we accept, but in recent weeks, as the Deputy knows, the Minister outlined a further package for the live entertainment sector.  This comprises &euro;5 million for the seasonal musical theatre and pantomime scheme and another round of the live performance support scheme, which has enabled so many different events and live performances to take place.  There will be further funding for that in the fourth round that will come in the months ahead.  There has been additional funding as well for local authorities to support local artists and local performances through the local live performance support scheme.  We are also providing funding to venues for capital supports to enable them to upgrade their premises to be able to continue to operate to the maximum degree possible within the confines of the public health guidelines we have.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge that the public have responded to the public health messaging over the past number of weeks, and the sector that has had to carry the burden of that has been the night-time economy, the live entertainment and hospitality sector.

Do not worry.  I just wanted to clarify we have 15 minutes.<\/p>  <p>  Something interesting has come to my attention about the census.  Given the scale of the housing crisis in this country, there has quite correctly been a focus for quite some time, extending to years, on the question of vacant and derelict properties in the country.  Many people, including me, have for some time been asking that as part of trying to address that crisis we identify the number of vacant and derelict properties.  Many Deputies have time and again cited the number of such properties in their own areas, towns and villages, along with their frustration and that of the people that these properties are not being used to house people affected by the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I have learned something because a person has been communicating with my office and the CSO.  In the previous census, in 2016, the CSO did not do any count of derelict properties.  It did a count of vacant properties and the figures were fairly eye-watering, identifying 183,312 such properties.  It is a pretty staggering number and if even a reasonable portion of them could be quickly turned around, refurbished and made available to people affected by the housing crisis, it would have a very significant impact on it.  What is apparent from the correspondence I have received from this person, who is communicating with me and the CSO, is that eye-watering figure of vacant properties did not include derelict properties.  That means there is a very significant number beyond that of derelict properties that could also potentially be used for housing.<\/p>  <p>  A note from the CSO indicates dwellings under construction and derelict properties were not included in the count of vacant dwellings, and as a result empty housing units were classed as a vacant house, vacant apartment or holiday home only if the dwelling was considered fit for habitation by the enumerator.  In the case of newly constructed buildings, this meant the roof, doors, windows and walls had to be completely built or installed and for older dwellings that were unoccupied, the roof, doors and windows had to be fully intact.<\/p>  <p>  We can think about this even with the most cursory walk down the streets of Dublin or anybody's town or village.  We can imagine many of the older buildings with a broken window or a door or window boarded up that were not counted in the 2016 census, despite that census identifying an absolutely staggering 183,000 vacant units.  It was apparent in yesterday's Oireachtas committee meeting when Dublin City Council officials were questioned on the matter that they did not have a clue.  The biggest local authority in the country has no clue about derelict properties in Dublin city.  It has done one walk-around survey of approximately 45 properties in 2015 and that was it.  There is no working definition of derelict properties.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to take this very seriously.  It is a matter of urgency for us to identify the housing stock that could potentially be useful for addressing the incredibly severe housing crisis we are now facing.  We need a working definition and absolute certainty that derelict properties will be included in the census to be conducted in 2022.  Frankly, local authorities should be instructed before that to have an operating definition of derelictions and should have a systematic and scientific approach to identifying them even before that because it is an absolute scandal there are so many vacant and derelict buildings.  We cannot even begin that work unless we have a clear definition of what a derelict site is and the properties are being counted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500028#AA00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1639574520,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and acknowledge the points he raises.  There was a consultation process and pilot survey and the Government decided on new questions and structure for the census that was meant to run this year.  The questions have already been set, as agreed by the Government in 2019, and the process is being operationalised.  Much of the material being used by the enumerators has already been printed and the structure of the process has been formalised.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the distinction between vacant and derelict properties.  He is correct in saying we need greater detail.  I did not see yesterday's contribution from Dublin City Council but I know from my experience as a member of the local authority in Fingal a number of years ago that there must be an updated register of what is a derelict property.  I will certainly bring the Deputy's feedback to the CSO but there is an obligation on local authorities to work through what is derelict in their area.  I do not have the detail on what definition is being used around vacant properties for the census that is taking place next year but I will ask for it to be sent to the Deputy.  The Deputy mentioned the proceedings of yesterday's Oireachtas committee meeting and it will be important for local authorities to follow through on their obligations around the Housing for All plan and the importance of utilising both vacant, stocked and derelict properties to ameliorate the ongoing housing shortage.<\/p>  <p>  The Government approval on content was granted in July 2019 and it set out the layout, design and structure of questions, as well as guidelines for enumerators.

As the Deputy knows, it is an enormous operation.  I will ask the CSO to engage with the Deputy nonetheless and I will try to get further detail on the current definition of a vacant property and the broader issue around assessment of derelict properties.  The census is one element but the CSO has a broader remit around data collection so I will ask for further detail on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500028#AA00800","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639574520,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.28 p.m. and resumed at 2.28 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Instruction to Committee","time":1639575120,"counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500029#HH00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1639575120,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat pursuant to Standing Order 233, Standing Order 187 is modified to provide that it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in relation to the Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, that the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the scope of the existing subject matter of the Bill, in relation to:  \t(<i>a<\/i>) strengthening the regulatory framework for the promotion of tree planting as part of a scheme by removing the requirement for an afforestation licence for: <blockquote> \t(i) an area of not less than 0.1 hectare and not greater than 1 hectare, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) an area of not less than 0.1 hectare that is not greater than 20 metres in width <\/blockquote>where the trees concerned are native tree species only, of which not more than 25 per cent are Scots pine; and<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the introduction of a provision so that the Minister may make Regulations to provide for a native tree area Scheme and supporting grants;<br \/><br \/>and to make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.<\/p><p>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to outline a number of amendments to the Forestry Act 2014 to increase the planting of native trees.  The programme for Government outlines our commitment to addressing the urgent need to increase the level of tree-planting.  We acknowledge our planting targets are ambitious and we need to improve significantly on the rate at which we issue licences.  These changes are part of a number of work areas my Department is considering to review processes and examine in more detail the regulatory regime while safeguarding the environment.<\/p><p>The proposal today is designed to remove a legislative barrier to small-scale native tree-planting.  The inclusion of small-scale native tree-planting measures in agriculture and forestry schemes is currently constrained by the 0.1 ha limit imposed by the definition of a forest in the Forestry Act 2014.  Approval is sought to amend the Forestry Act 2014 through the Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 to expand the native tree-planting areas as part of a scheme by removing the requirement for an afforestation licence for an area of not less than 0.1 ha and not greater than 1 ha, or an area of not less than 0.1 ha that is not greater than 20 m in width.<\/p><p>This will complement existing tree-planting measures and aims to re-engage farmers in afforestation and to play a part in meeting the ambitious roadmap towards climate neutrality, as outlined in the recently published climate action plan.  Our afforestation targets are ambitious when compared with recent afforestation rates and will be challenging to meet in the next decade.  Clearly, more needs to be done to increase our afforestation rates substantially over the next decade, including achieving greater integration between the measures in the national forestry programme and the Common Agricultural Policy.  These measures are not a substitute for the ongoing work to reform the licensing process or for planting afforestation sites, which remain a priority for the Department.  Instead, they are another part of the solution that will assist in getting trees planted on Irish farms.<\/p><p>Woodlands and trees provide a wide range of benefits that include social, environmental and economic values.  Ireland has 11% forest cover in addition to the many individual trees found growing in hedgerows, parks and fields.  Trees play an important role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity.  Creating new native woodlands and undisturbed water setbacks can deliver meaningful ecosystem services that protect and enhance water quality and aquatic ecosystems.  The creation of these permanent semi-natural landscape features alongside streams, rivers and lakes will protect and enhance water quality and aquatic habitats into the future.<\/p><p>I will now provide the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, with the opportunity to comment further on why these proposals are important. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500029#HH00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639575120,"counter":164,"content":"<p>As Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the importance of planting of trees, and in particular our native trees.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets an ambitious afforestation target when compared with recent afforestation rates and will be challenging to meet in the next decade.  However, the Department is committed to addressing the current barriers that have resulted in low afforestation rates for all plantation sizes and these measures are part of the solution.<\/p>  <p>  A key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is to build back confidence among landowners regarding the benefits of forestry and to provide greater integration on Irish farms.  Introducing this exemption for afforestation in certain circumstances facilitates the exclusion of clearly defined activities from requiring an afforestation licence.  These changes will provide opportunities for those engaged in afforestation to increase awareness among farmers who have not considered any tree-planting in the past.  The design of any initiatives to utilise these measures will have to ensure compliance with all environmental law such as the environmental impact assessment, EIA, habitats and water framework directives.  This measure will not allow tree-planting to take place that is not in accordance with best practice.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the development of a scheme, the Department will undertake a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and an appropriate assessment.  Furthermore, through scheme criteria and with advisory structures and approval processes in place, the inclusion of such an exemption can be undertaken only in a legally compliant and sustainable manner.  If these changes are approved, the Department will carry out an SEA, which will include mandatory consultation with statutory bodies, the public and interested stakeholders.  These proposed changes will have a positive impact on the environment and increase the levels of native tree-planting.<\/p>  <p>  The focus on native tree species is to recognise the important environmental role they play in respect of climate change, biodiversity and water quality.  The afforestation scheme will remain the main measure for planting native and commercial woodland at scale.  Large forests of all species play a significant role in carbon sequestration and it is hoped that, if a farmer plants 1 ha, he or she may be encouraged to plant larger areas in future through our afforestation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate, however, that some Deputies may argue we need to address the current licensing backlogs and I assure them this remains my priority.  The Department is committed to addressing the current barriers that have resulted in low afforestation rates in the past.  Project Woodland, which has been established, is making good progress.  We are examining a number of work streams, including a focus on reducing the backlog in licensing, as well as existing regulations and efficiencies in work processes.<\/p>  <p>  Once this legislation has been enacted, we will carry out stakeholder consultation on the design of any proposed scheme and discuss how we can ensure maximum participation.  The public and statutory bodies will also be provided with an opportunity to engage in the mandatory public consultation process required for the development of an SEA.  Furthermore, the SEA will inform the development of the scheme eligibility criteria.  In addition, the amended legislation can facilitate additional tree-planting in agri-environmental schemes and measures where tree-planting measures were historically capped below 0.1 ha.  The role of registered foresters, agricultural consultants and advisers will be important when the schemes are being developed and we will engage with them over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  Streamlining the process for small native tree-planting will involve the landowner or his or her agent assessing and submitting applications that meet the eligibility criteria, which will be subjected to validation checks to ensure compliance.  Once the Department has confirmed compliance with the eligibility criteria, it will issue approval to undertake tree-planting works.  Following completion of the approved works, the landowner will submit an application for grant aid.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is in line with the programme for Government commitments to planting trees on areas of 1 ha and it will also enable the further planting of native trees.  I encourage all Deputies to support this amendment.  It is one part of the solution to increase tree-planting.  Project Woodland is addressing a number of other areas of improvements that contribute to increasing our afforestation levels now and in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500029#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)"},{"type":"speech","time":1639575120,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome any proposals aimed at increasing native tree-planting and encouraging smaller levels of afforestation among those who may not be willing or able, in the current climate, to take a leap towards greater levels of planting.  Even so, the manner in which this proposal has been brought forward so late in the day, as an amendment to legislation that will ban fur-farming, is a matter of great concern.  It is symptomatic of the manner in which forestry policy is dealt with in this State.  It is not good legislative practice and it is not the type of approach Sinn F&eacute;in believes is conducive to the development of good legislation.  We in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine received a draft copy of the proposal on Friday and today received a briefing from officials, which was welcome, and we will debate Committee Stage in the House at a later point.<\/p>  <p>  One forester has been quoted as giving the assessment that this is another hospital pass from the forest service of the Department to the forestry industry in a decade-long litany of hospital passes, which has left this once-great indigenous rural-based industry in tatters.  That rings true when we read the briefing note that was circulated with the motion.  It refers to the climate action plan's aim for afforestation of 8,000 ha per year until 2030 as being ambitious when compared with the recent afforestation rate.  It is important to acknowledge, however, that the climate action plan does not outline a target of 8,000 ha of afforestation.  In fact, it does not make any reference to a target.  In the annex to the plan published yesterday, again that target is not referenced.  As for the target of 8,000 ha per year being described as incredibly ambitious, it might be ambitious when compared with the catastrophe we are currently dealing with but it is nowhere near the level of ambition we would want.<\/p>  <p>  When we compare ourselves with some of our neighbours, we can safely say the target is not ambitious at all.  Two years on from its Mackinnon report, Scotland had reached its pre-crisis levels of afforestation, whereas two years on from our Mackinnon report, almost to the day, this State's afforestation rates have not doubled but halved.  Ten years on from its Mackinnon report, Scotland is targeting 15,000 ha, almost double the pre-collapse level, while ten years on from our report, we will be targeting only the level that was planted prior to afforestation.  Rather than putting in place the mechanisms and measures that will see an ambitious afforestation programme and targets met, we are tinkering at the edges to bring in a pile of smaller holdings to try to mitigate the bad look of what can only be described as a record failure.<\/p>  <p>  The briefing note that was provided on this amendment refers also to Project Woodland examining a number of work streams, and here lies the crux of the issue.  The Mackinnon report did not call for a body to be established to examine the findings of an implementation report based on the initial report.<\/p> <p>It called for actions to be taken but, as we have seen time and again, the can is kicked down the road as one report is followed by another.  Some of the work streams that were described will not report until the middle of next year at the earliest.  By the time there is action, it will have taken the Government at least three years to implement a report the implementation of which was supposed to be measured in months.<br\/><br\/>Supports for native broadleaf planting certainly are to be welcomed.  However, if this is the Government's big idea, it amounts to a hospital pass and will have little meaning for much of the forestry sector  Currently, the greatest obstacle to afforestation in the State is the licensing backlog within the Department's forestry unit.  With a current target of 100 licences per week, the Department is, in effect, surrendering to the fact it has no intention of clearing that backlog by the end of next year.  The annexe to the climate action plan references increasing the output of forestry licences by quarter 4 of 2020 to meet demand.  Will the Minister indicate the target output per week for next year?  Is it intended to meet the target under the spring legislative agenda that will be brought forward in a few weeks?  Will the Government begin work on legislation to provide applicants for forestry licences a statutory period in which they can expect a decision?  If the backlog is to be cleared by 2022, there is no longer any excuse for not providing such a measure.  There is no reason the Department should fail to begin preparing such legislation without delay.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned at the outset, what is happening with the bringing forward of this motion is far too symptomatic of the general approach.  Last year, we had emergency legislation on the appeals process in respect of which all parties in this House and the Oireachtas committee waived their right to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is all too familiar that we are now dealing with an amendment to legislation that has no relation to forestry.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge in his closing remarks that this is not the best way of doing business.  There is too much latitude being given to him that he has not earned in terms of the trust of this House.  In respect of the schemes, I ask that we not be left to wake up on a Wednesday in the new year to read about them in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>before receiving telephone calls from constituents asking how they meet their needs.  That is the playbook the Department follows all the time.  It leaks selectively about schemes but it does not engage with Members unless and until it is essential, namely, when it wants to bring forward legislation within a short timeframe.  Our support is then sought and is given to allow the measures to go forward.<br\/><br\/>We need a partnership process.  We need the forestry sector to be central to that and we need environmental groups and communities to be part of all the dialogue that takes place.  We must have an increased volume of tree planting, including of native broadleaf trees, across the State.  Any measures to deliver that end certainly are welcome but it is time to leave the disingenuousness and play-acting to one side and get real about this.  I hope this is the last time we see this type of stunt being pulled.  We do not need any more last-minute measures.  We must have a long-term strategic plan that delivers on afforestation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500029#HH00400","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639575720,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The Labour Party is serious about taking measures to tackle the climate crisis and ensuring we meet our ambitious but necessary targets on climate.  As such, we welcome any proposals to increase tree planting and afforestation, particularly native tree planting and woodland cover.  We see that increase in forest cover as an essential component of actions to meet our climate targets, especially given that Ireland's forest cover is among the lowest of any county in the EU.  I understand the figure is 11%, compared with an EU average of more than one third.  Sadly, just under 2%, or approximately 20,000 ha of that 11% is native woodland, of which only tiny fragments are original ancient forests, which covered 80% of this island just after the most recent ice age.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that we are willing to support the motion but we have concerns about the process.  It is unfortunate that it is coming to us at such a late stage and in connection with completely different legislation.  It is not good legislative practice, particularly in the last sitting week before Christmas, to see a motion brought forward in this way, with so little advance consultation.  Many of us have been alerted to the concerns raised by the Social, Economic, Environmental Forestry Association, SEEFA, about the process by which this is being introduced.  There are valid concerns around the process.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I agree that we need to take urgent action to ensure we meet targets, particularly on afforestation.  I welcome today's publication of the detailed annexe to the climate action plan, which is something I have sought in this House on a number of occasions over recent months, particularly since the publication of the plan.  We are all very conscious, and even the Government would acknowledge, that the plan was big on aspirations but lacked the detailed timelines on delivery of necessary actions.  It lacked the level of detail that could only be supplied in a more detailed annexe.  It is welcome to see that produced today.  When I raised this with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in the House last week, I had a suspicion that it might not be published until after the D&aacute;il had risen.  Instead, it has been published on the second-last day of the D&aacute;il term, which is not ideal.  It is unfortunate that we will not have an opportunity to debate the annexe in full before the House rises.  Even on a preliminary look at the document and the timelines provided, there are disappointments, including in respect of bringing in regulations on e-scooters and e-bikes.  There are some very welcome measures on the transport side to increase cycling infrastructure, active travel and public transport provision, but we are seeing many delays and a lagging behind.  There certainly is not the necessary sense of urgency we had hoped for in the annexe.  I hope we have an opportunity early in the new year to debate more fully the annexe, the afforestation targets and other targets set out within it and the associated timelines.  I certainly will be looking for that debate through the Business Committee.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the motion, we all have concerns about the licensing backlog.  Indeed, I raised it in the House on 9 December when I asked the Minister about the number of afforestation licences issued, on which we had an engagement and debate.  Many colleagues, on both sides of the House, shared my concern about that backlog and the delays in the delivery of ambitious projects such as Project Woodland, welcome though it is.  The Minister acknowledged last week that what has been lacking to date in the forestry sector is a co-ordinated and joined-up afforestation policy that fits within the climate action plan and helps to deliver the necessary climate action targets.  In that context, we should all be concerned not only about low levels of native woodland cover, as I mentioned, but also that we continue to cut down more trees than we are planting.  For every acre of forestry that is planted, approximately 6.7 acres are cut down.  That needs to change if we are to meet our ambitious but necessary targets.  I raise these concerns and reservations in the context of supporting the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500030#JJ00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1639575720,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Cahill.  I welcome the motion in many aspects, as I would welcome any change that will improve animal welfare and afforestation.  Regarding the phasing out of fur farming, it is fair to say this is a case of the law catching up with societal changes.  The majority of people are deeply uncomfortable with the idea that an animal would be raised for the purpose of using its fur or skin.  While there was a time this was acceptable and fur clothing was sought after, we have moved on.  As a country of animal lovers, it is overdue that we phase out this practice.  The motion provides a mechanism to compensate those whose livelihoods depend on fur farming.  It is a fair approach that acknowledges the impact of the legislation.  It represents the types of arrangements we need to help farmers and others move from one practice to another.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments to the Forestry Act are a sensible and overdue change that will allow for the small-scale planting of native trees as part of agriculture and forestry schemes.  I have advocated for this measure to encourage farmers and landowners to increase the afforestation of native broadleaf varieties.  Sections of forestry on all farms will not only help to increase our overall afforestation goals but will foster greater biodiversity and facilitate wildlife corridors.<\/p> <p>As I have mentioned previously in the House, there is an aversion to planting trees on farms in Ireland.  It is something we did on our farm approximately 15 years ago when dairying became unviable because of the change in the industry and how small our farm was.  As I have said previously, during the election campaign somebody said they would not vote for me because we had ruined that farm with trees.  We still farm half of it with beef but the focus of the farm is now seed production.  Even though there was resistance to doing it in the first place, the forestry is now our favourite part of the farm.  People should give it a chance.<\/p> <p> These legislative changes are important to address the concerns of farmers who have called for greater assistance and less bureaucracy in facilitating tree planting.  The policy and regulatory changes that will follow this legislation need to adhere to this principle to enable as many small farms as possible to avail of the schemes.  However, this move cannot detract from the need to clear the forestry licensing backlogs and the greater afforestation strategy.  We need consistency from the Government on these issues.<\/p> <p> I have sought clarification on the &euro;7 million in capital expenditure that is due to be moved from forestry budget.  I am working with the community in Riverstick, County Cork to prevent the sale of a substantial part of the public forest.  I would appreciate if the Minister and Minister of State would look into this.  At a time we are trying to meet our COP 26 obligations, why should public forestry containing mixed species be sold?  I do not know how we square that circle with our commitments.<\/p> <p> While the amendments to allow small-scale native tree planting is a positive development, we need it to form a part of an holistic forestry approach.  Unfortunately, I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine, but I have spoken to members.  It seems these two changes coming together at the last minute is unexpected and unexplained.  I echo their calls for clarity and more information.  An explanation in the reply from the Minister or Minister of State would be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500030#JJ00300","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639576320,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cairns for sharing her time.

This morning's briefing was very beneficial to the members and we greatly appreciate it.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the amendments relating to small plantations on farms.  I welcome that farmers will not need to go through a rigorous procedure when trying to get a licence to plant small areas their farm.  It has a part to play in addressing climate change and reducing our emissions.  However, we need to have a commercial forestry industry.  The programme for Government has a target of 8,000 ha per annum.  I plead with the Ministers to keep that target in place for commercial forestry.  As it stands there is a requirement to have certain number of native trees in commercial forestry.  However, without Sitka spruce we cannot have a commercial industry.  We do not want to have to import timber in large quantities.  We want to be able to keep our mills running for the production of timber and for our country.  We have a tremendous ability to grow timber in this country.  We can grow Sitka spruce more efficiently than any other country and we cannot lose sight of that.  Whether it is to keep timber contractors in work or to keep the nurseries running, we need to have this 8,000 ha target for commercial forestry.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever farm planting is done will be most welcome and will help in reducing emissions and meeting our climate targets.  However, at the end of the day these will not be commercial ventures.  No timber contractor will come along in 25 or 30 years to cut half a hectare or a hectare; it would not be viable to cut it commercially.  Our forestry industry has great benefits for rural areas as an employer.  It is an indigenous industry with much to offer.  We have had a serious shortfall in afforestation in recent years and we are only meeting 25% of our targets in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine has had numerous meetings over the past 12 months.  Some of the issues have been ironed out, but the level of afforestation remains exceptionally low.  I do not want the afforestation of small plots of land by farmers to be used to camouflage the serious shortfall in commercial afforestation.  This industry is a major employer in rural areas and has much to offer, especially in areas where the land quality is not up to the same standard as in other parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome these amendments, which will allow farmers to plant small parcels of land without the hassle of applying for licences, I stress that our target of 8,000 ha for the commercial industry needs to be kept intact.

However, as others have said, there is concern about the way this has been sprung on people and the lack of consultation with stakeholders who are concerned with forestry, including those in the industry and environmentalists.  I have my sources in forestry and they usually contact me if anything is moving.  They have not heard any word of this and they are on top of everything.  That is a problem and there are concerns about it.<\/p>  <p>  As others have said, measures like this cannot be used to camouflage our failures in other areas or to substitute for the necessary action that needs to take place in other areas where we are failing.  The backlog in the issuing of licences has been mentioned as a major concern.  Net deforestation may take place in the country, as suggested by the greater number of felling licences being issued compared with a fraction of that for afforestation licences.  A few years ago, the EPA signalled that it believed there was a danger of net deforestation because felling was happening essentially dictated by market concerns rather than by the best stewardship and guardianship of forestry. <\/p>  <p>  I recently flagged another concern with the threatened sale of Killegar Forest near Enniskerry, from which I am glad Coillte backed off.  However, it posed very serious questions.  I subsequently tabled parliamentary questions trying to understand what on earth possessed Coillte to imagine that it might be a good idea to sell an amenity forest when we are supposed to be meeting climate and biodiversity targets.  There was a similar threat to a forest close to Kinsale, County Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Coillte is carrying out significant sales on an ongoing basis.  That is linked to the mandate of Coillte, which at one level we are told is trying to pivot towards biodiversity and so on, but in reality much of what it does is about clear-felling and then replanting 90% to 95% with Sitka spruce, perpetuating a failed forestry model and not doing much in the way of active afforestation.  Against that background, its selling of amenity forests makes no sense and suggests something is fundamentally wrong with the mandate of Coillte, it being operated on a sort of commercial basis.<\/p> <p>The other issue, which relates to Deputy Cahill's point, is that I would like to think we could break from the Sitka spruce industrial forestry model.  If we are to do that, which I think we have to for climate, biodiversity and all sorts of reasons, it must also be a new forestry model that delivers a decent living for farmers engaged in forestry which at the moment many feel can only be delivered by the Sitka spruce monocultural model.  We need to break from that, while also giving real supports to farmers to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500031#KK00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639576920,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I wish to focus on the underlying issue of the Bill, which is the central issue, that is, the ban on fur farming.  I will make two points on that.  One, there needs to be a just transition for workers engaged in these industries that will have to be shut down and for which we have been campaigning for a long time to shut down.  It is not just an issue of redundancy payments.  It is also a question of alternative employment and retraining, as is the case with fossil fuel workers who will lose their jobs in the context of a just and rapid transition.  It is essential that ordinary workers do not lose out as a result of doing the right thing in terms of animal rights.<\/p>  <p>  Second, this is a victory for campaigning.  It is a consequence of the campaigning by the National Animal Rights Association and the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as well as statements from Veterinary Ireland and many other campaigning organisations.  This came about as a direct consequence of a Bill put forward by People Before Profit-Solidarity which sought to ban fur farming.  That pushed the Government, together with the campaigning from outside the House, to move to impact this measure.  It shows we can win when we campaign.<\/p>  <p>  That brings me to my next point which is that the next emerging issue in terms of animal rights in this country will be the Bill, which will be moved at Second Stage next year, to ban hare coursing.  It seeks to ban the cruel practice that leads to tens of unnecessary deaths and hundreds of unnecessary injuries to and mauling of hares every year when hare coursing takes place.  It is a practice with no support from the public.  Some 77% of people agree with banning it.  The question for the Green Party will be whether it will go against its long-term policy of supporting a ban on hare coursing and back its partners in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael by voting against the ban.  It is a question for the Labour Party that likes to talk from time to time about animal rights but has still not given a commitment to support it, and for Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies who had a motion before their last AGM, which was taken off the agenda, to change their party's policy and support a ban on hare coursing.<\/p>  <p>  Those who have been watching what happened in the North in relation to the motion on fox hunting will perhaps not be feeling very optimistic.  The attempt to ride two horses at once reached its zenith with Deputy Carthy's appearance on the radio where he attempted to say that Sinn F&eacute;in was opposed to a ban on fox hunting because of biodiversity, which makes no sense whatsoever.  I appeal to campaigners to take heart from what happened yesterday in Stormont regarding the vote on abortion.  Sinn F&eacute;in can come under pressure.  Animal rights campaigners and members within Sinn F&eacute;in who support a ban on hare coursing should put pressure on the party leadership and tell them not to be on the wrong side of history on this issue and ask them to support a ban on hare coursing when it comes before the House next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500032#LL00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1639576920,"counter":174,"content":"<p>This Bill seeks to ban fur and skin farming of certain animals.  The explanatory memorandum published by the Oireachtas states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...there is now a broad consensus among veterinary and other scientific experts that certain animals should not be farmed for their fur or skin because of serious animal welfare concerns that cannot be mitigated.  There are also increasing serious societal concerns in this regard. <\/blockquote>  <p>First of all, I am always very concerned about the use of phrases such as &quot;a broad consensus&quot;.  History and current events should display very clearly the dangers of using broad consensus as a way of justifying decisions.  By way of example, 20 months ago we were told there was a broad consensus not to wear masks, but a few weeks later they were made compulsory.  More recent, only a few weeks ago, there was a broad consensus from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, that antigen testing was not worth a damn.  In fact, the terms used was &quot;snake oil&quot;.  The broad consensus now is they should be mandatory.  There was a broad consensus at the start of the vaccination programme that two doses would be enough, and now the so-called broad consensus is we need at least three and maybe more.  Recent events alone should warn us against making law based on notions such as broad consensus.<\/p><p>If we look more carefully at the arguments in favour of supporting this Bill, I would be very concerned that, in the future, similar arguments might be used to try to ban or curtail more mainstream farming of animals.  We already hear talk of the ridiculous notion that limiting or reducing the total herd in Ireland will somehow make a material impact on climate change.  We see through the withholding of Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments until certain eco schemes are put in place that farmers are being targeted in an unfair manner.<\/p><p>The reason, of course, the fur farming Bill will receive Government support is partly as a compromise to get the Green Party on board in Government negotiations, but also because it is an easy and relatively non-controversial way of making a government look compassionate.  There are only three fur farms in Ireland so it will not be a big vote loser for any party in Government, but it sets a very concerning precedent.  I welcome the provision of a compensation scheme for those affected, because they will need it if this Bill is passed, but we cannot take away people's livelihoods without ensuring they are financially compensated.  I ask the Government to bear in mind with regard to licence holding and salmon drift net fishers that it might ensure they are compensated.<\/p><p>Section 6 contains a definition of a specified animal.  It lists a host of different animals to which this Bill will apply.  It further states the Minister may, by order, designate any animal or class of animal as a specified animal for the purpose of paragraph (h) of the definition of &quot;specified animal&quot; in subsection (1).  That gives the Minister the power to add any animal he or she likes to which this legislation applies without ever having to consult the House again.  That concerns me in terms of what might lie before us in future.

We could take a stance on different issues, but at the end of the day we must talk about animal welfare and how animals are treated and protected.  If fur farming, which is the focus of this Bill, is to close down, how will the people who currently make a livelihood from it in a licensed way transition out of that area and be compensated?<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to the debate in the Chamber today.  This morning there was a debate about pain relief for unborn babies.  There was an outcry from certain Deputies that what we were doing was wrong.  My God, if people say we cannot give pain relief to children when it comes to the late stage of pregnancies or they say we should not interfere, only for the same people to want the welfare of animals to be the top priority, we need to recalibrate our thinking on all of this.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will set a precedent that would not be good.

They are jumping out on the roads, hitting cars and whatever.  That is endangering life.  We need to do something about that.<\/p> <p> If we put things in an order of priority, there are a hell of a lot of things we need to do before doing this.  I will go back to the point I made initially.  We were here this morning talking about pain relief for unborn children who have heartbeats.

For a long time, it thought it was the case that Department officials were lagging.  Others thought that objectors were causing the delay in the issuing of felling licences.  However, I now honestly feel that it is the Government and these Ministers that have the whole thing completely finished.  I always say what it is in my head and I honestly believe the Ministers do not want spruce to be cut, planted or re-planted anywhere and that this is totally contrary to their will.  It goes against the grain for them.  I have nothing against native trees but we need commercial timber as well.  We are now so far behind in issuing felling licences that the price of timber has increased to an unacceptable level which is preventing people from building houses.  A 6 inch by 3 inch stick of timber that was &euro;20 for many years is now &euro;38.  It is the same with every other type of commercial timber.  The prices have practically doubled.  This is having a detrimental effect.  I honestly believe the Ministers do not understand the value of spruce.  We are told that an acre of spruce sequesters 13 tonnes of carbon.  Native trees take much longer to grow.  As I have said, I have nothing against native species but we have to be real about this.  These species only sequester 4 tonnes per acre.<\/p>  <p>  The Ministers have not made one iota of a difference to the felling licence situation or helped it in any way.  I have lost faith in them.  We have spoken about this a great deal but we are still where we were.  People have walked away from planting trees because they see what is happening to the people who want to cut down trees, in some cases because they want the money for real things like sending children to college.  I know of a man who became immobilised and wanted to do up his house and put it in order so that he could manage a wheelchair in it.  He does not have any money because he cannot get a felling licence.  He also cannot get permission to build a road.  I have always said that when you plant a crop, whether barley, oats, spuds or whatever, there must be an ideology that it will be cut down when it is ripe.  That has to be the same for forestry.  They would replant the trees but they cannot because they cannot get a felling licence to cut them.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to wild animals, I concur with Deputy Canney from Galway.  It was sad to hear some of the comments made about us when we were trying to do something about pain relief for little babies.  They are human beings and creatures of God.  Not only did some people not want to hear about the little babies, but they do not want to hear about God either because many of them think they themselves are God and that they do not have to worry about anything.  Their day will come, as will everybody else's.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of wild animals, we are completely overrun with deer in Kerry.  Our roads are not safe.  At 7.15 the other morning, a deer ran out in front of a youngster who had gone to the trouble of getting his driving test, buying a car and getting expensive insurance, and it made flitters of his car, which he gave a lot of money for.  He is finished now.  He cannot go to work because his car has been put out of action before it really got going at all.  Something has to be done about the deer because they have our side of the country totally overrun.  The roads are not safe.  They are eating farmers out of house and home.  We are talking about there not being any fertiliser next year.  For many farmers, there was no good in putting it out anyway because the deer got the benefit of it.<\/p>  <p>  Foxes need to be brought under control in some way as well.  Many here may not realise what happens when a lamb or a couple of lambs are taken by a fox.  It is absolutely horrible.  That is devastating for sheep farmers who work hard and who have to traverse mountains, glens and valleys to look after their sheep.  Every year, 30 or 40 sheep out of every flock finish up without a lamb because of foxes.  That is the gospel truth.  I do not know if the Minister understands that.<\/p>  <p>  We are completely overrun.  There needs to be some policy or Government action taken to deal with the deer and the foxes, and more so the deer because people are being hurt and killed.  A mother of three children was killed coming into Killarney within a half a mile of the centre of the town.  That is the gospel truth.  We need to do something about real issues.  This is the Minister's time.  They are the Ministers at this time, although I do not know for how long.  If they want to prove their worth, they must do something about these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500033#MM00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1639577520,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I will share two and a half minutes of my time with Deputy Kehoe.  I will be fairly brief.  The largest part of this Bill relates to the cull of the mink.  We need not to forget those people because they seem to be kicked to the side in the new amendments that have come in.  Fair compensation must be given to them.  They have worked with the Department in every way.  Some of them will say very clearly the Department has not been as helpful in working with them as it should have been.  Proper compensation must be given to those people, who have facilitated the Department in every way.<\/p>  <p>  A few amendments regarding forestry have been thrown in at the end of this Bill about mink in what we in rural Ireland would call a half-arsed manner.  I cannot get my head around that but this place would baffle you every day.<\/p>  <p>Let us be frank about this and call a spade a spade.  The Minister is bringing in a document, or a way forward, to enable the ticking of a box to say Ireland will reach its target.  A press release can then be issued to say the climate action target of 7,000 ha or 8,000 ha has been achieved.  To be frank about this, though, we will not have done it as we should have done it.  There is one simple reason for that.  Every Deputy here who is a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine will say straight up that we are blue in the face telling the Ministers about the dysfunctionality of the Department in this regard.  It has never reached a target since 2016.  The Ministers, however, persist with the same piano players and therefore they will continue to get the same tune.<\/p> <p> The bottom line is we will all support this Bill.  I do not think anybody has a problem with it.  We have commented on how farmers should be allowed to plant a hectare.  Let us take the example, though, of the region where Deputy Carthy is from.  Why is it the case when an invisible line is crossed into Northern Ireland that farmers can sow three hectares without planning and licences, while farmers in the area where Deputy Carthy is from can do nothing without going through reams of paper and waiting three years for the process to be completed?<\/p> <p> If the Minister or the Minister of State is coming into our committee in the afternoon, I urge them to have answers to these questions.  We are basically being asked to sign a blank cheque at the moment.  When we asked earlier if there was an establishment grant, the answer given was that would be considered down the road when this thing is put together.  It was the same when we asked if there would be so much money given each year.  The answer again was that would be decided down the road, when the terms and conditions of this scheme are put together and when these people and those other people have been talked to.<\/p> <p> Having talked to representatives of the forest industry, it is evident they have lost confidence.  That is the first aspect.  In addition, is it the Green dream that this is all going to be native woodland?  I see pine is included in this proposal.  I will not say in this House what I think of pine.  I have, however, seen pine trees growing around the country, and those trees should never have been sown because it is the worst timber anyone has ever put in.  Why has the wording here not referred to &ldquo;forestry&rdquo;?  That would allow people to sow whatever native species they wished.  People would then be able to sow pine, even though I would not be a great fan of it, or even a bit of spruce in a corner.<\/p> <p> I will give an example of what I have seen down the country.  Fields are generally square, and when farmers are mowing fields they go around in semicircles, leaving what we call shelter belts.  Those could be composed of different species.  I often saw spruce trees forming part of those belts and they never did a bit of harm.  I also often saw all-native timber stands and that never did a bit of harm.  It was a great idea.  Today, however, the Department has stated that anything less than 0.1 ha will not come up in the carbon counting.  It will, though, come up in the context of the Department's dashboard, when we are all told every week we are great now and we have reached 5,000 ha.<\/p> <p> The reality of afforestation in this country now is we are cutting 6 ha for every 1 ha we are planting.  The Government has not addressed that issue.  The reality is that approximately 45 licences were dealt with last month and 36 in the month before.  It is a disgrace what has happened to people who want to plant forestry in this country.  What is being done by the Government now is basically saying we are great because we have reached the 8,000 ha target for planting.  The question that must asked though is how we achieved it.  It was done by using every Tom, Dick and Harry of an excuse to try to tick the box and to cover Ireland's position down the road.  I have said this time and again.<\/p> <p> What the Minister&rsquo;s Department has done in the line of felling has worked, and that is good.  However, it is like a Mafia situation in that we have to keep bringing in people to keep going after the Department all the time to get results for the people out there who are busting their arses trying to get work in and living from forestry or to keep sawmills going.  I am referring not just to the situation now.  It is criminal what has gone on in that Department over the past six years.  It will be the farmers of Ireland who will be kicked under this new climate agreement.  That will happen in five, ten and 15 years' time because of what we have done now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500033#MM00300","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639578120,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for giving me time.  I appreciate what the Minister and Minister of State are trying to do here and I welcome the amendments, but this falls far short of what we really need.  There is a major crisis within the forestry sector.  The chair and the other members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine will agree with me on this point.  This is the one issue that has continually been discussed in that committee since the start of this D&aacute;il.  It is the one issue which has continued to be debated and discussed since then.  It is a sector that is always in a crisis mode and that will continue.<\/p>  <p>  What we require here is stand-alone legislation to fix the outstanding issues which exist.  We saw the support for the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 that came from right around the House.  The Minister will get the very same support if stand-alone legislation is brought in to fix the problems that now exist.  Having spoken to the nursery people, the planters, the sawmill operators and everybody involved, it is evident everyone recognises the problems that exist and they feel the Department is not getting to grips with the real issues and sorting them out.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to situations where people are trying to build houses, and I know this debate is concerned with the planting aspect, the felling of forestry is also a great problem.  There are millions of trees to be felled now while we have this ongoing issue with licensing.  Many people who have submitted applications to plant forestry, and many of those applications are still going through the process and being assessed, will never do this because they see the crisis in the sector.  It might be useful if the Minister looked at the people involved in this regard and spoke to them about their applications.  Senator Paul Daly spoke about this in the Upper House today, and I agree 100% with what he said.  If those applicants were telephoned today and asked whether they wanted to go ahead with their planting applications, yes or no, I assure the Minister it would then be possible to deal with and get through the applications of those who are serious and want to plant forestry.<\/p>  <p>  We could all speak here on forestry for the next three or four hours and about the issues in this sector.  They can be solved easily, however.  I plead with the Minister, the Minister of State, their officials and the Department to look at stand-alone legislation to deal with the real crisis existing in this sector now.  I assure the Minister and the Minister of State that support would be forthcoming from all around the House if such legislation were introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500034#NN00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639578120,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Appointment of Member and Chair of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Ombudsman Commission: Motion","time":1639578120,"counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500034#NN00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1639578120,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, noting that the Government on 7th December, 2021, nominated Judge Rory MacCabe for appointment by the President as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and as its chairperson, recommends, pursuant to section 65(1)<i>(b)<\/i>of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, that Judge Rory MacCabe be appointed by the President as a member and as chairperson of the Commission. <\/blockquote>  <p>The appointment of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, is governed by the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which requires the Government to be satisfied a person to be nominated for appointment has the appropriate experience, qualifications, training or expertise for appointment.  The Act also provides that a member of the ombudsman commission is appointed by the President following his or her nomination by the Government and the passage of resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas recommending his or her appointment.  In this regard, at its meeting on 7 December 2021, the Government nominated Judge Rory MacCabe.  I am pleased to recommend formally to the House that Members approve Judge MacCabe for appointment by the President to be a member and the chair of the ombudsman commission.<\/p><p>The need for this appointment arises from the expiry of the terms of office on 11 December of the former chair of the ombudsman commission, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring.  I express the Government's sincere appreciation of the contributions Ms Justice Ring has made to GSOC's important and complex work.  As chair of the ombudsman commission, Ms Justice Ring provided superb leadership and vision.  I wish her well in the future as she returns to her judicial duties in the High Court.<\/p><p>The Government decided in September to request the Attorney General to ask the Chief Justice to seek expressions of interest from serving and retired judges of the Superior Courts in the role.  A selection committee was formed to review the applications.  The selection committee comprised Mr. Garrett Sheehan, who was the chair, Ms Marie Cross, formerly of Department of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Paul Gallagher, our Attorney General.  As there were no successful applications, the selection committee then subsequently accepted expressions of interest from judges of the District and Circuit Courts.  Judge MacCabe was recommended as an excellent candidate.<\/p> <p>In accordance with section 66(1) of the Act, a member of the ombudsman commission holds office for a period exceeding three years but not exceeding six years.  The Government has agreed that Judge MacCabe would be appointed to the ombudsman commission for the minimum period provided for under the Act of three years or such shorter term as may result from the enactment of legislation providing for the restructuring of the ombudsman commission; namely, the forthcoming policing, security and community safety Bill.<\/p> <p> In addition, in light of the significance of the role and the recent precedent, approval was also sought and granted by the Government to nominate Judge MacCabe to the High Court.  Section 65(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, provides that a person who holds judicial office in a superior court may, without relinquishing that office, be appointed as the chairperson of the commission, but unless otherwise provided for in the terms of the appointment they shall not be required to carry out duties under statute as the holder of that judicial office.  Section 65(6) gives effect to Schedule 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, which provides that if an ordinary judge of the High Court is appointed to GSOC the number of High Court judges otherwise provided for under enactment may be exceeded by one.<\/p> <p> GSOC has played, and will continue to play, a critical role in the overall architecture of policing in this State.  Its independence is the guarantee to the public that complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be investigated without fear or favour.  Its three key operational principles of inquiry, independence and impartiality are the hallmarks of a policing oversight organisation of which we can be justifiably proud and which is vital in an advanced democracy such as we are fortunate to inhabit.<\/p> <p> Judge MacCabe is currently a sitting Circuit Court judge.  He was appointed to the Circuit Court in 2007 and for the last ten years he has been serving on the western circuit where the work is almost exclusively indictable crime.  He was admitted to the inner Bar in 1999; prior to that he worked as a civil servant in a variety of important roles, mainly in the Department of the Taoiseach.  During his time as a senior counsel he was a member of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  He has also served on the board of the Courts Service.  Judge MacCabe's very considerable experience as a practitioner, as a judge in criminal law, and of criminal trials and the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be of great benefit to the complex and challenging work of the ombudsman commission.<\/p> <p> This appointment will provide for authoritative and independent leadership of an important organisation while it prepares to transition to a new organisational structure under the policing, security and community safety Bill.  This is a time of change for GSOC, and Judge MacCabe will now lead that change along with the other commissioners, Hugh Hume and Emily Logan, and with the management and staff of GSOC.  I am sure the House will agree it is vital that the public has deep confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its system of oversight, of which the ombudsman commission is a key component.  I believe that the considerable skills and experience of Judge MacCabe will serve to enhance the public's existing confidence in GSOC's role.<\/p> <p> Subject to the agreement of both Houses, I intend to make arrangements for the President to appoint Judge MacCabe as soon as practicable.  On behalf of the Government, I am pleased to commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500034#NN00500","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639578720,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Carthy.  We have no issue with this new appointment.  I wish Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, the outgoing chair, all the best for her future on her retirement from the role.  I met her on a number of occasions and she was certainly diligent in trying to do the right thing and progress things.  She felt handicapped on many occasions, particularly in regard to funding and resources to be able to do the job to the level she and many within the organisation wanted to do.<\/p>  <p>  GSOC has a vital role to play in building public confidence in regard to difficulties that people encounter when engaging with certain members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The State as a whole and all of us have a job to do to build the maximum amount of public confidence in the institutions of the State.  I refer to recent issues with people who tend to be anti-vax and against everything and who slide into that very right-wing thinking.  A lot of that is based on mistrust of the institutions of the State and the way they carry out their duties.  The mistrust and difficulty people often have with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feeds into that.  GSOC has a crucial role to play.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister mentioned, changes are going to occur and there are moves to transition the organisation, to put some sense of order into it and to overhaul investigation procedures, give it more powers and its own budget.  All of those changes are welcome and are moving in the right direction.  The general consensus among those who contact my office and the offices of other Deputies is that when people make complaints to GSOC, they find it frustrating that they do not get the kind of response they expect or the level of attention to detail that they would hope to get.  One of the problems is in regard to staffing.  Having members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out investigations into members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not the right way to conduct this.  It needs not just to be independent but to be seen to be independent.  That has been one of its key failings.<\/p>  <p>  I could go through a whole list of cases where people have had problems and have felt extremely frustrated with all of that.  Many Deputies have raised high-profile cases where people felt let down.  They thought GSOC was going to follow through on things but it did not.  Oftentimes reasons were used such as that the particular garda&iacute; involved had retired.  Once they are retired that is it, they close the file and it is all over.  Certainly for people who are looking for justice and to progress something, that is not a solution.  It only frustrates them and makes it worse.  There needs to be a great deal of work done.<\/p>  <p>  I wish Judge MacCabe all the best in trying to progress this.  He certainly has a job of work to do.  I do not know the man at all but I take it on merit that he has the level of experience and good judgment in respect of how to follow through in this situation.  We all have to reflect on things that have happened in the past with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with GSOC.  The Maurice McCabe situation is probably the big high-profile case that really shocked the public.  It did an awful lot to rock people's confidence in how things were done in this country.  GSOC has a job of work to do to restore that confidence.  This new appointment will hopefully be the start of moving that forward.<\/p>  <p>  The independence of the office needs to be reinforced more than anything else.  While there are approximately 130 full-time staff there at present, many of them are former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other police services.  That may be the only place they can go to find people with adequate experience or qualifications but at the same time it does reflect poorly on the whole area of independence and how we can establish that better.<\/p>  <p>  The job of work that is going to be needed to transform GSOC is only part of this.  It is also necessary to transform how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is managed.  I recognise and appreciate the work the Minister has done since she came into office to bring about legislative change to make that happen.  We have such a distance to go that we need to be all working together.  This appointment is welcome.  A fresh pair of hands will be in charge.  The policing, security and community safety Bill will open that up better and give more powers.  Hopefully Judge MacCabe will be able to take that on and drive it forward.  It is certainly what we need to see happen as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Minister and everyone here a happy Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500035#OO00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1639578720,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I have not had an opportunity to formally welcome the Minister back.  I congratulate her on her recent arrival.  GSOC should be the route whereby families or victims who feel they have been ill served by Garda actions can find truth and justice.  One family that sought this were the parents and siblings of Shane O'Farrell.  This House will recall that Shane was a 23-year-old Carrickmacross man killed in a hit-and-run on 2 August 2011 by a known criminal who had breached several bail conditions at the time and who had 42 previous convictions in three different jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>Rather than GSOC providing truth and justice to Shane's family, it compounded their grief.  In April 2014 the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter, ordered a section 102(5) public interest inquiry that allowed GSOC to widen the scope of its inquiry, but it failed to do so.  In April 2018 GSOC produced the section 101 public interest report, but the family and public received only a summarised version.  The O'Farrell family has written to GSOC on several occasions requesting the full report but it has been refused.<\/p> <p> In January 2019 GSOC produced a second report under section 97 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  This was given to the Garda Commissioner but not to the family.  Both the Garda Commissioner and GSOC refused to give the family the report.  Rather than being a route for justice, the GSOC investigation was used as a ruse by Ministers, the Department and the Garda to shelve movement on this case for several years and to refuse to answer any questions, on the basis that the matter was being investigated by GSOC.  The GSOC report, when finally published, was significant primarily because of its omissions, so much so that both Houses of the Oireachtas passed resolutions calling for an independent public inquiry into the case.  Rather than delivering that, the Government initiated a scoping inquiry in early 2019, an inquiry that has, bizarrely, yet to deliver its report.  It is entirely understandable, therefore, that this has led to fear that the scoping exercise is just another mechanism to delay the revealing of the full truth in this instance.<\/p> <p> The GSOC process has failed some families, such as the family of Shane O'Farrell.  It needs to be overhauled, bearing in mind the experiences and lessons relayed to us.  I plead with the Minister to reassure the O'Farrell family, as they approach their 11th Christmas without their beloved son Shane, that she will deliver upon the resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and begin now the preparatory work for the full public inquiry that we hope will provide the answers to the endless list of unsavoury questions that have been raised regarding this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500035#OO00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639579320,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this matter.  The vast bulk of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whom we are very fortunate to have, have been the line of defence of our State over several turbulent decades, but there have been several issues.  There will always be issues that require an investigation independent of the police because society and the Oireachtas provide extraordinary powers to those we make guardians of the peace.  We give powers to arrest, detain, prosecute and so on.  We must have proper oversight of these.<\/p>  <p>  Issues have arisen over the decades.  Since the Morris tribunal, I have been advocating the examination of international best practice to ascertain how we can deal with the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reassure Members and the public that everything is being done properly and appropriately.  I argued for a very long time about the model we should have.  The model existed in Northern Ireland with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  I had long discussions with former ombudsman Nuala O'Loan, who came to Dublin and spoke to a variety of groups here about her experiences in Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government, after a lot of urging, decided to have a commission rather than an arrangement modelled on that in Northern Ireland.  We are going to adjust that now in the new legislation that is coming before us.  We are going to have an ombudsman and a deputy ombudsman.  We will debate this in due course.  It is a big advance.<\/p>  <p>  We can genuinely say, for a variety of reasons, that our experience with GSOC has not been uniformly what we expected or desired.  GSOC itself will state many of the reasons for that.  I hope that, in the new legislation to be enacted, we can address those.  I very much welcome the specifics of what is included in the forthcoming policing, security and community safety Bill, the general scheme of which was published in April of this year, to expand the remit of the Garda ombudsman to cover allegations that come to light other than by way of complaint from the public.  In this regard, I am referring to its investigation procedure and the need to support the really important, timely and effective resolution of complaints.  To put it bluntly, complaints have not been resolved in this way.  I felt that, once GSOC was in place, we had a robust body to address the kinds of complaints we got over the years regarding the activities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, there is an old adage that justice delayed is justice denied.  Addressing complaints must not go on for years.  Deputy Carthy is right regarding the case he has brought.  I have met the family in question over the years.  They always seem to be seven steps away from getting at the truth.  That must not be.  Ours is not an enormous society so we can surely provide mechanisms to do what is required properly.  I look forward to debating the specifics of the legislation and to having what I hope will be a really effective oversight body.<\/p>  <p>  We need to give the new form of GSOC additional powers.  The Garda looks for the powers for itself but those who are to hold it to account need, at least, powers at the same level.  I do not know Judge Rory MacCabe.  I wish him well.  His CV looks very impressive.  It is a cause of interest, at least, that the original underlying legislation envisaged that the chairperson of GSOC would be a member of the superior courts.  Nobody came through the associated process.  Was it that nobody in the superior courts wanted the position?  A little bit of investigation is required.  Maybe the Minister has already done so privately to determine why it was the case.  I am sure Judge MacCabe, who is now going to be made a member of the High Court, will operate admirably.  I thank, and appreciate the work of, the outgoing chairperson, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, whom I believe did a sterling job in the circumstances.  I wish her well on her return to the Bench.<\/p>  <p>  The oversight of policing is a pivotal issue for our democracy.  We need to get it right.  We will have a broader opportunity, when we debate the forthcoming legislation, to get it right.  As a House of democratic accountability, we must ensure enduring oversight so people can have absolute confidence in policing and the way the laws are enforced in this country and so some of the dreadful anomalies that have arisen in the past couple of decades will not recur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500036#PP00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1639579320,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The debate is about the appointment of the new chairperson of GSOC.  Like Deputy Howlin, I do not know Judge Rory MacCabe but wish him well in his new role.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot of work to be done to realise the full potential of GSOC.  Indeed, we will be talking about some changes in the new year.  GSOC was not resourced properly from the get-go.  We repeatedly hear that.  GSOC does not have the resources to investigate all the complaints it receives and to do so in a timely way.  That has repeatedly been brought to our attention.<\/p>  <p>  GSOC receives around 2,000 complaints per year, involving some 5,000 allegations predominantly related to the abuse of authority, assault, neglect of duty and discourtesy.  Despite the original intention to form an independent ombudsman for the Garda, not all GSOC investigations are independent.  Aside from those that relate to some kind of criminal allegation, large numbers of complaints are passed back to the Garda.  In fact, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland revealed that many people believed GSOC was part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is quite sobering that this is the understanding of the public, or a large number of members of the public.  Given that in 2020, 42% of the GSOC allegations about the Garda were conducted by garda&iacute;, this belief is closer to the truth than many of us would like.<\/p>  <p>  In many cases, the Garda is investigating serious complaints against itself.  It is completely unsatisfactory to the complainants and also harms the integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When GSOC was being set up in the first instance, there was a very hot public debate and considerable resistance to setting up any kind of independent body to investigate the Garda.  <\/p> <p>It is for the good of both the public and the Garda that there should be that oversight.  A system of reform and accountability will help rather than hinder a police force.  None of this is to say the Garda should not play a role in dealing with complaints.  Of course they should.  Some of the complaints come from almost a customer service point of view, with garda&iacute; deemed to have been impolite.  Of course that is the kind of thing that must go back to the Garda.  One of the most common complaints about GSOC is the length of time it takes to complete investigations.  Obviously, that has an effect on the complainants, who have their cases dragged out for long periods, but it also negatively impacts those who are under investigation on the other side, so it is unsatisfactory to both sides for that to be the case.<\/p> <p> GSOC has repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of Garda co-operation with investigations.  The outgoing chair of GSOC, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, stated that the body had no teeth to act when there was no Garda co-operation or when the Garda was slow to provide GSOC with information.  In GSOC's 2020 report it complained of being left in the dark by Garda management.  The under-resourcing and slowdown of compliance with investigations hurts everyone.  It has got worse recently because of what could only be described as an unofficial strike or, if you like, a work to rule on the part of the Association of Garda Chief Superintendents and the Association of Garda Superintendents since 5 July.  Their members have decided to undertake core duties only.  They have deemed GSOC investigations to be outside of their core duties.  I have to disagree with them because I believe that upholding the integrity of the Garda is a fundamental core duty of theirs.  I remember their attitude when the blue flu issue arose.  This is the issue in converse and it has to be dealt with.  That this has gone on since last July has to be a major cause for concern.  It needs to be resolved quickly.<\/p> <p> In the few minutes left, I wish to share some of the concerns that have been raised about the case of Shane O'Farrell.  Having met the family, specifically Lucia O'Farrell, I found her to be a really impressive individual.  She had conducted forensic examinations and produced documentation that had done the heavy lifting and the work that was needed.  It feels like this is bouncing around the place as a delaying tactic.  It certainly feels like that to me.  I think we are all very frustrated by the length of time that this is taking, given the time that has elapsed and the amount of work that has been done, much of it by the family.  A very impressive body of documents has been presented.<\/p> <p> I wish Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring well for the future and thank her for the work she has done to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500036#PP00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639579920,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I know nothing about the new appointee, Judge MacCabe, but I think his role should be challenged, not just in respect of what happens in the future but also in how he deals with the legacy of GSOC.  The first complainant to GSOC - I cannot remember the year - was Deputy Gino Kenny.  He was not a Deputy then.  We had RT&Eacute; footage of him being thrown off a bridge in Bellanaboy by six garda&iacute;, illegally and violently, at a Shell to Sea protest.  I queued up with him that morning and his complaint was thrown out, investigated by garda&iacute; themselves.  The Minister said GSOC's independence \"is the guarantee to the public that complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be investigated without fear or favour\".  There is no guarantee.  As previous speakers have pointed out, a high percentage of the public do not see GSOC as independent and investigating without fear or favour.<\/p>  <p>  The case of Shane O'Farrell has been mentioned.  I have spoken to Lucia within the past hour and told her that, sadly, somebody she wanted to meet, namely Terence Wheelock's father, passed away last week without ever knowing how his son died in custody in Store Street Garda station.  The Wheelock family have re-engaged in a campaign for a public inquiry into that young man's death.<\/p>  <p>  It has been almost a year since George Nkencho was killed by armed garda&iacute; in Blanchardstown and we do not know where that will lead or how long the investigation will take.  There is therefore a litany of reasons the public are not confident in GSOC.  Whatever difference the judge whom the Minister has appointed will make will be most welcome, but there are legacy issues that have to be dealt with.  If we do not deal with them, we will just be battening down on the mistrust and the lack of confidence Joe Public has in An Garda and all the apparatus surrounding it.  The new chairperson of GSOC may bring with him considerable skills and experience, but he has to ensure that whatever happened in the past is dealt with.  To that end, the three specific cases of Shane O'Farrell, Terence Wheelock and George Nkencho, although still at coroner's report stage, must be speedily dealt with and not dragged out longer and longer like Stardust and Bloody Sunday were and like all those very deeply felt injustices are dragged out by the State apparatus.<\/p>  <p>  No senior garda&iacute; are ever really held accountable for what happens on their watch.  We do not see that come in front of us with reports that such-and-such a senior garda is being suspended or taken off duties or is up on charges for what has happened.  We have to begin to see results.  The proof has to be in the pudding and the results have to be seen.  Otherwise, there will be failure after failure and the public will never have confidence in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500037#QQ00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1639579920,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I wish to use this opportunity to make a broader point about the make-up of GSOC.  It is not representative of communities that are badly policed or over-policed.  Where are the young people, the people of colour, the members of the Travelling community or the trade unionists?  Where is the diversity and the diverse experience?  I cast no personal aspersions, but this deficit will self-evidently not be addressed by appointing an older white male from a middle-class profession.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest issue on GSOC's plate is the George Nkencho case.  George was the first black person to be killed by the police in the history of this State.  The investigation is being carefully watched not just locally and nationally but internationally.  It is not an exaggeration to say that GSOC's standing will, in large measure, be determined by the outcome of the case.  I wish to voice my strong disappointment at the fact that, having set a deadline to finish the investigation by the 30 December anniversary of George's killing, GSOC last week told the family that that deadline will now not be met.  There are worrying indications that important details of the investigation are not being progressed.  There are also worrying signs that the level of co-operation and transparency that might have been expected by the Nkencho family and people of colour in this country generally is not being met.  Judge Rory MacCabe will have important issues on his plate when he takes up this post and I and many others will be watching very carefully how those issues are handled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500037#QQ00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1639579920,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and thank the Minister for bringing it before the House.  I have just three points to make in the time allowed.<\/p>  <p>  First, I very much welcome the appointment of Judge Rory MacCabe to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Having reviewed his CV, I think he is eminently suitable for the role.  Not only is he suitable as an individual, but also, collectively, it makes sense to appoint him to GSOC.  There is a fair amount of diversity of backgrounds and skill sets in GSOC now.  There is Emily Logan, with a background in management, human rights and children's rights, and Hugh Hume, with a background in policing outside this jurisdiction.  To add a member of the legal profession would make perfect sense.  There is a good skill set and good balance.  The Minister might comment in her closing remarks, though, as to whether GSOC is limited to three commissioners only or whether it would be possible to appoint an additional commissioner if required, taking in some of the points other Deputies have made.<\/p> <p>The second point I would like to make concerns Judge MacCabe and GSOC.  The important functions are accountability, oversight and balance.  GSOC must been seen to be promoting good policing but also taking issue with poor policing.  The vast majority of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are competent and capable.  We have seen that throughout the Covid pandemic over the past number of years.  Any interactions that I have had with GSOC have been very positive and professional.  In general terms, I think it gets the balance right.  <\/p> <p> I wish to make a point regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a human organisation, just like the parliamentary community here in Leinster House.  By extension, any human organisation is imperfect.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an imperfect organisation.  It is aware of that and it would be the first to admit it.  However, it must be doing something right, because if a Government closes down a Garda station in rural Ireland, it will get an earful and people will not allow that to happen.  People want more garda&iacute;, Garda stations and Garda cars.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be doing something right, and it is.  Indeed, 99% of the garda do an exceptional job and they should be supported.  However, it is important that GSOC is also there to provide oversight and the public accountability when things go wrong.<\/p> <p> Finally, on another metric that does matter, the roll of honour of the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been killed in the line of duty since the foundation of the State, the centenary of which is next year, shows the level of commitment from 99% of the garda&iacute; out there.  It is important that they are supported.  In summary,  I would like to wish Judge MacCabe and the new commissioners well in their new roles.  I wish Ms Justice Ring well in her new role and thank her for her service and contribution to the country over the past three years.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether it is possible to appoint a fourth commissioner to focus on some of the points mentioned here today.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500037#QQ00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639580520,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I wish Judge Rory MacCabe the best of luck in his new role.  I do not know him personally, but I knew him in a former life in a professional capacity.  I also want to compliment Ms Justice Ring on her work over the past six years.  She posed a question to us in a recent interview.  She questioned whether politicians &quot;are actually committed to meaningful independent oversight of the garda&iacute;&quot;.  That should spur us all on to reflect on whether we are.  If we are, how have we allowed GSOC to exist without adequate resources and without listening to it year after year?  The latest GSOC report is the fifteenth it has published.  The Government received the report on time but delayed publishing it.<\/p><p>When the appointments of Ms Emily Logan and Mr. Hugh Hume were being approved by the D&aacute;il, if that is the correct word to use, and we discussed the issue, Ms Justice Ring took the opportunity to send a detailed letter not to all Deputies, but to those who contributed to the debate.  She set out clearly, honestly and openly the problems and the obstacles posed by the founding legislation, which put up so many hurdles that it is almost impossible to negotiate, with investigations being sent back to the Garda so they can investigate themselves.  With regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, she stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tThere is a misconception that GSOC has a significant number of former Garda members as part of its investigative staff.  There are five former Garda members, all of whom joined at the outset in 2007 and 2008 and thus have been involved in oversight for the last 13 years.  There have been no former Garda personnel employed by GSOC since that initial set-up period.  <\/blockquote>  <p>She told us that training was a problem and was not built into the legislation.  No provision was made for it and there were no resources to acknowledge it, as well as many other defects.  I am using the word &quot;defects&quot;; Ms Justice Ring did not.  She highlighted the good and the bad.<\/p><p>We have ignored that.  Successive Governments have simply ignored that.  During Ms Justice Ring's time on GSOC for the past six years, she sent three letters - one to Deputies and two to the Committee of Public Accounts - highlighting in an open and consistent way what was needed if politicians were seriously interested in an independent ombudsman's office.  That is the challenge.  Clearly, we are not, because we are colluding with a system that is inadequate.<\/p><p>Related to that is the attitude of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The fact that the Garda Commissioner and the other organisations representing members of the Garda, sergeants and so on expressed serious reservations about the proposed Bill because of the further oversight of the Garda is of a serious matter of concern when I reflect on the circumstances that led to the establishment of GSOC, the Policing Authority and the other body, the name of which escapes me.  I call them the trinity of supervision.  Looking back, we think of the 1970s and the &quot;Heavy Gang&quot;.  In the 1980s, we remember the case of Joanne Hayes and what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was capable of there.  When we were supposedly investigating the behaviour of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we investigated the morality of Joanne Hayes and her family.  We can then fast forward to the Morris tribunal, which Deputy Howlin and former Deputy, Jim Higgins, played a very important role in setting up.  The cost to the taxpayer is &euro;70 million now.  Foolishly, each Government decided that there was only a problem in County Donegal, and they are a bit different up there.  We did not learn that maybe it was a practice that was going on everywhere.  Later, we had the Smithwick tribunal on collusion, the Fennelly commission and the O'Higgins commission of investigation, which was my introduction to the D&aacute;il in early 2016.  I read the whole report.  It was produced very speedily within a year.  However, had Sergeant McCabe not kept a phone recording, God knows what might have happened to him.  We have had all of that and many more besides.  There are ongoing investigations into members of the Garda who have been suspended, the debacle over the fixed penalty points and the bogus breath testing and so on.  Yet, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na thinks it does not need oversight.  I am not referring to ordinary members of the Garda; I pay tribute to the ordinary garda on the ground.  We know from the Policing Authority reports that are published month after month the wonderful role they have played on the ground.  There was a break but they have come back.  However, management needs to realise that garda&iacute; are there to serve.  Indeed, the Policing Authority and its chairman, Bob Collins, has brought that concept into focus.  We are not talking about a police force, but a police service.  Like Deputies are here to serve, the police are here to serve.  They should be proud to have an independent oversight body.  We should ensure that it functions independently and is adequately resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500038#RR00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1639580520,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and their good wishes for Judge MacCabe.  I wish to touch on a number of points that have been raised.  We all recognise the vital role that GSOC plays in oversight.  We all acknowledge that the vast majority of people working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do exceptional work in protecting us and keeping our communities safe.  The vast majority of people believe that as well.  We have seen just how connected members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are with our communities, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We support that, but obviously, nobody is perfect.  We know that there has to be a level of independent oversight.  Of course, we need to make sure that GSOC is properly resourced.  That is a priority for this Government.  I will put a few figures on the record of the House.  Despite a 20% increase in complaints that were received during the first three quarters of this year, compared to last year, plus a 10% year-on-year increase in criminal investigations, GSOC has broadly met its commitments and timeframes in responding to queries and issues that have come to it.  The latest figures indicate that as of October, all complaints that were received by GSOC were responded to in a day.  All calls that were made were answered within 60 seconds.  I know that not all of the calls were responded to in the time that we would like, but often, we only hear about where there are problems, not where a lot of these complaints are dealt within in the timeframe necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We need to continue to increase the budget.  Looking at this year alone, &euro;11.27 million was provided.  Next year, it will be &euro;13.4 million, which is an increase of almost 20%.  Of course, we will continue to provide more resources where they are required.  There is provision for three commissioners, but, as Deputy Howlin mentioned, we are bringing forward a community safety and policing Bill to the House.  There is a very clear direction for GSOC in overhauling the investigation procedures to support timely and effective resolution of complaints, expanding the remit of GSOC and replacing the current three-person commission with an ombudsman and deputy ombudsman, reinforcing its independence.  Training was mentioned.  I am of the firm belief that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should always receive continuous ongoing training.  That should be no different for GSOC and those who are tasked with the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is something that we would like to see as part of the overall legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies mentioned the Shane O'Farrell case.  I appreciate that the scoping inquiry is going on much longer than anybody would like and, in particular, his family.<\/p> <p>I will outline where we are at present.  While this is an independent scoping exercise, we are in constant contact with Judge Gerard Haughton.  We have offered any support he needs while allowing him to do his work independently.  The stage it is at now is that the judge has asked for various sections of the reporting parties named, including the Department, to come back to the latest round of questions he has asked.  The Department has responded to him.  That request has been sent back.  I understand he has been in contact with the O'Farrell family throughout all of this and has offered them the same opportunity to come back on some of what I hope are the final points.  Based on the information I have been given, he should be in a position to finalise his report once he has the final pieces of information on the particular points.<\/p> <p> I know I am being vague but I do not have sight of the points on which he is asking questions and the type of responses he is seeking.  It is my understanding that once he receives all of these he will be in a position to respond.  I reassure Deputies that nobody is stalling.  I really want to see this concluded as quickly as possible so we can act on whatever recommendations and points are made in the report.  What is most important is that his family can take account of it and we can move forward in some way together.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their support for this recent appointment.  I hear all of the points that have been made with regard to making sure GSOC is independent and has the support its needs and that it can do its work effectively.  We are committed to this.  I look forward to engaging with Deputies in the year ahead on any restructuring or change.  I know we will have lots to discuss in the year ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500038#RR00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639581120,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Appropriation Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1639581120,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500039#SS00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639581120,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639581120,"counter":201,"content":"<p>In my contribution last night I touched on the carryover into 2022 of an unspent &euro;800 million.  I also highlighted many issues in Waterford.  Although I wanted to keep the observations to a national context I am afraid the announcements overnight force me to do otherwise.  The Department of Transport's support package of &euro;108 million to regional aviation bypasses Waterford Airport yet again.  Not alone do we not get any money out of the total &euro;160 million package but the Department withdrew &euro;350,000 in stopgap funding while we were waiting the development of a new runway, subject to An Bord Plean&aacute;la permission.  The funding was withdrawn despite Waterford Airport being the busiest private flying airport in the country, despite it seeing significant expansion and the recent announcement of the Atlantic Flight Training Academy, and despite that a planning application was pending with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Two weeks ago, at the transport committee I asked a principal officer for a response on why Waterford was being excluded.  I am still waiting on that.  Is Cork the preferred location for a future Rescue 117 contract?  It appears to be what this policy is stating.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to our hospital services, I have highlighted to the Minister and colleagues the failure of the South\/South West Hospital \/Group to expedite the appointment of 24 whole-time equivalents to cardiology to expand the hours.  We are still at 39 hours per week.  It is the most underfunded model 4 hospital, with the third longest waiting list, in the country.  There are 1,000 fewer whole-time equivalents than in Limerick and 2,000 fewer than in Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Waterford Institute of Technology is still waiting for an announcement on the capital funding the Minister has in mind despite it being announced for its equivalents in Dublin and Cork two years prior to their designation.  It has been confirmed that the college cannot borrow from the European Investment Bank to support student teaching spaces and only student accommodation.  In the meantime, an engineering block promised since 2012 looks like it will not be delivered before 2025 or 2026.<\/p>  <p>  It is hard to understand all of this in the context of the programme for Government citing Waterford as a centre for expansion in the south east.  I refer to Deputy Ring's speech in recent days.  How does a public servant get sacked in this country?  Everybody in the Government tells me they are trying to initiate policy to support Waterford in the south east.  I can only conclude it is being held up within the Department.  If we are going to issue new Covid certificates perhaps we should develop a new national certificate for people from the south east so we can clearly delineate them from the rest of the population and discriminate them as we are with regard to funding in the region.<\/p>  <p>  If developing Waterford and the south east is a significant part of the programme ,why do we suffer procedural delays that do not attach to any other capital project?  Why do we suffer endless financial reviews and project reviews while others skate on unhindered?  I could certainly point to where the &euro;800 million could be spent in the most underfunded region in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500039#SS00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1639581120,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will fully support the Bill.  It is an essential element of the financial housekeeping that must be concluded by the Oireachtas within the calendar year.  The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure undertaken in 2021 on the basis of the Estimates voted through by the D&aacute;il during the year.  The passage of the Bill will also ensure payments funded from voted expenditure in 2021, such as the housing assistance payment, jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance and the non-contributory State pension.  We also have nurses' pay, teachers' pay and all of the other pay and pension funded from voted money that can continue to be funded throughout 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I will use the remainder of my time to reference some of the outliers that remain.  The past 18 months have recalibrated how we see front-line workers.  Now the person working in the supermarket is seen very much in an heroic aspect.  Prior to the pandemic perhaps we would have considered their role quite apart from someone in the fire service or the Garda.  They have been very much on the front line throughout the pandemic.  It is the same for teachers and those in the early childcare sector.  Many people have been cogs in a massive wheel keeping our country functioning during a time of crisis.<\/p>  <p>  As we negotiate our way through Covid, pass the Bill and look at maintaining pay levels for our public servants, there are a few issues we need to examine.  We had a good announcement recently by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that fourth year student nurses are to receive a 12.5% pay increase for their hospital placement.  This is good and right.  They are falling into line and helping us through a crisis period.  There is also the two-tier pay system in the teaching profession for entrants to the profession after 2011.  On average, they earn &euro;4,000 less per annum than colleagues who entered prior to 2011.  I was a teacher until the general election.  It was wrong that the teacher across the corridor from me was earning on average &euro;4,000 less per annum.  Cumulatively across her career if this is not rectified there will be a discrepancy of income of approximately &euro;100,000.<\/p> <p>That is wrong, given that we are doing the same job and lifting the same load every day.  I know talks are under way to advance this but it needs to be a major priority to wrap up all of that in 2022.  <\/p> <p> The same applies to the early childcare sector where talks are ongoing and there is positivity, I believe, in that regard.  This is also something we need to look at because I spent a number of years in Mary Immaculate College training to be teacher.  The lecture hall beside me had people doing early childhood studies.  There were so much overlap in the training modules that we are doing that we just ended up going down different career paths, that is, primary school teaching versus the early childhood sector.  What we take home in pay cheques, that is, teachers versus those in cr&egrave;ches and preschools, is incomparable.  Once and for all, we need to acknowledge the highly skilled and valued work of people in the early years sector.  I know that efforts are being made by Government, but in 2022 when we all make new year resolutions, this should be the year that we look at those who fell into the front line, who kept as buoyant and who kept the country upright during the Covid-19 pandemic, and do the right thing by their salary and pay conditions.<\/p> <p> Overall, the Bill will not be the most exciting business to go through the D&aacute;il this week but it is necessary.  It is functional and will allow all of the payment streams from Government to continue without too much kerfuffle and for that reason I imagine it will pass here without too much debate or dissent.

This legislation represents necessary housekeeping that has been identified and it is a constitutional requirement that relates to the mandate and powers to ensure that money is expended.  As a general point, this pandemic has taught us about public spending and the role of the State and that, contrary to some of its critics, it is capable of being agile, responsive and innovative when required and when the political will is there.  That is not to say that all public expenditure can be clumsy and careless but it does provide a response to some of the critics who believe that the State is inefficient.  The pandemic has proven that that is not the case and that the role of the State is crucial.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise a number of areas of expenditure, some of which are areas the Minister will be sympathetic to and will potentially have been working on himself.  It is important, nonetheless, to give them an airing.  He will be aware, when it comes to capital expenditure, of the plight Cork Educate Together Secondary School finds itself in.  We were both there when it was officially announced in 2016.  The position in that school has been continuing since then.  I do not need to fill the Minister in with the details as if it had been another Minister I might have needed to do so.  We have a situation where the Department is spending &euro;80,000 to &euro;90,000 a year on school transport to take students from the south side to the other side of the city.  It is very frustrating for the school, in that only half a class can do art, they have to go to Collins&rsquo; Barracks for physical education, PE, or to the Glen Resource Centre as the school has no PE facilities itself.  There is a great deal of time lost in education because of the time spent travelling.  It is vitally important as I know that this is not just about funding.  Some of this is about the State&rsquo;s ability to plan ahead, identify where there is going to be population growth, have the work done in advance to know where a school will need to be built and to have that part of development done.  I urge the Minister to continue working with the Minister for Education to have this delivered as soon as possible and to bring that nightmare to an end.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;13.7 million additional funding for Cork Airport.  On funding for aviation, we need to be aware that the recovery is not going to happen over a year or two but potentially over three or four.  Although these undertakings will also need to carry their own water, additional supports will be needed from the State for three to four years to enable all our airports to recover.  Cork Airport is crucial to our own region.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise briefly in the last few seconds I have left the issue that was raised this morning regarding the assessments of need of 4,000 children.  It has a great impact, not only on their quality of life but on their ability to reach their full potential.  This has been dragging on for far too long.  There have been so many false dawns in how we address this.  It urgently needs to addressed because many children are losing out and their potential is being undermined by their failure to get the assessment of needs and the services that are necessary to follow it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500040#TT00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1639581720,"counter":206,"content":"<p>The Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2021 based on the Estimates that have been voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  The moneys that have been voted on are brought forward and made into law.  I am sure that there are many wish lists at the end of year for all parties concerned.  Housing, certainly is one for the first-time buyers, the trader-uppers and the downsizers, and social housing and the homeless are paramount for the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Another wish list would be for accountability in the health system.  Ursula von der Leyen earns &euro;351,000 per annum and answers to 447 million people.  Paul Reid earns &euro;426,000 per annum and answers to 5 million people.  He oversees a broken health system that has not improved over the past 12 months.  University Hospital Limerick. UHL, has topped the poll in eight weeks out of ten for overcrowding.  How many intensive care unit, ICU, beds have been created through this time?  When are the waiting lists going to be dealt with?  When is the trolley crisis going to be dealt with?  Where is the value for money?  As I have continually said there are loads of rules and regulations but nothing is enforced or there is no accountability. <\/p>  <p> Research has proven that the problem is not the increase in the attendance at emergency departments; it is the bottleneck in the flow of patients to the rest of the hospital system from the emergency departments.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe the Minister is a good one.  I have been self-employed from a very early age.  If I ran my business the way the health system is run by some of the people there I would have been out of business.  I was accountable for my business and to my family that my business would work, and I was accountable to the people who I employed.  They did the same for me.  I am thankful that I have the same people with me at all times and I treat them like family.  We are family because we support each other.  I hate that in my county of Limerick I see our hospital being top of a poll for overcrowding eight weeks out of ten.  On my first day in the D&aacute;il, I asked for a business model for hospitals and for a bed structure to be put in place and to go back in time to when the rounds were being done.  Beds were being released at 11 o&rsquo;clock after rounds.  It then gave the opportunity for beds to be cleaned and put back into the system by 1 p.m. and it created a flow of people but it also gave infrastructure for nurses and doctors within the hospitals.  They knew what beds they had and on what time they would have them.  It gave a structure.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked for an audit system on the hospitals.  Some of the public hospitals are working very well and others are not and I need help to sort this out.  The Government has thrown money time and again at this and has created massive buildings with similar technology and it has not fixed the problem.  This is a management problem.  Management needs to be held accountable for this situation.  <\/p>  <p>  I will move on to something that I have spoken to the Minister about, which is looking to the future to make provision for people working then.  I brought this up with him in connection with the wage subsidy system that is unfolding at the moment.  I said to him that 11,000 people will be affected by not qualifying for the scheme because the restrictions that were put in place are at 71% or 72% of their turnover in 2019, which means they will not qualify for the scheme on 1 January as one has to qualify by 31 December.  If we take the hotel industry, it has lost &euro;250 million of bookings because of Government Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p> <p>Businesses have lost bookings for November and December that they needed to carry them through January and February, when they do not have bookings, to be ready for March and the tourist season.  They have not lost only two months; they have lost four months.  The hospitality sector has invested in outside dining for customers to meet guidelines but it has been hit twice by new guidelines.  This is the second Christmas this has happened.  Does the Minister know any other business that could survive losing its Christmas trade two years in a row?<\/p> <p> Yes, the Government did help.  The employment wage subsidy scheme was the best thing it has done.  However, 18% of the hotel industry, with 11,000 people, will not qualify now for a wage subsidy.  The Minister may say they can qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, but the problem is it is very difficult to get people who were in receipt of the PUP back into the industry in which they were working.  To me, it is the same figure that can be made accountable for this.  I read a news headline just before I came into the Chamber.  An Irish company that delivers Mercedes-Benz vehicles into this country got &euro;108 million in wage subsidies.  It will cost &euro;7.5 million to protect 11,000 jobs in the hotel industry, not to mention the hotels themselves, and future-proof tourism in Ireland.  I have asked the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to go to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  He stated he would do so.   I have asked it of other Ministers in the House.  People are telling me the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is looking backward; he is not looking forward.  I am in business.  I know that when you are in business, you have to look forward and move forward.<\/p> <p> This is about 11,000 jobs.  It would cost &euro;7.5 million for them to qualify to be on the wage subsidy scheme.  Businesses in other sectors have been on the wage subsidy scheme all year because they did not meet their targets.  Some business came off it because they projected they would reach their target, but some of those businesses are not affected by Covid because they can still work and the projections have not been interfered with.  The hospitality sector, however, is the one sector that has been affected twice.  I am pleading with the Minister to save 11,000 jobs and future-proof the hospitality industry by putting in &euro;7.5 million for the sector so the wage subsidy scheme can go ahead for businesses that do not qualify because they have gone marginally over the limit.<\/p> <p> I have been raising the issue of fuel costs in the House in recent weeks.  I even highlighted it by bringing a truck onto the grounds of Leinster House.  My secondary school maths might not be as good as that of many Deputies but I know how to add, multiply, subtract and divide.  By my calculations - I am not out by much - the Government has taken in &euro;8 billion as a result of the extra tax increase on fuel since January 2020.  I calculated the figure on the basis that an average car burns &euro;100 worth of fuel, which is approximately 12 gallons.  The price of fuel has increased by 19 cent per litre.  On the basis of 2.2 million cars, it works out at approximately &euro;1.2 billion in extra tax.  I then considered the truck industry.  There are approximately 40,000 heavy goods vehicles, HGVs.  I worked out that figure as well, which is &euro;1.6 billion.  The light goods vehicles, that is, vehicles under 3.5 tonnes, of which there are 338,000, account for &euro;2 billion.  The balance is accounted for by the agricultural sector - the tractors that are used to put food on our table, set crops in the ground and feed animals.  It adds up to &euro;8 billion in extra tax.<\/p> <p> I stood with farmers in Musgraves the other day.  I met them to hear their concerns.  I have met the IFA and other groups and heard their concerns.  We all need to consider how we can improve things.  I do not believe farming is the problem in the context of emissions, much as the Government states it is the problem.  I believe the statistics put forward by the Government are wrong because it has not allowed for putting slurry directly into the ground.  There are different sectors of it that have not been allowed for, so the statistics are wrong.<\/p> <p> I want to save the planet.  Ireland accounts for 0.01% of the issue on the planet but we have more sanctions than any other European country.  The sanctions imposed in Ireland are the highest in Europe.  The Government statistics go by head of population, using a figure of 5 million people, so we are higher.  Everyone in the world wants products from Ireland because we have the best grass, milk, beef and freshly grown vegetables.  That is why everyone wants Irish products.  However, the Government is pricing Irish farmers out of the market.  It is pricing the future generation of farmers out of the market. <\/p> <p> I will finish on this.  I implore the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and his Government to ask the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to see common sense and save 11,000 jobs in a sector where businesses have lost four months of revenue.  The Government should not be short-sighted.  If the scheme is to be amended for those workers only, that is fine.  I want to save 11,000 jobs and I am using common sense.  When you consider the billions of euro the Government is taking from people on fuel alone, let alone the extra tax it is taking on food, clothes and shoes, the &euro;7.5 million it would cost to save those jobs is not out of the way.  The Government takes a margin of tax on everything that is in this building.  I just looked at fuel.  A sum that does not even equate to 1% of what the Government is taking in can save 11,000 jobs.<\/p> <p> The creation of 100 jobs in Limerick was announced yesterday.  I welcome those jobs.  I would welcome the creation of one job in Limerick.  I welcome the creation of jobs anywhere in the country.  An investment of &euro;70 million has been put in to get those 100 jobs in Limerick.  I am sorry that I was not present for the announcement.  I had to come up here and represent the rest of the country.  I wish the company well.  I hope it will employ far more people.  I hope every employer in the country will employ more people.  However, for today, I want the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to use common sense and his power as Minister to persuade the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to save 11,000 jobs in the hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500040#TT00400","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639582320,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Part of the Bill relates to ensuring money can be rolled over from projects that are not completed or carried out in the current year and transferred to the following year.

It is totally unfair on those people.  Of the 676 schemes, there are 90 or so old applications going back as far as 2006 or 2007 that were lumped in with the applications submitted in 2018.  That is very wrong.  Many of them are still waiting.<\/p> <p>I ask that any money hanging around should be directed to the local improvement schemes in Kerry.<\/p> <p> There is another aspect of the local improvement scheme that was called an emergency hardship scheme.  It related to roads used by nurses, doctors or home help personnel to visit a patient.  That scheme would help those people but for the past four or five years we have not got a bob for those kinds of roads.  We are in dire straits.  I know money cannot be left behind so I am in favour of the Bill if the Government ensures it directs any money left over towards two schemes, which are the local improvement and emergency hardship schemes.

I recall a time when the haggling over even a few thousand euro in his Department would make one blanch but the Department has stepped up to the plate and been able not only to respond but also to come in with very solid public finances at the end.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the opportunity to have an important end-of-year reflection on our priorities.  Covid-19 has, understandably, dominated our thinking but I will speak to four important areas where I have done much work with colleagues.  They are care of the child; building a circular economy strategy; securing the future of local media; and vacancy, dereliction and the opportunity to drive the revival of our town, village and urban centres.  In all four areas we need to do much better because we are putting at risk resources that will be crucial to the country's well-being.  We must significantly reprioritise these areas as national priorities.<\/p>  <p>  It is really important we do this in a way that is well thought through.  We have produced four papers on these matters and they have been developed by conducting wide public engagement, particularly with those people at the coalface.  We have also produced detailed analysis of gaps and how they can be tackled by practical policy innovation.  As parties in government, we must continue to be innovative and not just leave it to Ministers, good and all as their work may be.  It is essential if evidence-based policymaking is to survive and thrive at a time it is under such enormous pressure by much more populist policy thinking.  It is important for us to encourage and support this sort of engagement.<\/p>  <p>  In the time available I will deal with the four areas only briefly.  With regard to the care of the child, it is long recognised that the underdevelopment of early childhood policies in this country is selling short the coming generation and putting many people under immense pressure, including parents and women in particular, because they must make enormous sacrifices and endure much stress to manage.  Those providing the services are frustrated and those running them do not know where their future lies.  I welcome the changes made by the Minister in the provisions for the sector but we need genuine innovation beyond what is now being contemplated.  We need to see the emergence of a campus-type approach to early childhood provision and innovative access to buildings such as schools, owned or developed by the State, where there is an opportunity to use them.  Sports facilities could similarly be used.  However, such provisions are simply not being made for children in early childhood.  We need a new careers structure and I know the Minister is working on that.  We need much more local responsiveness and a much stronger role for the county childcare committees.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how much attention the Minister has given to the circular economy, which has operated under the radar somewhat.  Globally, we are using one and a half times what nature can replenish and Ireland is massively out of line in this respect.  We use 60% more non-renewable materials than the rest of Europe per head of population.  That is not just fossil fuels but all the other materials as well.  Our recycling rate is low and falling, and it is only 10% in the crucial construction sector.  Our food waste is equivalent to 1 million cars on the road in terms of climate impact and our circularity rate, which refers to how much we reuse materials to keep them in the cycle, is at 1.6%, which is the lowest in Europe except for Romania.  It is one eighth of the average across Europe.  We must radically change if our enterprises are to be competitive in the zero-carbon and green wave economy that will break upon us.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal briefly with local media.  We risk seeing the end of a diverse and reliable local media, which we have seen as having such value during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our support to the media sector is simply no longer fit for purpose and the diversity of local media is extremely vulnerable in the face of global \"tall pines\" in the form of social media platforms, which scorch the earth beneath.  We risk seeing the end of much of the diversity of local media that gives communities their vibrancy.<\/p>  <p>  There is the question of decay versus town renewal.  Approximately 70,000 idle homes are within reach of public policy to activate.  In the past four years we have managed to activate 1,800 of them but if all counties did as well as Waterford, we would have activated 9,000 properties.  With relatively small policy changes we could make an immense difference.  The town centre first policy can genuinely breathe life back into our communities if it is pursued in an innovative way.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk across politics about the need for change.  I totally agree with the constant need for change and within the Government we must demonstrate that we have that capacity in adopting new approaches like those I have outlined.  There was a time when the Opposition felt the need to develop tested policies as an alternative to what is happening and they would form the basis for the contention to enter into government.  We have now seen a change in that Opposition parties only seek to offer counterfeit change policies as a basis for entering government.  Shameless blame games are portrayed daily by those in the Opposition and magic money appears in debates about childcare.  There is a complete locking out of the private sector in the case of both the care of the child and our housing crisis.  There is denial that polluters should pay and contribute to the very difficult transition we must make.  Such action even goes as far as introducing a Bill banning offshore wind energy generation.<\/p>  <p>  We must get real about the changes that are coming and the way we prepare for them.  I wish the Minister well in his work but I ask that he would take those few suggestions on board as he plans for the next couple of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500042#VV00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1639582920,"counter":211,"content":"<p>We are dealing with this legislation because we need to.  We all get the ins and outs of this Bill ensuring that capital money that is unspent will be deferred.  I will deal with a number of matters that Deputy Bruton spoke about and on which I agree with him on some level, although clearly not what he said at the end.  He spoke about some of the weaknesses we see in childcare and the fact that we have not put a fit-for-purpose system together.  It is absolutely incumbent on the Opposition parties to put forward proposals in this regard.  We do not have an alternative system that we can test and all we can do is put our costed proposals forward for lessening the impact of childcare costs on families out there.<\/p>  <p>  We must go further in that regard and I have spoken many times about how the State has failed absolutely on the ideas of required community and family supports.  We are dealing with a major number of social issues, including long-term and multigenerational unemployment, poverty and drugs on top of these.  We are dealing with cases where we have failed to make interventions for communities and families.  We have let desperate situations continue from generation to generation.<\/p> <p>We deal with the issues, whether they relate to criminality, antisocial behaviour or those who do not necessarily have the skills that are required.  It is incumbent on the State to carry out an audit not just in regard to those general situations such as dealing with childcare but also in regard to the issues where we find them, including those weaknesses in society we have failed to deal with.  Having said that, it will take a much longer conversation than the three minutes of my contribution to this debate to put proposals forward.<\/p> <p> A European Council meeting is to be held this week and the European Union is considering possibilities in respect of block-buys and alternatives.  It is putting together a toolbox regarding how states can possibly mitigate some of the worst aspects of the energy crisis.  The &euro;100 rebate proposal that was put forward has been put on the back burner.  It was not particularly useful.  If we are to talk about certain issues we face relating to capital, we will need to get into the planning issues.  Everybody from National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has spoken about difficulties.  We hope the Attorney General's review will lead to action and to doing what is necessary.

As they highlighted, the Bill is an important piece of housekeeping in which the Oireachtas has to engage every year to ensure we have a proper legal basis for the moneys that were spent over the course of that year and to ensure spending can continue into the following year before the House approves the Estimates for that year.<\/p>  <p>  The issues raised over the course of this debate were many and varied.  A number of Deputies highlighted the exceptional support that has been provided by way of public expenditure in the context of Covid-19.  It is worth underlining that a total of &euro;30 billion in direct expenditure measures has been provided over 2020 and 2021.  The figure for last year was &euro;16.6 billion in Covid-related spending, while the equivalent figure for the current year is about &euro;13.4 billion.  The main elements of that &euro;30 billion speak to our response and where our priorities lie as a country in the handling of Covid-19 and the impact it has had on the people.<\/p>  <p>  For example, the Department of Social Protection accounted for an additional &euro;19 billion over the past two calendar years.  More than &euro;9 billion of that sum related to the pandemic unemployment payment, which of course was set up in emergency circumstances in March 2020 when hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs overnight.  It was an appropriate response to ensure households would continue to be supported during that period and the period since then.  In addition, the employment wage subsidy scheme and its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, account for just over &euro;9 billion over that period.  Over the course of this debate, Deputies again raised issues with the continuation of that scheme, but it has helped to pay the wages, in part or in full, of about 700,000 workers at some point in the past 21 months or so.  Overall, it has been a remarkable success in protecting that connection between the employer and the employee over that period.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the Department of Health and the HSE account for a large share of the additional expenditure.  There has been almost &euro;4.5 billion in additional Covid-related spending for the Department of Health since early 2020, which was used to improve capacity in the system and for personal protective equipment, PPE, test and trace resources, the vaccination programme and so on.  In addition, we provided almost &euro;900 million in additional funding to the Department of Education, primarily to ensure our schools could reopen and remain open in the face of the very challenging environment they have faced with Covid-19.  Similarly, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science received an additional sum of almost &euro;600 million in the context of Covid-19 over that period.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the wage subsidy schemes, we have provided further supports to businesses to ensure the continuation of employment, for example, through the local authority rates waiver, with almost &euro;1.5 billion provided.  We have refunded local authorities 100% of the value of that rates waiver, which was passed on to qualifying businesses.  There have also been restart grants and other very important measures in the July stimulus package, and we have sustained funding in a number of other key policy areas such as transport.  Because of the imposition of public health restrictions, there was a significant reduction over the past two years in the number of people using our public transport system and the State has had to step in and provide extra support.<\/p>  <p>  Both last year and this year, the State has done what it does best, namely, support our people, invest in public services and infrastructure and ensure we can continue to look after people to the best of our ability.  The Bill is important in that it will underpin that spending in 2021 and enable us to continue with that spending in the early part of next year until the Estimates come back from the committees and are passed.  I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and look forward to the remaining Stages of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500043#WW00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639583520,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Appropriation Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1639583520,"counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500043#WW00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639583520,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639583520,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The Bill, which is certified to be a money Bill in accordance with Article 22.2.1&deg; of the Constitution, will be sent to the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500043#WW01000","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Explanation by Minister of State","time":1639583520,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500043#WW01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1639583520,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has informed the Ceann Comhairle that she wishes to make a personal explanation to the House pursuant to Standing Order 56.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500043#WW01200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1639583520,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I wish to make a personal explanation pursuant to Standing Order 56 and to correct the record of the House concerning my concluding statement on Thursday, 11 November, during the D&aacute;il debate on the Farrelly commission of investigation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked me if there were other national independent review panels, NIRPs, in place in disability services.

Leis an mBille nua seo, t&aacute; bunsraith l&aacute;idir leagtha s&iacute;os d&uacute;inn, mar St&aacute;t, chun f&iacute;orcheannaireacht a l&eacute;iri&uacute; i dtaobh an teanga a chaomhn&uacute; do na gl&uacute;ine at&aacute; le teacht.<\/p><p>Ar nd&oacute;igh, bh&iacute; taca&iacute;ocht don Ghaeilge mar bhunchloch ag polasaithe gach Rialtas &oacute;n ch&eacute;ad l&aacute; riamh.  Bhain an mh&oacute;rchuid den reachta&iacute;ocht maidir leis an Ghaeilge suas go dt&iacute; deireadh an 20&uacute; haois le hoideachas agus leis an nGaeltacht fhisici&uacute;il a leagadh amach in 1956, go dt&iacute; gur achta&iacute;odh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003, a raibh s&eacute; mar aidhm aige creatlach nu&aacute;lach a chur ar f&aacute;il do fheabhs&uacute; na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Is liosta le lua &eacute; liosta na bhforbairt&iacute; ar st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il na teanga a th&aacute;inig chun cinn &oacute; aithn&iacute;odh an Ghaeilge mar an phr&iacute;omhtheanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta faoin mBunreacht in 1937 agus &oacute; rinneadh saini&uacute; ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta 19 bliain ina dhiaidh sin.  In 1972, 16 bliain ina dhiaidh sin, thosaigh Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta ag craoladh agus th&aacute;inig TG4 ar an aer in 1996.  Is fi&uacute; tr&aacute;cht a dh&eacute;anamh ar Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012, an tAcht Air&iacute; agus R&uacute;naithe (Leas&uacute;), 1956, an tAcht um &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, 1979 agus an tAcht um Chomhaont&uacute; na Breataine-na h&Eacute;ireann, 1999, a bhfuil an Bille nua seo ag teacht sna s&aacute;la orthu.<\/p><p>Buna&iacute;odh Roinn na Gaeltachta faoi alt 3 den Acht Air&iacute; agus R&uacute;naithe (Leas&uacute;), 1956 chun &ldquo;leas cult&uacute;rtha, s&oacute;isialach agus geilleagrach na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.&quot;  Bh&iacute; Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Deirg, Liam Mac Cuinneag&aacute;in, Gear&oacute;id Mac Pharthal&aacute;in agus Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Coile&aacute;in i l&aacute;r na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta maidir le bun&uacute; na Roinne nua.  Aithn&iacute;odh na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in agus na constaic&iacute; a bhaineann le cosaint na Gaeilge agus &iacute; ag maireacht&aacute;il taobh le taobh le m&oacute;rtheanga dhomhanda an Bh&eacute;arla.  Bh&iacute; na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in sin le feice&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht ach go h&aacute;irithe, &aacute;it ina raibh an d&aacute;theangachas tagtha chun cinn go m&oacute;r agus &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge mar phr&iacute;omh-mhe&aacute;n cumars&aacute;ide an teaghlaigh agus an phobail faoi bhr&uacute; lean&uacute;nach d&aacute; r&eacute;ir.  D'&uacute;s&aacute;id an t-iarAire Oideachais, Riste&aacute;rd Ua Maolchatha, na focail seo le linn na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta D&aacute;la maidir le bun&uacute; Roinn na Gaeltachta faoin Acht Air&iacute; agus R&uacute;naithe (Leas&uacute;), 1956:<\/p> <blockquote> \tN&iacute; g&aacute; dhom dul siar ar na hiarrachta&iacute; a rinneadh le breis agus deich mbliana fichead anuas ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.

Mar sin, ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an gc&uacute;lra a bhaineann leis an mBille le comhth&eacute;acs a thabhairt don l&aacute; stairi&uacute;il seo.  Achta&iacute;odh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003 i m&iacute; I&uacute;il 2003 agus ba iad na pr&iacute;omhaidhmeanna a bh&iacute; ag an Acht sin n&aacute; timpeallacht a chruth&uacute; ina mbeadh r&oacute;l n&iacute;os l&aacute;rna&iacute; ag an teanga in obair an St&aacute;it, go mbeadh an teanga n&iacute;os feice&aacute;la&iacute;, agus go mbeadh f&aacute;il i bhfad n&iacute;os leithne ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.

Ba iad na bpr&iacute;omhaidhmeanna a bh&iacute; ag an mBille n&aacute; sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; nua a leagan s&iacute;os don Ghaeltacht agus leasuithe a dh&eacute;anamh ar strucht&uacute;r agus ar fheidhmeanna &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Faoi Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012, buna&iacute;odh an Ghaeltacht feasta ar chrit&eacute;ir theangeola&iacute;ocha seachas ar limist&eacute;ir th&iacute;reola&iacute;ocha, mar a bh&iacute; i gceist go dt&iacute; sin.

Sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo, ba chinneadh r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach don Ghaeilge &eacute; deireadh a chur leis an maol&uacute; ar a h&uacute;s&aacute;id san Aontas Eorpach in 2022.  De bharr an chinnidh seo, t&aacute; deiseanna ar f&aacute;il do chainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge san Eoraip, &aacute;it ina mbeidh fosta&iacute;ocht d'ardchaighde&aacute;n ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.

The EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees.  Since the introduction of the scheme, it has reflected an economy-wide policy that operates across all sectors.  It is widely acknowledged as a very successful policy intervention that has provided vital support to businesses across the country during a very challenging time.<\/p>  <p>  The overall support provided for the EWSS to date, that is, up to 9 December, amounts to more than &euro;6.6 billion, comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of some 696,900 employees.  As part of budget 2022, the Government agreed the EWSS would remain in place in graduated form until 30 April 2022, with these arrangements provided for in section 70 of the Finance Bill 2021.  It was proposed, as part of the gradual unwinding of this temporary emergency measure, that the EWSS would revert back to its original two-rate structure from 1 December 2021.  However, as announced on Thursday last, it has been decided to maintain the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy for a further two months, namely, December 2021 and January of next year.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration was given to providing targeted support for businesses that are subject to the latest public health restrictions using a modified version of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  However, on further consideration and analysis of the available data, it proved to be administratively very complex to design such a scheme and it would not have been possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as had been intended.  Instead, maintaining the enhanced rates of subsidy under the EWSS for a further two months offers a relatively more efficient and effective way to support affected businesses in the immediate term.  This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.  It will assist businesses during the Christmas period, especially those in certain sectors, such as the hospitality sector, that may be operating at lower levels than anticipated due to recent public health restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the House that Revenue has confirmed it is possible to pay the enhanced rates of subsidy to businesses in a timely manner.  All eligible EWSS payroll submissions received from last Friday onwards will be processed using the enhanced subsidy rates.  In addition, Revenue has confirmed that it is currently identifying any relevant payroll submissions that may require a top-up to bring such payments in line with the enhanced rates, and payments will be made to employers shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The consistent approach of the Government has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support under this scheme.  At the same time, it is clear the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period, given the very substantial cost to the Exchequer.  As such, from 1 February 2022, the parameters for EWSS as announced on budget day will apply.  For February 2022, a two-rate structure of &euro;151.50 and &euro;203 will apply.  For March and April 2022, the final two months of the scheme, a flat-rate subsidy of &euro;100 will be put in place.  The reduced rate of employers' PRSI will no longer apply for these two months.  Businesses availing of the EWSS on 31 December 2021 will continue to be supported until the scheme concludes on 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has adopted a proactive and dynamic approach to supporting businesses and individuals insofar as possible during this challenging time.  We will continue to monitor health and economic developments closely.  I am pleased to confirm that these recommendations were approved by Seanad &Eacute;ireann last night.  I commend them to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500047#AAA01600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1639586520,"counter":287,"content":"<p>We support the extension of the EWSS and the CRSS schemes.

The pandemic continues to impact particular sectors of the economy.  We should remind ourselves that these are the ones that have been hit the hardest and most consistently right from the beginning through to now.  Everybody has been affected by the pandemic in one shape or form.  To be honest, the past two years have been pretty grim.  For some people, the impact suffered has been psychological, social, to do with their children, etc.  For other people, however, the experience of the pandemic has brought a repeated financial and economic hit in addition to those broader health, psychological and social impacts.  It is absolutely right, therefore, that we should continue the supports, such as the EWSS, to maintain the relationship between employees and their employers and to ensure that these support schemes can cover some of their ongoing costs.<\/p>  <p>  It is not enough to do that, however, given that the Minister is tabling last-ditch amendments, and he is correct to do so, in respect of the businesses that benefit from these schemes.  In that context, why is it that the people who have been short-changed throughout this entire pandemic are, yet again, the ones primarily affected in this regard?  I have had repeated engagements with the Minister, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, concerning, primarily, the plight of the self-employed and what I think are called ancillary workers in the context of the EWSS.  These are people who are considered ancillary but who are impacted by the beneficiaries of the EWSS.  They are excluded.  Critically, tens of thousands of self-employed people are not getting the support they need, even though they have had to fight the hardest and have benefited the least from the supports that have been available.  Why are last-ditch efforts not being made to ensure that they also have supports going into Christmas?<\/p>  <p>  Maybe this perspective has not got through to the Government, or perhaps it is deliberate.  I made this appeal to the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform last night.  I am going to keep doing it until the last day of the D&aacute;il in order to try to get some movement on this issue, or at least some answers and clarity.  Thousands of people are experiencing confusion, anxiety and concern regarding whether they are going to have any income, what level of income they may have or whether the income they will be given will be sufficient to support them because their work has collapsed as a result of Covid-19.  Those people do not benefit from these schemes.  They had previously benefited from the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and some of them also benefited from the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS.  I do not understand why last-ditch moves or amendments in this regard are not also being rushed through the D&aacute;il this week as well.  I just do not understand why that is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  In case the Minister is not aware of this situation, as we speak, hundreds if not thousands of musicians, entertainers, taxi drivers and people involved with the night-time economy are being refused PUP.  We were told last week that they would get PUP, but they are being refused it.  They are receiving letters stating that if they cannot show that they had four weeks PRSI contributions in the week before 7 December, they will not be eligible for the payment.  That is a ridiculous request to make of the self-employed because they do their taxes at the end of the year.  By definition, they are not getting any support from these schemes even though their work has collapsed.  Other people are still on the PUP.  The Minister will remember that there are different cohorts in this regard because people were being phased off the payment, from &euro;350 down to &euro;250 and then down to &euro;205.  They were finally forced onto jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  If people had signed off, and then, on 7 December or after, went back on the PUP, it is possible for them to get to &euro;350 if their applications are not refused on the basis of this PRSI contribution requirement.  Theoretically, however, it might be possible for people in that situation to get the PUP.<\/p>  <p>  People who were on the lower rate because they were being phased down the PUP payment rates will not now be able to apply for the higher rate, even though the lower rate was phased down on the basis of the fact that the amount of work it was possible for people to do and the level of income it was possible for them to make was rising when that happened.  That was the whole principle behind those changes in the payment.  All those people, though, have now seen the additional income they could earn because of the lifting of restriction collapse again overnight.  I am getting desperate calls from drivers telling me that all the night-time work is gone and that they are waiting for four and five hours at the airport, but there are no fares.  All the office workers are being told to stay at home, so all that kind of work is gone as well.  It is possible that further restrictions are will be imposed at the end of this week, which could impact their ability to work even more.  There is some shopping activity and some people are going to work around town, so it might be thought that there is loads of work.  There is not, however.<\/p>  <p>  The situation is even worse for musicians, because their work is just gone.  All the gigs they expected to have in December are not happening, but they are being asked in interviews relating to qualifying for social welfare payments if they can prove that they have lost income.  How exactly are they meant to prove that?  Do they have to get letters from all the people with whom they had arranged gigs in December and then bring them to the Intreo office if they can get an appointment over the next week?  I would say there is a fat chance of that happening.  It is ridiculous stuff.<\/p>  <p>  Let us remember what the Government said at the beginning of this crisis.  It stated that the PUP would be given to everybody because everybody is impacted and the eligibility criterion for the PUP then was that people&rsquo;s income and ability to earn had been significantly reduced or had gone.  We did not give people loads of hoops to jump through.  What we are doing now, though, is refusing people's applications or giving them multiple hoops to jump through, which they cannot possibly do before Christmas.  It is grossly unfair.  I reiterate that these people who are facing this situation a week before Christmas are the same people who have been repeatedly hit the most often and the hardest right from the beginning of the pandemic.  Yet they are now being hit again in the week before Christmas.  I appeal on their behalf to the Minister to do something before Christmas for the people in these categories, who, self-evidently, have been impacted by the latest round of health measures and by the arbitrary date concerning when the measures were brought in, namely, 7 December.  It is ridiculous.  Many people scaled back their social activities and outings last week-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500048#BBB00500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1639586520,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The Deputy can continue, but the time is limited and there are other speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500048#BBB00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1639586520,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I know, and I want to be fair to others.

This arbitrary cut-off means that people impacted on or after that date are okay but anything that happened before then does not count for those people who apply or who were on something else.  I am asking that the PUP be given to these people who have self-evidently had their work and incomes hit or reduced and that this PRSI contribution requirement be taken out of the qualification criteria because it does not apply to the self-employed.  That is what they are being told is required, however.  In addition, the MEBAS scheme for musicians will apparently not be reviewed until January 2022.

The hospitality sector is especially impacted.  This extension is a common-sense measure and one that Sinn F&eacute;in called for on 30 November.  The Government decided on the measure prior to the subsidy rates being cut on 1 December.  This delayed response is to be welcomed.  I note that the Minister performed a U-turn in respect of reversing the wage subsidy cuts, having announced on 3 December that he would provide targeted supports.  Those announced proposals were consigned to the dustbin, with an admission that they could not have been implemented with the necessary speed.  This is evidence of a lack of planning in the Department, particularly regarding the tailoring of supports over time to those sectors most impacted.<\/p>  <p>  What we have now are economy-wide supports for what is, for the most part, a sector-specific issue.  I remind the House that my colleague, Deputy Doherty, submitted an amendment 16 months ago to alter the EWSS in order that different rates of payments could be applied to different sectors.<\/p> <p>This proposal was rejected on the grounds that one sector could not be prioritised above another.  This justification was somewhat undermined by the roll-out of the CRSS months later, which only provides support to consumer-facing businesses and was therefore sector-specific for all intents and purposes.  I ask the Minister and his Department to examine the possibility of tailoring the wage subsidy scheme to provide tailored supports for specific sectors.  We will be supporting this recommendation given its overall objective to support employment.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 3 provides for the extension of the CRSS.  Given the impact of the latest public health restrictions on the night-time and experience economy this is a common-sense recommendation that Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting to ensure that supports to that sector are provided to protect employment, businesses and livelihoods.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500048#BBB00900","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639587120,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The wage subsidy scheme has helped every other business to go through a very hard time.  However, I have been on to the Minister's office more than once about the 18% of the hotel industry that does not qualify under the scheme because they cannot register before 31 December.  That means they have over 70% of their earnings compared to the 2019 accounts.<\/p>  <p>  The hotel industry has not only lost November and December but its worst months are January and February.  That means they have lost four months.  What they needed to make in November and December was to carry them through January and February so they would be ready for the tourism season in March and for the rest of the year.  The Minister is telling me he cannot reverse this and it cannot be implemented.  I am asking him to put in an amendment.  Anyone who was on the wage subsidy scheme from this year should qualify to go on to it for next year.  It is not new applicants but existing applicants who have been availing of the scheme and were interfered with from the point of view of income for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I said I would give the Minister a figure so he might be able to go back and find the funding.  This was costed at &euro;7.5 million to save 11,000 jobs on the wage subsidy scheme for January and February of next year.  While the Government launched the stay and spend initiative to great ceremony, it was unsuccessful.  This initiative was targeted at the hospitality industry and the Government set aside &euro;250 million for this scheme.  As only &euro;300,000 was claimed under that scheme, that means there is &euro;249,700,000 left that was put aside for it.  I am asking for &euro;7.5 million to save 11,000 jobs on the wage subsidy scheme for next year.  They are not asking to go on it for November and December this year.  They are asking to go in on 1 January because they do not qualify under the Government's scheme.  The hospitality sector has been hit twice.  It was hit in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  It needs the help.  The Minister has to understand that January and February are when they have the lowest income coming in.  They make their money in November and December.  With the restrictions that have been put in place, and I believe on Friday the Government is looking at more possible restrictions, these hoteliers will not survive.  That means we have 11,000 jobs that could end up going on the PUP or on the live register and that might never be returned to hospitality.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister to protect and save the hospitality industry, including the musicians who need to be subsidised as well.

As the Minister is aware, I have been raising the issue of the moneys that were allocated to the stay and spend scheme and that have not been spent this year for a variety of reasons.  The scheme itself was not a bad idea but because of the conditions that pertained for much of this year, it was simply not possible for it to operate in the way that it ought to have.  I understand a recommendation was made in the Seanad yesterday to that effect.  It is something the Minister might consider.<\/p><p>The employment wage subsidy scheme and temporary wage subsidy scheme were extraordinary interventions by the Government.  It is to the Minister's eternal credit and the credit of the last Government that had hold of the ball when we were in that very difficult situation in March 2020.  Great credit is also due to IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for assisting in the development of the scheme.  It was phenomenally successful, keeping people close to their employers and employed at a time when they could easily have lost their jobs.  The scarring effect of losing a job at that time would have been inordinate for society and the economy.<\/p><p>The Minister knows that I have been arguing from the get-go for very strict social, economic, labour and environmental conditions to be attached to the disbursement of billions of euro in taxpayers' money to businesses that were relying on these schemes to keep people in work.  Despite the various calls I made, amendments I proposed and questions I raised in this House, no such conditions were attached.  I said consistently that we were outliers in the European context in attaching no social, economic or labour conditions whatsoever for qualification for the scheme outside of some minor thresholds applied by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>The Minister will have read the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning and the comments made by his colleague in government, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  He expressed his concerns that a company that paid &euro;1.8 million in dividends also received &euro;1.8 million in wage subsidies through the Irish taxpayer, by coincidence.  The interests of the taxpayer have not been looked after in that respect.  No conditions were attached.  When I was calling for conditions to be attached to the EWSS and previously the TWSS around no lay-offs, payment of no bonuses or dividends and in respect of companies registered in tax havens but operating here, I was given a deaf ear.  The proposals were not entertained.  How did this morning's article sit with the Minister?

As Deputy Boyd Barrett acknowledged on other occasions, we have, through the EWSS and CRSS, done so much to try to bring so many into a safety net to help them when the disease is causing harm.  I have acknowledged to the Deputy on a few occasions that there have been groups of workers who have been outside the scope of these schemes.  With regard to the CRSS, the Deputy raised with me the circumstances of the many businesses that do not have a premises.  With regard to the EWSS, there were some workers who were not able to benefit under the programme as constructed.  I will raise the issues the Deputy has emphasised in respect of musicians and others working in our night-time economy.  Their plight is the reason we have reopened the PUP.  I hear the Deputy's point that those on the previous rate of PUP are now on a lower level than those who joined more recently.  I understand that issue but, until the latest public health restrictions, we had been making so much progress on trying to get people back to work and reopen our economy.  I am aware the Department of Social Protection is doing its best to handle this issue as sensitively as it can.  I hear the Deputy's point regarding the date we picked, but it was picked because it was the one on which the public health guidance was issued and that did have a bigger effect on the economy.  I understand the Deputy's point, however.  While I hope the arguments I am making make sense, there are people who are not eligible according to the dates and programmes we are discussing this evening.  Therefore, I will discuss this again with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, to see where we stand on sectoral schemes that can make a difference for those affected by the issues the Deputy is raising.  Those schemes have worked well in the past.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Farrell for the support she offered tonight.  It is welcome to hear Sinn F&eacute;in offering support for a more tailored approach to how we will implement wage subsidy programmes in the future.  In recent weeks some of the challenges that will be involved in doing this have been demonstrated to me again.  The Deputy's support will be recognised by me when implementing the changes in 2022.<\/p> <p> On the points made by Deputy O'Donoghue, he and I have discussed this issue, including today, when he contacted my office on this matter.  I understand that there are some companies and hotels that are ineligible for the scheme, but I must emphasise to the D&aacute;il the huge amount of support the Government has provided to the hospitality sector because of the value we attach to the contribution it makes to our economy and society.  The hospitality sector alone has received &euro;1.5 billion through the EWSS since its introduction.  It needed it.  Under the CRSS, businesses have received &euro;426 million to support them at a time of such strain.<\/p> <p> The challenge I face is that, regardless of the level of business performance that I fix to allow entry into the scheme, there will be some companies that do not reach it.  A company that can show a decline of 30% or more for this year by comparison with 2019 is eligible to enter the CRSS, but I accept that some companies are just beyond the thresholds that are fixed and therefore unable to participate.  In a scheme of this scale, and with so much money going into it, we need to have entry points.  Without entry points, we would not be able to focus the huge amounts of money where they are needed the most.  It would raise the most difficult issues regarding how to get out of this.<\/p> <p> I am going to consider some of the issues that Deputy Nash raised with me in the past and that have come to light again today, but I emphasise that the vast majority of companies have needed to avail of the EWSS, as the Deputy acknowledged.  Some companies that found out they did not need the scheme as much as they thought they would returned the money to the Revenue Commissioners.  I recognise that and thank the companies in question.  I ask other companies to consider the practice that their peers have engaged in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500049#CCC00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639587720,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The time permitted for the debate having expired, I am required to put the following question in accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il of 14 December: \"That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann hereby accepts all the recommendations of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to the Finance Bill 2021.&rdquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500050#DDD00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639587720,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639587720,"counter":304,"content":"<p>A message will be sent to the Seanad acquainting it accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500050#DDD00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1639587720,"counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500050#DDD00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639587720,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639587720,"counter":307,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639587720,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:   \t<b>&quot;Report on extending availability of full Parent's Benefit to lone parents <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>9.<\/b>The Minister shall prepare and lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on extending the availability of the full duration of Parent's Benefit to lone parents to examine the effect that enabling all children to equally avail of the full duration of this Benefit would have and that the report shall be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection within nine months of the passing of this Act.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>  <p>This relates to an issue I raised with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on a number of occasions, namely, the duration of parental leave, which has been extended to seven weeks per parent.

If a child is born to a two-parent family, that family will get 14 additional weeks altogether, which is welcome, but if a child is born into a lone-parent family, it will mean just seven weeks, which is an awful lot less.  I am aware that the measure was brought in through the EU.  There were different ways in which it was brought in and there may have been difficulties, but I ask that we examine the benefit to ensure equality for lone-parent families and to ensure children born into and brought up in a lone-parent family have the same start in life as those born into a two-parent family.

It is not good practice to put references to the presentation of reports in primary legislation.  All of us in this House give out about chunky Bills.  The recent practice of requiring reports on legislation does not achieve anything.  I can produce reports without having them provided for in primary legislation.  When I give my word in this Chamber or at a meeting of a committee that I will produce a report, the Deputy will be able to hold me to account on that.<\/p> <p>I ask that requests for reports are not put in primary legislation.  I will be happy to give Deputy Kerrane and the other Deputies here such a commitment in respect of the various issues raised.<\/p> <p> As for this amendment, my Department does the payments in respect of parent's benefit.  It is the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that has the policy responsibility and the legislative responsibility.  I accept that Deputy Kerrane has brought this matter to my attention previously.  It has also been brought to my attention by One Family and I have raised the matter.  Under the EU work-life balance directive, parent's leave is not transferable between parents.  This recognises the importance of equality between men and women in respect of labour market opportunities and the importance of fathers bringing up their children.  It should encourage an increase in the number of men taking parent's leave.  A provision to allow one parent to take the dual entitlement to leave would place an increased burden on that individual's employer.  As the Deputy will be aware, the employee's eligibility for parent's benefit follows his or her eligibility for associated leave, assuming the social insurance contributions and other qualifying payments are met.  The policy on parent's leave is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  As I said, he has responsibility for this and I am happy to raise it with him.

I have raised this with him as well, but it was important to take the opportunity to raise it today.  I appreciate that there is a greater impact on the employer where only one parent takes leave but I stress again that this is about the child.  The child has to be central in this.

Amendments were recently brought forward by my party colleagues in the North to extend this to women who sadly suffer the loss of a baby through miscarriage.  I ask that the Minister consider giving this support in a statutory entitlement to a parent at probably the most devastating time in his or her life.  We know that the position on this varies a lot between employers.  Some give it; some do not.  Some parents have to go back to work a short time after a bereavement and really struggle.  A mother brought this to my attention.  She had lost her son through suicide and really struggled.  I ask that the Minister consider bringing in a payment similar to that available in the North of Ireland and that we seek to support parents at these really difficult times.<\/p><p>Lastly, often when we look at the budget and the social protection system we look at the existing system.

I understand what she is trying to achieve.  It is an awful time for any parent when he or she loses a child.  Caring leave such as <i>force majeure<\/i>and parental leave is, again, the policy responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  He is looking at the issue of bereavement leave, in particular for women who suffer miscarriages.  I asked my officials to raise this matter with his Department in order that we may look at this within the wider context of a parent who loses a child.<\/p><p>As Deputy Kerrane will be aware, within the social welfare system there are a number of supports for people who suffer bereavement.  If a person is in receipt of a primary social welfare payment which includes an increase for a qualified child and, tragically, that child dies, the qualified child payment will continue for six weeks after the child's death.  In the case of carer's allowance, payment continues to be made for 12 weeks after the death of the person who was being cared for, including where this is a child.  Domiciliary care allowance continues to be paid for three months after the death of the child being cared for.  The working family payment and the back-to-work family dividend also remain in payment for up to six weeks after the death of a qualifying child.<\/p><p>In budget 2020, &euro;60,000 was allocated to the Irish Hospice Foundation to carry out a research project on funeral poverty in Ireland together with the wider economic impact of bereavement.  That project is expected to be completed in the near future.

The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has already started some of this work.  It relates to his Department.  I support Deputy Kerrane in what she proposes.  It is the right thing to do and we want to support parents who find themselves in these awful and tragic circumstances.  My officials have raised this with their counterparts in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I will speak to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, about it.  I know that in New Zealand they have passed legislation on miscarriages, but we should look at this as a broader picture.  When somebody loses a child, what can we do to support him or her at that most awful time in his or her life?  I will be in contact with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I support what Deputy Kerrane says but I just cannot accept the amendment.

The amendment relates to the job of work of a report on the means-testing of the blind pension and disability allowance, which can both cause major difficulties for those who are trying to apply for and obtain either payment and those who are already in receipt of a payment.  The means test and the income limitations can cause difficulties to people who rely on these payments.  This would be a really useful piece of work for her Department to take on.  The matter has been raised by a number of the relevant organisations.  Many times when speaking about the blind pension I have given the example of a person who is blind for life.  I always refer to the woman who came into my constituency office with her partner.  He had got a promotion at work and an increased wage and she lost her blind pension.  She is blind but not entitled to the blind pension.  That is wrong.  I am not sure of the numbers, the cost and so on, and I appreciate that all of that has to be taken into consideration, but when a person is blind, he or she should be entitled to the blind pension.<\/p> <p>I welcome the publication of the cost of disability report last week.  However, taking blindness as an example, there is a cost to that.  A person who is blind and in receipt of the blind pension should be able to retain that payment.  That is really important.  The issue of income and the means test for the disability allowance is one that comes up all the time.  The cost of disability payment, when introduced, will of course make a difference.  However, there are issues overall with the blind pension and disability allowance when it comes to the means test.  It would be worthwhile if the Minister's Department would undertake some kind of exercise in relation to the means test, similar to that which I have called for elsewhere.  The amendment provides that the Minister will prepare and publish a report within nine months of the passing of the Act, which is a fair period of time.  Engagement with the sector will be important.

In last year's budget, I increased the earnings disregard from &euro;120 to &euro;140 for both disability allowance and the blind pension.  This means that the first &euro;140 of weekly earnings is fully disregarded in a means assessment.  In this year's budget, I announced that the earnings threshold, above which all means is fully assessed, is to be increased for both payments.  This will be done by regulation.  I am also increasing the general means disregard for disability allowance.  I keep the means assessment for all social assistance schemes under constant review.  In that regard, I am making significant amendments to the carer's allowance means test as part of this year's budget.  I am also increasing the threshold for single-parent households in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  In last year's budget, I removed the earnings limit on the one-parent family payment.  I assure the Deputy that while I do not propose to accept this amendment, I will keep the issue of the means test under review.

There is a recommendation that there be graduated payments based on the disability.  I will ask the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which is examining the report, to consider the specific issue the Deputy raised regarding the blind pension and disability allowance.  I spoke earlier at a meeting of the steering group, which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It received the cost of disability report today.  Indecon, the company that prepared the report, gave the group a full, in-depth explanation of where it got the data.  One of the main recommendations of the report, which runs to over 200 pages, is that disability payments be graduated based on a person's disability, which is individual to different people.  The means test can and should be looked at in this context.  The question is whether we should have two separate payments, a blind pension and a disability allowance, or one streamlined payment based on disability.  That is the question we need to ask and consider.  <\/p>  <p>  I will refer this specific issue to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group for consideration as part of its overall discussions.

Every year in July, in the pre-budget forum meeting with the numerous stakeholders and organisations working on the ground, adequacy is always cited as one of the key priorities.  The use of the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, is consistently raised by organisations working at the coalface.  The Minister is well aware of this.  In 2021, the basic aim of any social protection system should be to protect those who rely on it from poverty.  Our system does not do that.<\/p><p>This year, the minimum essential standard of living has been calculated at &euro;252 per week.  Basic payments will increase from &euro;203 by &euro;5 to &euro;208 in January.  While this is welcome, it is far from achieving the minimum essential standard of living.  I acknowledge that we cannot introduce the MESL overnight.  If the Government had at least indicated it was moving towards the MESL and would do so with &euro;5 increases or whatever the figure may be, at least we would be moving in the right direction.  However, that commitment has not been made.  The organisations are repeatedly calling for the MESL.  It would be useful if the Department were to undertake to review the introduction of these rates benchmarked to the minimum essential standard of living.  That would protect from poverty those who rely on these payments.  It would be an important measure and would benchmark our social protection payments, protecting people from poverty and allowing them a decent standard of living while they rely on social protection.  It would be a worthwhile exercise for the Department if the Minister would consider it.

The Government has committed to applying a benchmarking and indexation approach to State pension rates.  The roadmap for social inclusion also contains a commitment to prepare a report for the Government on the potential application of the benchmarking approach to other welfare payments.  I understand that my officials are working on that.  Significant work has been carried out to develop a methodology for benchmarking and indexing State pension rates.  This proposed approach has been endorsed by the Pensions Commission.  In addition, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will examine the social welfare system more generally as part of its work, and will submit its report to the Minister for Finance not later than next June.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has used the MESL research as a key input into the consideration of budget options in recent years.  I value the insights that the data provide.  The research recognises that increasing income supports is not the only means by which individuals and families can meet the minimum essential standard of living.  Improved services such as the extension of GP visit cards for children, as well as the affordable childcare scheme, can result in significant reductions in the minimum income standards needed by households.  In this respect, the MESL relates to issues wider than social welfare issues.  We do not believe it would be appropriate to carry out a review in isolation.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the MESL work as it is done for many years.  In fact, we funded the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice to produce a report on the issue.  We take it very seriously and we examine it.  The research the partnership produces and its recommendations have underpinned our budgets over many years.  That is why we introduce targeted measures.  If we implemented all the recommendations in the MESL report, it would cost &euro;2.7 billion.  We take advice from a number of different sources, such as the Central Statistics Office, the Economic and Social Research Institute, as well as the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.<\/p>  <p>  We have used the MESL research to inform policy.  For example, the higher rate of payments for children aged 12 years and over was introduced as a direct result of this research.  In addition, targeting resources at vulnerable populations at higher risk of poverty, for example, pensioners living alone, was also informed by the MESL research.  To bring all welfare payment rates up to the MESL would cost an additional &euro;2.7 billion.  The Deputy raised the question of the number of people who would benefit.<\/p> <p>We expect the figure to increase from 365,000 at a minimum to 400,000 people next year.  This is with regard to the fuel allowance.  It will bring in many more people.  The Deputy will appreciate that we always like to do more.  This has been the biggest social welfare budget in 14 years.  We will continue to work on it.  The ESRI report stated the four lowest income deciles will benefit from the tax and welfare measures announced in the budget with the largest gains in the bottom two deciles.

I am using this as a vehicle to raise the issue.  I hope the Minister can consider it.  I accept it is not good practice to include reports in primary legislation but it is the only mechanism available to us.  Section 20 of the Bill makes provision for income disregards for farm schemes.  We all welcome this.  It is very constructive.  The objective behind it is to try to encourage farmers to participate in the various farm schemes.  The list is being updated in the legislation before us.  We want to try to see low-income farmers supplement their income but take on board environmental measures that not only benefit their farms but also benefit our water quality, the environment generally and reduce our overall emissions profile.  As the Minister knows better than most, in our part of the country the age profile of suckler farmers, in particular, and beef farmers is quite high.  If we are going to bring about innovation and reduce the overall carbon footprint of this sector of agriculture, it will only happen if we can significantly reduce the age profile of these farmers and encourage younger farmers into agriculture to get access to the land and carry out the type of measures and alteration of farm practices that will reduce the carbon footprint of those farms.<\/p><p>I accept that under the social welfare code where a son or daughter of the retiring farmer continues the practice of farming there is no issue.  The difficulty arises, as the Minister and I both know, with farmers who do not have a son or daughter and who are leasing out the land.  They are left with a dilemma.  If they lease out the farm and have a stranger come in and work their farm where they have no control over it, every cent generated in the farm lease is deducted from the non-contributory old age pension.  There is absolutely no incentive for farmers in receipt of the non-contributory old age pension, who do not have a successor, to lease out the land.  We all know what they do.  They continue to slobber along doing what they have always done and what was done by their parents before them and the generation before that.  This is having an impact on the overall emissions profile of our suckler herd throughout the country and on reducing the carbon efficiency of the herd.<\/p><p>I want the Minister to look at this particular cohort of older farmers and see whether we can put some incentive in place for them to lease out their land.  If farmers go into various agricultural schemes, there is a disregard.  If farmers were to go out and work, there is a &euro;200 disregard for them.  However, if they lease the land to a young progressive farmer, whereby we would reduce the carbon footprint of that farm holding, we are saying that we will give them no credit whatsoever.  There is something wrong in a system that does not give some acknowledgement for this.  In fairness, the social welfare code recognises the need to encourage farmers to improve their carbon efficiency profile and improve environmental sustainability.  It is set out in section 20.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to look at the issue of leasing land whereby some encouragement would be given.  I accept she will not waive the full value of it.  I am not asking that the full value of it be waived.  However, perhaps a proportion could be waived, such as half of the disregard for someone out working.  Even if it were a disregard of &euro;100 a week at least it would be some incentive to encourage people to lease the land and improve the emissions profile of the holding.  I hope the Minister can ask the officials to look at this.  I do not think a huge cohort of people is involved.  It would make a significant difference to the emissions profile of our overall suckler herd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500053#GGG01500","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1639589520,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this issue.

I know the Deputy wants to see the income disregard introduced for older farmers who lease out their land.  He raised it on Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Bill extensively extends the list of agri-environment schemes that attract a disregard for the farm assist scheme and the non-contributory State pension.

The measure also extends the list of environmental schemes that attract a disregard in a corresponding way for the farm assist scheme and the non-contributory State pension.<\/p> <p>The measure in the Bill will, therefore, support older and younger farmers availing of these grants.  I do commit to carrying out a report on increasing the disregard for leasing land for the State non-contributory pension and farm assist.  The Deputy will be aware that the rent per acre of land has gone up in value and, in order to target resources at those most in need, we could not ignore entirely the rental income from leasing the land.  I take his point that we should consider giving some disregard there.

I tabled the amendment on foot of the experience of a constituent of mine and Deputy Kerrane's with whom I am personally dealing at the moment.  The husband of the constituent in question is in receipt of a contributory State pension.  She is getting the qualified adult allowance and the half-rate carer's allowance.  That is the only income going into that household.  The difficulty is that under the fuel allowance scheme as currently drafted, the half-rate carer's allowance is considered income.  If this woman's husband had not paid PRSI and, as such, was in receipt of the non-contributory State pension, and she was receiving the qualified adult allowance and the half-rate carer's allowance, they would be entitled to the full fuel allowance.  On top of that, she could actually go out and earn up to &euro;120 a week and still get the fuel allowance.  People who paid PRSI are significantly worse off due to this anomaly whereby the half-rate carer's allowance is considered income under a contributory pension but not under a non-contributory pension in the context of eligibility for the fuel allowance.  It is an anomaly in the system.  It is discriminating against this couple with no income other than what is coming in from the Minister's Department.  They have no supplementary income but they are in receipt of the half-rate carer's allowance, which is considered income.  If it is not considered income under the non-contributory State pension, a similar situation should pertain under the contributory State pension.  The half-rate carer's allowance should not be considered as income in that context.  That would ensure the couple would receive the fuel allowance just like everyone else.  There is probably only a relatively small number of people affected by this anomaly.  I do not think there is a big cost involved.  I ask the Minister to consider addressing this anomaly in the context of the Bill before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500054#HHH00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1639590120,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendment.  It is important that groups such as the people mentioned by the Deputy are included.  The fuel allowance scheme is very important for families on low incomes but it is narrow enough in terms of the definitions and who gets it.  In our alternative budget, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed extending by two weeks the period in which the fuel allowance is paid, but also broadening the eligibility bands.<\/p>  <p>  I know it is not dealt with in the Bill, but perhaps in future years a discretionary fund could be set up through the community welfare officer system such that a payment would be made to help people who have very high costs.  There should be some kind of discretionary fund to assist people.  That has been put forward by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It could be administered through the community welfare officers.  It is something the Department should seriously consider.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance scheme is welcome and it is always good that it is there to help people at that crucial time.  God knows, bills are sky high this year.  The measures are necessary, given the scale of the crisis we are facing, with unprecedented increases.  Households are facing the highest increases in my lifetime.  On average, fuel bills have gone up by 28% or 30% in the past 12 months.  That adds an extra &euro;450 or &euro;500 this winter for using a similar amount of energy to last year.  The increase in carbon tax has added to that cost, although I know the Government would say it does not add to it significantly.  This issue needs to be factored into future budgeting.  In the area in which I live, a bale of briquettes was &euro;3.50 a short time ago.  One shop is now charging &euro;6.70 per bale.  That is a significant increase.  The increase in carbon tax alone put an extra 20 cent on a bale of briquettes.  A bag of coal increased by 89 cent.  The increase in the carbon tax alone has added &euro;20 to the cost of the average refill of home heating oil.  I point that out to bring home the significant cost coming onto families.  It is placing enormous pressure on families who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, in rural areas it is different from urban areas.  There is no piped gas.  Laois-Offaly, for example, has the highest number of homes that are dependent on solid fuel.  Let us be fair about it.  Those houses will not be retrofitted.  There will not be a significant number of them retrofitted this year or next year.  It will take time to get through all of that.  We cannot have people freezing with the cold in the interim.  The charity ALONE has estimated that there are in the region of 3,000 deaths directly or indirectly related to fuel poverty each year.  That is one of the highest rates in Europe.  Almost 400,000 people experience some level of fuel deprivation in the State each year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government announced the payment of &euro;100 to offset the increase in energy bills.  Any such payment is welcome but I ask the Minister to try to fast-forward that payment.  It would have been great to see it coming before Christmas or very soon thereafter.  My understanding - the Minister can correct me if I am wrong - is that the payment may not come until late March.  I am not sure whether that is the case.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.  The payment is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance scheme requires changes and fine tuning.  The issue raised by Deputy Naughten in respect of those on half-rate carer's allowance in circumstances where a spouse is on a contributory pension is one that needs to be addressed.  There is also a need to consider part-time workers and low-paid workers.  Some of those households are among the poorest in the State.  Deputy Kerrane's office carried out an online survey for Sinn F&eacute;in recently.  The response from full-time workers, not to mention part-time workers, showed that a significant number of workers are experiencing poverty.  That is a reality we must face.  Bills have gone up and wages are not keeping pace with them.<\/p> <p>As we move forward, we should keep such matters under review while trying to ensure as many people as possible are assisted under the fuel scheme each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500054#HHH00700","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639590720,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I will be brief in speaking in support of amendment No. 8 because this is clearly an anomaly that has been identified.

Deputy Denis Naughten spoke about working and paying PRSI ,and I brought to the Minister's attention another anomaly that only recently came to my attention.  It relates to illness benefit and the fact that lone parents and widows who are working and paying PRSI cannot access this benefit.  If we are talking about anomalies involving people who are working and paying PRSI but who cannot access these payments, it is important to rectify such issues.  I had a case of a lone parent whose child got sick with Covid-19.  She applied for the Covid-19 illness benefit payment and could not access it because she was getting a payment because she is a lone parent.  It is also an issue for a widow receiving a widow's pension and who is working and paying PRSI.  She cannot access that illness benefit despite being very sick with Covid-19.  She ended up with long Covid and could not get illness benefit.<\/p>  <p>  This is an anomaly.  When people are working and paying PRSI, they should be able to access illness benefit.

I will ask my officials to do that and bring the report before the House.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is currently being paid to more than 365,000 households most at risk of fuel poverty for 28 weeks between October and April at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million.  As part of budget 2022, the rate of the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5, as Deputies noted, to &euro;33 per week, effective from budget day.  An increase in the means test threshold of &euro;20 has also been implemented with effect from budget day.  That did not happen before and we made sure both those measures kicked in from budget day.  The Department of Social Protection also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme and the household benefits package is separate from the fuel allowance scheme.  A further &euro;195 million will be spent on that scheme in 2021.  More than 482,000 households will benefit from this to assist with their gas and electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>  I know Deputy Kerrane has raised the question of a discretionary fund.

The 2016 census shows there are almost 75,000 cohabiting couples with child dependants, a figure likely to be even greater when the next census comes around.  If a couple are cohabiting, the Department of Social Protection will assess both their means when carrying out a means test for social assistance payments such as jobseeker's allowance or the carer's allowance.  It does not provide any guarantee to contributory social protection payments such as the widow's pension when one of them passes away.<\/p><p>The amendment seeks to make the treatment of all citizens equal.  Cohabiting has an impact on many State payments and supports, that is, not just social welfare payments but also medical cards, payments to mature students and many more examples.  A cohabiting couple cannot claim or transfer unused tax credits between themselves and there can also be an inherent tax burden when a partner passes away.  For the assessment of eligibility for social welfare payments, a cohabiting couple are treated as together for income assessment, just as married couples are, but not if one of them dies.<\/p><p>Some laws do not discriminate.  For example, the recent Affordable Housing Act provides for equal treatment of cohabiting couples to qualify for the purpose of an affordable dwelling if they plan to live together.  Cohabitation is recognised for some laws, therefore, but not for others.  It is time the law caught up with modern family life.  The citizens' assembly has called for Article 41 of the Constitution to be amended to protect private and family life not limited to the marital family.<\/p><p>I believe Ireland is going to get to where we need to go in respect of cohabiting couples and I hope we can get there a little more quickly.  With the Minister's help, we can do that through amendments to the Bill or some commitments that these kinds of changes can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500056#KKK00500","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1639591320,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and acknowledge Deputy Kerrane tabled a similar amendment, which we will get to shortly.  The amendment before us concerns a very broad measure that relates to many schemes in my Department but also concerns matters beyond my Department's remit, including potentially wider, constitutional matters.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act that confers both rights and obligations on both parties that do not exist in law between cohabiting couples.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas recently established the Special Committee on Gender Equality as a result of recommendations made by the citizens' assembly.  This committee is considering the recommendations contained in the report of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality together with the response of the Government to each recommendation and is due to report within nine months of its establishment.  These matters should be examined in the round by the committee and we can then consider its report in regard to specific policy contexts, including social protection schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, in order to be helpful, my Department will carry out a report on this issue and feed it into the Oireachtas committee, which is examining this in the round.  As I said, Deputy Kerrane has tabled a similar amendment that we will reach later.  I give them both a commitment that I will ask my officials to carry out a report on how cohabiting couples are treated in the social welfare system.  I will refer that report to the Oireachtas committee, which can consider it in the round.  I reiterate marriage conveys legal rights in a number of areas, particularly succession rights, that go beyond the remit of my Department.  The issue needs to be examined on a whole-of-government basis.  I understand Deputy Bacik is chairing the committee.  I will be happy to feed this information into that committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500056#KKK00600","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639591320,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639591320,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, after line 31, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Report on maternity and related benefits<\/b>  \t<b>24.<\/b>The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the adequacy of the level of payment of maternity benefit and other child-related leave benefits, and report with proposals to link these benefits to earned income.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>  <p>With each passing year, it seems the adequacy of maternity benefit and other child-related leave benefits diminish, for a range of reasons.

The new rate of payment will be &euro;250 per week.  Over time, parent's leave and benefit will increase to nine weeks for each parent, in line with the EU work-life balance directive.  This will bring paid leave in Ireland up to a combined 46 weeks for a two-parent family by 2024.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed, as part of the programme for Government, to examining pay-related benefit for people who lose their jobs.  As part of next year's budget, I intend to bring forward proposals on pay-related benefit for those who lose their job.  That will involve a major change in the social welfare system, and if we get it right, we can then examine widening it out to other benefits.  I think it is best to focus on pay-related benefits for the unemployed first, and once we have that principle, we can consider it in other areas.<\/p>  <p>  I am a strong supporter of pay-related benefit.
