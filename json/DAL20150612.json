I thank my colleagues who have turned up to form a quorum.  I really appreciate that.  I do not see the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, here this morning.  That does not surprise me but it disappoints me.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has many responsibilities, and the latest to be added to his portfolio is the drugs issue.  If they could get away with it, I would say that the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, would put something into the water that would have us all go to sleep, lie down and take our dose of the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  My Bill is effectively an effort to tame the beast of Irish Water.  There are many hundreds of good people working in Irish Water, as there were in the county councils beforehand, doing a good public service and being obliging out of hours, on weekends, etc.  They leave their families to fix breaks in supply and ensure water is in constant supply in the capital city and all the corners of Ireland.  I also salute the people involved with the group schemes, who were real pioneers in their work bringing water to communities.  The late, great Canon Hayes and others did that kind of work voluntarily, with enthusiasm and much pride.  Moving from this, we can see that somebody had a pipe dream to set up a monopoly.  \"Pipe dream\" is an appropriate phrase, but pipes explode every now and again as well.  They did not check the pipes here first and the issue became very explosive.  That pipe dream has fragmented and shattered.<\/p>  <p>  My Bill was put together last September and October and I moved it here with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle in November.  I am thankful it was drawn out of the lottery for this week.  The Government decision of 19 November 2014 was that there would be one overarching, mainly non-executive, Ervia board with responsibility and accountability for the performance of the Ervia group.  There would be two subsidiary companies of Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland.  The two subsidiaries would be subject to the control and oversight of the parent company but would have small executive boards to directly manage the business of each subsidiary.  I want to make it crystal clear that the activities of all the boards, the subsidiaries, the main board and - crucially - any future subsidiaries should be open to the transparency of freedom of information legislation.  There are only three or four main planks in the Bill and freedom of information is one of those.  It is very important.  We have seen in the past few weeks how extraordinarily difficult it is to obtain information about various banking boards and the same cannot be allowed to happen in this area.  Nevertheless, it is happening right before our eyes.  We were promised that the process would be transparent but it is not.  This must be fully subject, unequivocally, to the full and active freedom of information process.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to see the appointment of an ombudsman.  The need for a completely separate and independent water services ombudsman was starkly highlighted this week by the release of information by the current Ombudsman with respect to public services.  I did not have this information when I was putting together this Bill.  The number of complaints to the Ombudsman about public services rose by 11% to 3,500 in 2014.  When he launched his annual report last Wednesday, the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, stated that the increase was mainly due to the additional 200 public bodies that came within his jurisdiction for a full year for the first time in 2014, which is very telling.  These included bodies in the education sector, such as the State Examinations Commission and Student Universal Support Ireland.  How will the current Ombudsman deal with the inevitable flood of complaints regarding Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  I have always said that the only part of Irish Water that I welcomed was its ainm, Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  That is the only good part of it, as far as I can see.  There is nothing else.<\/p>  <p>  We need a separate ombudsman so we do not completely undermine and overload the current system.  As we can see from Wednesday's report, it is already overloaded.  Irish Water has made a mess of billing, contracting and the rest of it and we saw that unfold before our eyes all over the country.  It is a wonder it is not billing people in England and America; that is how out of kilter are the ICT systems, and those people may yet receive those bills.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of summary of advice to the Minister from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  Before Irish Water was set up, the CER recommended that the economic regulatory framework for public water services in Ireland should be put in place, as it was for the electricity and gas sectors, based on four key principles.  The ESB model should have been considered, admired and copied.  The principles are stability, predictability, sustainability and cost-efficiency but questions genuinely need to be asked in terms of stability for whom, cost-efficiency for whom and predictability for what - my God, this will make some film in years to come.  It will certainly not be for the many hundreds of thousands of households who will be trapped for repair costs.  There should be an insurance policy built into the fee.  It is fine if the cost is a bit extra but at least when there is a burst pipe in a house, there would be some fall-back for people on the bread line.  These people are not all unemployed, as they also include people with small businesses and low-income individuals.<\/p>  <p>  The CER also argued that in regulating the water sector, the commission would apply the same values as it has done in the electricity and gas sectors, namely, fair and transparent regulation, acting with integrity and respect and consulting with stakeholders.  That is instead of setting up consultant companies; the vocabulary in the dictionary was changed by the former Minister, the big man from Kilkenny who is now a European Commissioner.  I affectionately call him Big Phil Hogan, the enforcer.  The values would also include being accountable to the Oireachtas, customers and stakeholders while making informed decisions but none of that has occurred.<\/p>  <p>  This has been an absolute joke.  Over the course of the past number of years, there have been at least eight increases in the price of energy household energy bills, all under the watch of the same Commission for Energy Regulation.  It has done nothing to safeguard the interest of the household and it has been asleep at the wheel.  We have seen how other regulators were found with their you-know-whats down in the past couple of weeks in different areas.  They were asleep at the wheel but were offered big pensions.  That is disgusting in the extreme and people are sickened by it.  The Commission for Energy Regulation continues to state that in order to ensure the regulatory framework continues to be appropriate to the future needs and priorities of the sector, it proposes to adjust and refine the economic regulatory framework over time in line with the above principles.  This is the type of bureaucratic language whose only purpose is to sound firm and fair.  While leaving plenty of wiggle room for major change, it has nothing to do with what the hundreds of households deserve, desire and are entitled to as citizens of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The need for an insurance policy provision is most clearly highlighted by the ongoing revelations this week about the extent of lead piping in the water infrastructure.  I attended the weekly clinic with Deputy Cowen and others but it has become a joke.  I was promised answers.  I have been phoning and sending texts to people since 7.30 a.m. this morning but I still have no answers.  One cannot get answers from anybody.  Never mind a straight answer, we get no answer.<\/p><p>Families cannot be left with accumulated financial debt arising from exorbitant call out fees, and we saw the fees that were proposed.  Is the alternative to leave families with leaking pipes and ever-increasing bills for water?  They will be caught regardless of what way they turn.  They cannot go anywhere, be it up or down the field or up or over the road.  They will not even have water to wash themselves.  We will not know what country we are living in as we will not be able to distinguish between whether it is a foreign country or our own country.  On top of that families will then face having to find hundreds, if not thousands, of euro to have repairs carried out.  That is a fact.<br\/><br\/>I do not know where the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, the invincible, is today.  I am very disappointed that a fellow Tipperary man would not have the courtesy to come to the House to debate this Bill.  He says he does not own the situation, that he inherited it and it is all due to the Fine Gael Party and the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan.  That will not get the Minister far in Rearcross or Carrick-on-Suir because people know the truth.<br\/><br\/>Where is the clarity about the massive fees that were discussed in the past?  They are forgotten about now, but they were discussed previously and put into the public domain.  How can a call out fee such as the proposed &euro;120 an hour and charges such as &euro;170 be justified for families on social welfare?  I happen to know a little about pipes and I realise that if one were to carry out a survey of lead pipes in a house, the first and second hours would pass very quickly.  These bills would amount to far more than the cost of paying the water bill.  This is a real trick-of-the-loop job, or a case of &quot;catch me if you can&quot;.  However, when the election is held the Minister will be caught and he will have nowhere to run.  He will not be saying, &quot;catch me if you can&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I also seek clarity about the future sale, privatisation, public private partnership or whatever vehicle or wild animal the Government chooses to call it, before it flogs Irish Water as it did last week with Aer Lingus.  As sure as it will get dark tonight and bright tomorrow morning that is what will happen.  I seek a straight provision in the Bill that it will not be sold without a referendum.  The Government is able to hold referendums on plenty of matters, so it can hold one on this question quite easily.  It could have added it to the last referendum instead of the joke it had about the age for election as President.  I seek to replace words such as &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;may&quot; with the phrases &quot;will not be sold&quot; or &quot;cannot be sold&quot; in the primary legislation, nothing more or less.  It is unequivocal, straight language so people can say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, not &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;may&quot; so barristers can argue the connotations <i>ad infinitum<\/i>in the Four Courts.<br\/><br\/>The Bill has four main objectives - a referendum about the future sale of Irish Water; freedom of information, which is vital; an insurance policy in respect of breaks and the exorbitant costs that could arise given that the stopcock could be out at the road and a mile away from one's house or at the front gate, in the driveway or at the back of the house; and the provision of an ombudsman.  It is vital that an ombudsman is appointed because there will be thousands of complaints.  We already have them on our desks.  Every Deputy, Senator and councillor gets them, but there are no answers.  Irish Water inherited the entire pipe network and water sources.  One would have thought from listening to the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste that there was never a pipe in the ground and that we were living in the Sahara desert, that there was not a drop of water anywhere until Irish Water was established.  It is such an insult to the people who served this country, such as the pioneers of the group schemes and the engineering officials in all the county councils who designed the system.  I thank them for that.  It was a reasonable network.  I accept there were problems in Dublin but if people had been looking after it there would be a better supply by now instead of trying to raid the Shannon.  The years of Cromwell are gone.  One must deal with people up-front and fairly and introduce cost saving and water saving initiatives.  However, there is not one initiative in the entire system.<br\/><br\/>There is also the joke for which the Labour Party is solely responsible in its efforts to get out of the mess.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, confirmed this week that &euro;637,000 is being paid to a consultancy company to produce the information technology, IT, required to pay back the &euro;100 to families.  Has one ever heard anything to beat that?  Playschool children would not do this.  The consultancy company is BearingPoint Consulting, formerly a unit of KPMG.  It is another cosy network.  We would need a good fire hose, with more than water in the hose, to scatter that crowd and the rot of the big consultants and big business that are plundering this country before the eyes of the people.  Successive Governments have allowed this to happen.<br\/><br\/>We are going to pay &euro;637,000 for IT alone just to return the &euro;100.  Did one ever hear such B-U-L-L?  It is unbelievable.  Why could the Government not simply deduct the &euro;100 from the bill?  Children in preschool, indeed children who have not yet been born, would know that.  For God's sake, this is laughable.  The Government is paying consultants, advisers and everybody else to screw the people and take everything from them.  Another nice sum of almost &euro;1 million is gone on this.  I have also heard that union officials are demanding more staff for the Department of Social Protection to deal with this payment.  They should have nothing to do with it.  There are many good staff in the Department and they have enough to do in dealing with the many issues in social welfare without being dragged into this mess in an effort to calm the fire.  The Government could deal with it by deducting the &euro;100, but there would be no consultants involved and no more gravy trains for the boys.  One from two is one; it is quite simple.  One does not need any IT skills or mathematics graduates to do that.  It is tomfoolery of the highest order.  It is skullduggery and I could use far stronger words but I do not wish to use them in the Chamber out of respect to the Ceann Comhairle and everybody else.<br\/><br\/>It is a failure, a disaster and a wild animal.  I have called it a beast.  We have an issue with BSE today, but this is worse than animals with BSE because, as I have said previously and I hope the Ceann Comhairle will not object, it is set up corruptly.

The provision of sustainable water services is of critical importance to citizens and the economy of our country.  As Members will be aware, modernising and improving water services delivery in Ireland is a key policy objective in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>The establishment of Irish Water has been one of the most significant elements among a wide range of public sector reform measures achieved by the Government.  The move towards the utility model will deliver major benefits to our people and to our economy in a number of ways, notably through providing a more structured and co-ordinated approach to the delivery<\/p><p>of water services on a national basis; achieving economies of scale in service delivery and more efficient procurement of materials and services; reducing unacceptable levels of waste from the drinking water distribution system with an estimated 40% of treated drinking water being unaccounted for prior to the establishment of Irish Water; and reducing the overall costs of delivering water services.<\/p><p>The establishment of Irish Water within Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, which has now been renamed Ervia, was an important step in assisting the utility to leverage the existing core expertise available to Bord G&aacute;is as a modern and efficiently run utility.  Ervia and Irish Water estimate that establishing Irish Water within the BGE group has saved potentially tens of millions of euro.  In the longer term, the establishment of Irish Water will lead to a more efficient service due to economies of scale, and to a higher quality and more resilient service due to increased capacity to invest and innovate.<\/p><p>The reform of water services is not only important to delivering better value for money to our citizens but is also critical to supporting economic development and growth.  By 2030, the world is expected to need 40% more water than will be available.  We are distinct from most countries due to the level of fresh water available, a benefit we can turn to our advantage by creating a world class water sector that can attract water-intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agri-food to Ireland.  These industries already sustain well over 200,000 jobs between them.<\/p><p>This Bill aims to amend the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to provide for the following: Irish Water to be subject to freedom of information legislation; creating a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water; ensuring that Irish Water will not be transferred to private ownership or public private partnership without such ownership or partnership being put before the people via referendum; and requiring that the Minister direct Irish Water, within two years of its establishment, to provide for the provision of an insurance policy to all of its customers with respect to water leakage and damaged infrastructure.<\/p><p> A number of the proposals in this Bill have already been comprehensively dealt with through legislation introduced by the Government.  First, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, included Irish Water under FOI legislation.  The Water Services Act 2014 then included the requirement that any proposal to change the ownership status of Irish Water would first be put to the people.  Protecting the interest of customers of Irish  Water has been a high priority for the Government throughout the water reform process.  To ensure this protection, the 2014 Act provided that the Commission for Energy Regulation, which had previously been assigned the function for water regulation, was required to establish a dispute resolution process for Irish Water customers.<\/p> <p> I will now deal with the specific proposals contained in the Bill.  Irish Water is already subject to FOI legislation.  Under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2014, Irish Water is been subject to the provisions of the FOI Acts from 17 July 2013.<\/p> <p> In regard to the independent Ombudsman for Water, it was a policy decision of the Government to establish Irish Water as a public utility, and this is reflected in the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The legislative framework the Government has put in place to establish Irish Water and the CER, as the economic regulator for Irish Water, means there is a robust process for the protection of customer interests and clearly demonstrates that the customer was at the centre of Government's thinking when framing the legislation.  As can be seen from the extensive activity being undertaken by the CER, this process is operating effectively.<\/p> <p> In addition, the CER has been given a specific statutory role under the Water Services Act 2014 in regard to dispute resolution for Irish Water customers.  This will involve a similar service to that operated by the CER for the gas and electricity sectors, whereby it can investigate customer complaints that Irish Water has not resolved.  I do not believe the creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water, as suggested in this Bill, is therefore warranted.  Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has also required Irish Water to submit a customer handbook outlining the minimum customer service standards it will provide to its customers.  The customer handbook comprises Irish Water's customer charter, codes of practice and terms and conditions of supply.<\/p> <p> Along with these measures, the CER will engage with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query.  In this regard, it should be noted that Irish Water is also subject to statutory supervision by the EPA and the Health Service Executive in respect of any environmental and human health aspects of its water services provision.<\/p> <p> In regard to the ownership of Irish Water, it has been made very clear that the Government is totally opposed to the privatisation of public water services and there is no question of the service being privatised.  The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, conforming to the conditions contained in the Act and registered under the Companies Act.  The Act provides that Irish Water is registered as a private company limited by shares under the Companies Act, with one share in Irish Water issued to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, now Ervia, and the remaining shares allocated equally between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  As Ervia is a fully State-owned company, Irish Water is, accordingly, in full State ownership.  Subsequently, an amendment introduced in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 prohibits each of the three shareholders from disposing of their shareholding in Irish Water and thus places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water.<\/p> <p> To copperfasten this prohibition, the Water Services Act 2014 provides that any proposal by a future Government for legislation that would involve any change in the State's ownership of Irish Water, as outlined, would require approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently any proposal would have to be put to the people via a plebiscite before such legislation could even proceed.  Also, there is a further statutory provision which safeguards water services infrastructure in public ownership.  Section 31(12) of the Water Services Act 2007 prevents Irish Water from entering into any agreement or arrangement with another person which involves or may involve the transfer of assets and infrastructure from Irish Water to that person.<\/p> <p> In regard to an insurance policy for customers, it is not the function of Irish Water to provide any type of insurance policy for customers in terms of leaks or damaged infrastructure.  Under the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner.  This is similar to the situation with other utility services, such as gas or electricity.  The proposal in the Bill to change responsibility for internal repairs and maintenance would have significant implications from a financial perspective for Irish Water and could have wide-ranging impacts for other utility service providers.  I do not believe, therefore, that the proposal in the Bill is an appropriate approach to take on this issue.<\/p> <p> This morning's debate provides an important opportunity to remind the House of the significant progress that has been made in implementing the Government's water sector reform programme.  This programme is based on three pillars: the establishment of a national utility to provide water and waste water services on a national basis; the establishment of a sustainable funding model for water services, underpinned by domestic and non-domestic water charges and the ability of the national utility to borrow from capital markets to increase infrastructural spending, and to increase annual expenditure from approximately &euro;300 million per annum when Irish Water was established to at least &euro;600 million per annum; and the introduction of independent economic regulation of Irish Water, which has been assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation.<\/p> <p> With each new challenge in our public water system that Irish Water confronts, the underlying need for reform becomes increasingly clear and justification for reform becomes stronger.  Public water services were and remain in need of change in the way they are delivered, as does the way they are funded.  The previous system of providing water services through local authorities was not working properly, despite the best efforts of the dedicated and experienced staff involved.  Local authorities were restricted in their ability to borrow, so they could not invest adequately in the system.  The time taken to make decisions to invest was often slow, bureaucratic and inefficient.  Planning for new water services largely stopped at the county boundary, so there was limited opportunity to achieve economies of scale on a regional or national basis.<\/p> <p> We saw and continue to see the results of this fundamentally flawed approach in almost every city, town and county.  There are major issues around the quality of water supply and the capacity of the existing system to supply treated water in the quantities needed by households, business and industry.  For example, there are almost 20,123 people on boil water notices from 21 supplies, and more than 955,000 people depend on drinking water supplies that are at risk of failing the required standards.  Almost half the water treated, at significant cost, escapes through leaks and is unaccounted for.  For example, Irish Water was able to establish that 22 households were leaking over 1 million litres a day into their driveways.  That is enough to serve the daily needs of the town of Gorey.<\/p> <p> There are 44 towns where largely untreated sewage is running into our rivers and seas, including popular seaside towns such as Cobh, Youghal and Bundoran.  This cannot be allowed to continue or it will be hugely damaging to our vital tourism sector.  In Dublin, more than 800 km of piping is over 100 years old.  There is an insufficient water supply for the greater Dublin area.  Earlier this year, Irish Water published a project need report, which identified that projected demand for water in Dublin alone is expected to increase by over 50% by 2050.  This is far beyond the capacity of the existing sources which serve the region.<\/p> <p> Nationally, our population is increasing, our economy is growing and our climate is changing.  These realities bring new demands and challenges for our water system, the reality that a single national utility is best equipped to manage.  By 2030, our river basin management plans will have been reviewed a further three times and the quality of our water bodies will have to be improved.  Our rivers, lakes and other water bodies need greater protection, not just for the protection of public health and our natural environment, but to ensure that our thriving tourism industry can continue to prosper under the banner of Ireland's image as a clean, green country.<\/p> <p> The three pillars of reform - a national utility, a new sustainable finding model and the introduction of independent economic regulation - have been implemented and are leading to major changes in how we plan and deliver water infrastructure and services.  Irish Water has introduced fundamental reforms to the planning and delivery of water services.  It has adopted a new approach to asset management, for example, which has resulted in a significant change of approach to infrastructural delivery.  Central strategic planning is now based on accurate asset performance data and full control of all investment decisions.  The utility is now planning investment consistently across the asset base rather than large-scale, one-off investments.  An example of this is the proposed Ringsend waste water treatment plant upgrade, where an alternative approach to a treatment plant extension will save the company &euro;170 million in capital investment.  The utility has also standardised certain operational procedures, leading to benefits in performance and energy costs.  It is conducting plant and process audits, which are identifying repair needs, assisting in planned maintenance programmes and providing for efficiency scoping.  It has introduced utility systems to manage spend, improve value for money and capture the condition and performance of water services infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Under the service level agreements, annual plans and the 2014-2017 transformation plan, Irish Water has begun implementing other initiatives that will standardise and modernise operations, asset management, customer service, procurement improvement, and assets data intelligence.  Examples of this are the hand-held devices that council staff will be given so that they can be given work orders quickly to fix water problems and report back when they are completed, and the single national laboratory service for testing water samples.  The greater economies of scale which are possible through having one national utility rather than 31 separate local authorities have resulted in &euro;12 million in procurement savings in the company's first year alone.<\/p><p>In the area of electricity supply, a major cost in the production of water, Irish Water's current renewable and efficient energy initiatives aim to reduce costs by 33% by 2020.<br\/><br\/>In April 2014, Irish Water became the main contact point for customer queries and reports regarding water supply outages and water quality through its customer call centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200004#B01600","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434101400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>One cannot get through to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200006#D00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1434101400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>This development was another milestone along the road to achieving a single, standardised national service throughout the country, with a greater focus on those who use the public services.<\/p>  <p>  Such progress would not have been possible without strong co-operation between Irish Water and local authorities, which have decades of experience of providing water and wastewater services with great care and dedication.  The 12 year service level agreements, now almost a year in existence, have proven to be a strong partnership between the local authorities' expertise in operations and the considerable network and utility management experience within the Ervia Group.  This was most evident during Storm Darwin in February last year, when the two parties collaborated effectively to address emergency situations and maintain clear lines of communication with each other and with the public during a time of pressure on the public water system.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the roll-out of the metering programme has been particularly impressive.

This involves identifying customer side leakage between the meter box and the point of entry into the house, offering repairs of these leaks to customers.

I compliment Deputy McGrath on bringing it forward.  While we would not agree with everything contained in it, we support the spirit and intention of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's lengthy script, which was distributed, refers to the three pillars of reform and the success in setting up the national utility.  I would not consider the setting up of Irish Water a success.  In terms of a sustainable funding model, I ask the Minister to examine its operational funding for this year and the sources, capital investment and voodoo economics being performed in regard to the write-off of rates, the so-called water conservation grant, for which one does not have to save a drop of water, and the transfer of &euro;500 million, with the stroke of a pen in December, back onto the State's balance sheet in a water debt, which is the exact opposite of the Government's stated intention in respect of Irish Water.  All of those costs were to be removed from the balance sheet but they are accumulating.  Those are not my sums; they are the Minister's.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water must be abolished and replaced with a public company that is fit for purpose.  I have stated that many times.  Some commentators have been slow to pick up on that but they can read it in the Official Report, particularly for 4 December when I outlined our position regarding the need to dismantle Irish Water.  We will support the passing of the Bill at this Stage to allow it go to committee where we believe it should be amended.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, certain groups are claiming that Sinn F&eacute;in holds a different position from what I have outlined, despite the fact that I am on record on many occasions in the House calling for Irish Water to be replaced.  In April, our party also published a water services repeal Bill that would have legislated to abolish both domestic water charges and Irish Water but it was not allowed come before the House because there was a funding implication.  We provided for that in our budget submission last year.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the substance of the Bill, the main focus this week has been on the issue of not being able to obtain information from Irish Water under the Freedom of Information Act.  Deputy McGrath's Bill calls for the company to be made fully subject to freedom of information, FOI, legislation.  I am aware the Bill was drafted prior to that provision being inserted but it does not fully comply with that.  All of us have had difficulty getting information from Irish Water.  I tabled a priority question to the Minister in another attempt to get further information on the number of bills sent out and the number that have been paid, and that was ruled out of order.  There is a big wall between us and information.  I recall addressing the former Minister, Phil Hogan, on that issue several times because he continued to say Irish Water would be a stand-alone semi-State company.  I know what that means, as does the Minister and everybody in this House.  It means it does not have to disclose certain information.  I predicted that would happen, and it has happened.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear there is a reluctance on the part of the Government to have Irish Water provide such information.  Members of this House should know the number of bills that have been sent out and the number that have been paid.  That would strongly indicate that the number of people who have not paid is far higher than the Government or Irish Water would like people to believe.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy McGrath's proposal, the Freedom of Information Act does apply now to Irish Water.  However, there are problems and I request that the Minister ensure that the company is complying fully with its statutory obligation to supply information under FOI requests that have been submitted to it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath wants a referendum to be held before Irish Water could be sold off but Sinn F&eacute;in is stating that inserting a clause in the Constitution allowing the public to do that so as to protect Irish Water from being sold off is the best way to proceed.  The Government has put that in legislation.  The Minister said, and I accept it, that at this point he would not like to see Irish Water being sold off.  Some might question that because of what the Government is doing with Aer Lingus.  We will accept that is the case but in terms of future governments, who will be here in ten years time, with all the new parties?  We could have brand nua, a right wing coalition of God knows what concoction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200006#D00700","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1434101400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Uisce imithe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200006#D00800","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1434101400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>They could do that, and that is the fear.  I say that genuinely to the Minister.  Our Bill proposing a referendum to insert a clause in the Constitution would firmly place the ownership of the water resources and water services in the hands of the people.  The Minister's approach just to use legislation is weak.<\/p>  <p>  The reason water services throughout the world were in public hands has nothing to do with ideology; it is just hard facts.  First, governments recognised that water was important.  Second, when the system of public water supply to houses was established, private companies throughout the world were not interested but they are starting to become interested now because these services and infrastructure have been built up over many years.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the operation of Irish Water, recent reports on the continuing level of leaks and the number of lead pipes proves that rehabilitation of the system is not taking place.  The Minister is correct that priority is not being given to the meters.  They are being put in at a huge rate, but they are being put into a leaking system.  If we accept the Minister's statement that 6% of the water produced is lost on the domestic side of the meter, that means 3% is leaking from the other side of the meter.  However, 50% is leaking out of the total system, with 47% leaking out of the public infrastructure, as the Minister has clarified.<\/p><p>There is another problem concerning insurance.  I raised a case in Portlaoise with the Minister in this House.  A contractor fitted meters in a housing estate.  One inhabitant, a widow, was away at the time.  She came back after a few days to find that the meter had been fitted and turned back on.  I raised this with engineers.  One needs to wind the old stopcocks several times to turn them on and off, but with the new meters one just does a half turn and the water goes on full force.  The contractor turned the water back on, blew the middle out of the filter in the water softener in the utility room and destroyed the utilities in the room and the entire house.  I tried to get a resolution for that widow but failed because it has bounced back and forth between the contractor and Irish Water and we have hit a brick wall.  There is no protection.  The actions of contractors are causing problems for householders.  I visited that woman's house twice.  A councillor brought it to my attention.  I am very disappointed to say that this unfortunate woman received no resolution and has been left to carry the can for thousands of euro worth of damage.<\/p> <p> In respect of the proposal for a dedicated ombudsman, our party's proposal about maintaining water services in public hands and having a proper public body that would be accountable to the Oireachtas would negate the need for an ombudsman.  The Minister of State has highlighted the CER but the Government brushed it to one side.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government drove a bulldozer over it last October or November.  The CER might as well not exist.  To quote Mao Zedong, the CER is a paper tiger.  Anybody who looked at the Government's actions last autumn would have seen that it basically steamrollered over the CER, so it is an ineffectual paper tiger that is useless at this stage.  The people working in it might be well intentioned but they have been rendered obsolete.  If water services were constitutionally protected, Irish Water was abolished and there was a proper public body that was accountable to the Oireachtas, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister, it would solve that problem.  <\/p> <p> We will support the passage of the Bill to the next Stage.  We are doing so on the basis that there are aspects of it that could be addressed in other ways, some of which I have outlined.  It does at least address major issues.  We need to look again at water services.  The Deputy has done us a service in bringing it up at this point and introducing the Bill.  I know the Minister of State only got halfway through his script.  It was one of those long scripts that Chinese leaders would be handed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200006#D00900","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434102000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Deputy must conclude as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200007#E00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1434102000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said it would be cheaper.

I know things have moved on and there have been changes over the past number of months, but it is a very clear and sensible piece of legislation that tries to deal with Irish Water and its responsibility to the people of this country.  This is the important thing, even though we have moved a bit over the past three months.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of water services and water charges is a disgrace.  The Government's handling of it, the consultants and the lack of accountability over the past number of months are appalling from a Government that promised change, reform, openness and accountability.  Many people are asking what is going on here.  Even this week, we have seen the Taoiseach refusing to answer questions in this House about Irish Water, the number of people who have been paid and who is paying.  I do not think it is good enough or that it is transparent or accountable.  <\/p>  <p>  I commend the Deputy on his great work on the Bill.  There are three key points in the legislation.  It is primarily an attempt to rein in the ability of Irish Water to further mire hundreds of thousands of households in repair-related debt, which could run into multiples of the annual water charge.  It also contains a provision for the establishment of the independent water ombudsman and the retention of the State water infrastructure in public hands, which I strongly support.  It deals with the issue of full transparency and accountability in respect of Irish Water under the freedom of information legislation.  I accept that this has moved on since then.  Despite these efforts, Ministers are still not answering questions, which is appalling.  It is also very upsetting for taxpayers.  <\/p>  <p>  Another issue that arisen in recent days is that of lead in pipes and public safety.  More than 200,000 houses could have lead pipes.  People in St. Anne's in Raheny, Marino, Artane and Coolock in my own constituency of Dublin Bay North have contacted my office about this issue and are very concerned.  They are being asked to pay for water, but at the same time they find out that they must fix the water pipes themselves.  I believe some small grant could made available for some people, but it will be means-tested.  The vast majority of people will be hammered again.  Some people are talking about extra costs to a family of around &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  This is once again an example of people on the ground being hammered by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of cost is important, but the major issue for me is public health.  The Minister of State said earlier on that there would be a campaign relating to this, but we need more than a campaign to deal with this issue.  Lead in pipes is a serious public health issue.  It can increase the number of children born with disabilities.  We must focus on this issue.  We have seen the reaction to the BSE finding over the past 12 hours.  We all hope that works out well because, regardless of politics, we all want to see our agricultural sector flourish and develop.  Lead in pipes needs to be tackled head-on.  There is no point in coming out with statements and woolly campaigns.  They are not enough.  There is a major potential health crisis and we need to focus on this issue.  The Minister and Irish Water need to wake up, smell the coffee and deal with the issue.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that 20,123 people were on \"boil water\" notices from 21 supplies.  More than 955,000 people depend on drinking water supplies that are at risk of not meeting the required standards.  This poses a major risk.  What has the Government been doing over the past 12 months?  We have heard about leaks and lead in pipes and we now see people with \"boil water\" notices.  The Government should fix the leaks and sort the water as well.  <\/p>  <p>  I think there are in the region of 800 km to 900 km of pipes in Dublin city that are over 100 years old.  Another issue that has been left out of this debate is the environment.  Lough Derg is a beautiful lake in County Tipperary that is visited by many tourists.  I know the Minister of State knows the area around Dromineer and places like that well.  There are major concerns about Irish Water proposing to take water from the lake.  There are concerns that the water levels could be lowered, with effects on fishing, tourism and revenue.<\/p><p>This is related not only to Irish Water but also the broader debate about what is happening in this country.  We have a long way to go before we have competent planning and quality services.<\/p> <p> The relationship between water charges and what has been happening in society over the last four years is also relevant to this debate.  I refer in particular to austerity.  I do not accept the way in which certain EU member states are bullying other countries on the issue of debt.  The IBRC debate earlier this week revealed that certain people had their debts written off while regular mortgage holders got screwed, received nasty letters or had their houses sold.  The Government needs to change its attitude and the EU should stop bullying small countries like Greece.  Greece was not destroyed by Syriza.  Successive centre-right Governments were to blame for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200007#E00400","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434102600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to stick to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200008#F00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1434102600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>It is related to Irish Water.

It is important that we continue to debate this issue because it is being raised on doorsteps across this country.  From its very inception, Irish Water was regarded as a toxic entity by the citizens of this State.  Such was the opposition that huge numbers people took to the streets to protest it.  These thousands and thousands of people finally forced the Government to backtrack on its plans for Irish Water.  Fianna F&aacute;il reached agreement with the troika to privatise water services and commodity water, and the current Government continued that policy.  It is amazing that the Labour Party continues to support Irish Water.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was opposed to water service charges while he was in Opposition, as were many of his party colleagues.  When Deputy Eric Byrne stood in the 2000 general election he issued a leaflet which stated:<blockquote>A number of issues will emerge in the forthcoming general election: massive job redundancies, poor state of our health and education systems, traffic congestion, and lack of proper childcare. <br \/><br \/>Service charges will also be an issue. Be warned: the same politicians who brought you rubbish charges are planning to introduce new water and other service charges in the future.<br \/><br \/>You should ask all canvassers: - Do you support services charges?<br \/><br \/>- Do you support jailing people who do not pay service charges?<\/blockquote>The same Deputy voted for Irish Water, which has commodified a crucial human requirement.  It is an absolute scandal and the Labour Party should be ashamed of itself.<\/p><p>We know what happens when utilities are commodified.  Deputy Eric Byrne and I opposed bin charges because we knew that once waste collection was commodified it would become attractive to corporations around Europe and the world.  Water is the new oil.  From Dublin to Detroit and from Bray to Bolivia, people are demanding that their water remain in public ownership.  Some people have made the outrageous claim that we never paid for water.  We always paid for our water through VAT and motor tax.  Local authorities received &euro;1.2 billion every year to manage our water supply.  Questions about how that money was used could have been addressed by bringing the water service departments in local authorities together as a national grouping.  I raised the issue of water supplies and repairs of leaks on numerous occasions while I was on Dublin City Council.  We were told there was no problem with making money available but that the tendering process was cumbersome and lengthy and once the tender was complete it took even more time before the workers were actually fixing the pipes.  The Government should have addressed those issues instead of establishing the toxic entity that is Irish Water.<\/p><p>The Government claims that water meter installation is proceeding well.  That is not the case in the many areas which have resisted water meters.  In Donegal, the companies which were given the contract for installing meters subsequently pulled out because they feel they cannot complete this work.  There was huge resistance in working-class areas of Dublin city because people see water meters as the next step towards privatisation.  I worked with the community in my own area in Parnell Road, Crumlin, when residents objected to water meters.  We were arrested in an over-the-top response to our protests.  Peaceful protests should be respected by Irish Water, the Garda and the State.  Arresting people is not the proper way to respond because it causes friction in the community and risks undermining the good work that community garda&iacute; have done.<\/p><p>The progressive work that the Government claims is being done by Irish Water, such as dealing with boil water notices, could easily have been carried out by the local authorities if a coherent strategy had been developed on a national basis.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is aware of the quality of the work done by those who worked in the water departments of our local authority.  They knew every part of our city.  The Government claims it only recently realised that we have problems with lead pipes, but we knew for decades that any house older than 70 years could contain lead piping.  Members on the Government benches had the opportunity to deal with that issue while they were in the local authority but they failed to do so, even though the problems were repeatedly brought to their attention by local authority engineers.<\/p><p>At the end of the day, I support the Bill over the issue of privatisation.  I do not think the Government can stand over the legislation it introduced.  Aer Lingus was a State-owned company until Fianna F&aacute;il sold 75% of it a number of years ago and this Government is about to sell off the last 25% of it.  It is not possible to know how that will impact on our strategic need for access to and from this country.  The Government should be ashamed of doing that.<\/p> <p> In all this, the TTIP is looming in the background.  On Wednesday, the votes were stopped and did not continue.  I am sure it will come back on the agenda again.  We know what TTIP is - a secret deal that is now being debated in the European Parliament.  It allows big multinational companies to hold governments to account if they introduce anything that would affect their profits.  It is a very dangerous trade agreement.  It also has a private court to determine whether these big multinationals are right regarding taking governments to court or holding them to account.  It is very dangerous and it should be debated in the D&aacute;il, as we have not had a chance to do so.  It has been discussed at a committee but we should have a debate in the Chamber to hear the Government's stance and whether it will oppose it.<\/p> <p> Tomorrow, there will be a meeting of the Right2 Water campaign to discuss policy for the next general election, including the possibility of standing candidates in every constituency it can.  We will discuss policies on the right to health, the right to education, the right to transport, the right to a democratic accountable government, the right to water and other issues.  Coming out of that I hope we will have a strong cohesive alternative to put to the people.  Yesterday, on behalf of the five unions involved, Mr. Michael Taft issued a new fiscal framework for progressive government after the next election.  This pointed out where &euro;10 billion could be found to put back into the economy and reverse the cuts in social protection and the other areas that have affected working people most.<\/p> <p> I support the Bill.  The new legislation was only introduced because of people power and people on the street.  A couple living on the north side of Dublin recently received a bill from Irish Water.  It was for &euro;64.40, the capped amount.  However, it also mentioned that the metered amount would have been &euro;476.  That is the amount the couple would be expected to pay if metering was being used at the moment.  That comes to &euro;1,900 a year.  People are absolutely gobsmacked at that and it is why people are protesting.  They see the capping until 2018 as just trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and keep them moving back.  However, people will be back out on the streets in the near future and we will be putting up candidates in the general election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200008#F00400","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434103200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the broad principles behind the Bill.

The Government will struggle to raise funds from the new charges and will not invest an extra cent than was had been invested on an annual basis by previous Administrations.<\/p>  <p>  We do not know the net income relating to that revenue because we have not been given a breakdown of the detail of the administration associated with the &euro;100 grant, as it is called, for turning on the tap.  All the while, &euro;540 million has been wasted on water meters that will not be used.  In addition, we have had &euro;172 million wasted on setting up Irish Water, particularly the &euro;85 million on consultants.  The accountancy trick of taking Irish Water off the national balance sheet has backfired badly.  It is time to suspend water charges and abolish Irish Water.  It is never too late to do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before the House today contains three key points.  In the time allocated to me, I want to deal in particular with the first one.  Since it was set up, one item has been rectified, which is the inclusion of Irish Water under the remit of freedom of information legislation.  We acknowledge that, although the Government made that change at great pain and was dragged kicking and screaming into doing so.  The initial configuration of Irish Water did not allow for it and it seems to provide still a mechanism by which information does not flow freely from this body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200009#G00200","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1434103200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200009#G00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1434103200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>This is a trait that has emerged from the Government over a period of time and the public are beginning to realise it - we certainly have.  There have been three major issues in the lifetime of the Government which demonstrated procrastination on the part of the Government in withholding information.  I and other spokespersons tabled many parliamentary questions at the time of the setting up of Irish Water.  We were met by the downright refusal of the relevant Department to answer questions pertaining to the costs associated with its set-up.  It took a slip of the tongue on the part of the CEO on a radio programme to eventually expose the massive waste of expenditure on consultants even though we had been assured that the relevant expertise to set up this entity was available within the resources of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in an effort to secure the contract ahead of Bord na M&oacute;na, its main competitor at that time.<\/p>  <p>  The former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, withheld information that was eventually exposed and led to what has ensued.  In recent times, Deputy Catherine Murphy tabled 19 questions to the Minister for Finance over the purchase of Siteserv.  That has led to considerable difficulties on the part of the Government, eventually leading it to put in place a commission of inquiry to investigate all aspects of that deal in order to assure the public, if it eventually does, that there was nothing untoward in that process.  However, it could have been avoided.  The public could have been made fully aware if the Minister had answered the relevant questions.  It took 19 questions and he eventually complimented the Deputy on getting the information through freedom of information requests.<\/p>  <p>  As recently as two days ago, the Minister who took Leaders' Questions on Wednesday would not answer questions on the amount of bills had been paid and what figures emanated from that process heretofore.  That is just not on.  Nothing has been learned.  It is a trait that has evolved and has not only become very obvious to us in here who have seen it from day one, but the public have caught on.  The public will hold the Government to account when they are asked for their verdict on its performance in government and in disseminating information.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the establishment of the weekly clinic, which I attended this week.  I did so because of the Minister's public statement on the lead pipes.  I raised that issue in the House over two years ago when there was much fanfare over Irish Water having a first-fix policy and that no expense would be spared in order for people to rectify issues surrounding the provision of water to their homes.<\/p>  <p>  I knew the extent of lead piping in the country.<\/p><p>I knew that rectifying the issue would incur a great cost on the taxpayer.  We heard nothing until this week, when we were told that 200,000 households were affected and that a grant system would be put in place for them.  On Wednesday, I asked a senior official at Irish Water what methodology had been used to arrive at that figure.  He could not tell me because he did not know.  It was a guess.  The Minister went unchecked in this regard on national television.  He tried to claim that the metering system and its installation had provided this information.  The senior official told me that metering and the 200,000 figure bore no correlation.  They were not connected at all.  The official also confirmed that there could be many more such households, as the streetscapes in towns, villages and cities had not been taken into consideration.  Nor is there a breakdown of pre-1962 planning permissions or the various changes made to regulations and planning legislation on water infrastructure since.  If there are 200,000 households, the cost will be &euro;1 billion at &euro;5,000 per household.  I estimate that there are 400,000 households, costing &euro;2 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200009#G00400","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434103800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Or 500,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200010#H00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1434103800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Minister claims that he will announce a scheme and the costs associated with it, that the grant system will come into play next January and that he will tell everyone all about it in the next few weeks, but he does not even know how many households there are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200010#H00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1434103800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>He is bluffing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200010#H00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1434103800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>When I told the senior official that this showed another example of there having been no proper preparation by anyone concerned with the debacle that is the Irish Water construct since the get-go, I was told that I was political and should not have said anything of the sort.

The issue of Irish Water and the unjust water tax has not gone away, nor will it.  As much as the Government would like to sweep its failures and those of Irish Water under the carpet, the people are not going to let that happen, and there are failures.  The Government has come under significant public pressure on the issue of water charges.  It has been forced to introduce the proposed lower rates, which is not something that it wanted to do but about which it had no choice.  The protests keep on coming.  This is all because the situation reverts back to one basic right, namely, the human right of free access to the provision of clean, fresh water and an adequate sewerage system.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, the Bill allows us to debate this issue yet again and to give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of families that the Government so desperately tries to ignore.  Election time will come, though, and ignoring the people will no longer be possible.  We have heard a great deal of talk about democratic revolution, but there has been no such revolution in the D&aacute;il.  The democratic revolution is on the streets and at the ballot box by ordinary people who say that enough is enough.  The continuing trends in the polls show this.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the need for the issues in this Bill to be debated.  Therefore, we believe that it should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage.  The Bill has a number of points of merit although, obviously, some of them are now outdated, given the fact that it has been on the Order Paper for a while.<\/p>  <p>  First, there is no question but that the board of Irish Water, as a body that attracts so much public attention, should be subject to freedom of information requests.  If the Government is stubborn enough to continue supporting the existence of Irish Water, the least it can do is afford the citizens of this State the courtesy of ensuring that the activities of the board are carried out in an open and transparent manner.  I am glad that such requests can now be lodged.<\/p><p>In regard to the establishment of a fully independent water services ombudsman to deal with the performance and operations of Irish Water, it goes without saying that he or she would be a busy ombudsman.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for Irish Water to come within the remit of the public service Ombudsman.  We believe that this office is best placed to deal with such complaints and issues that arise.  <\/p> <p> Although Sinn F&eacute;in supports the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage, I support the comments made earlier by my colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley.  Our party position is clear.  In government, we would abolish Irish Water and scrap the water charges.  The Bill before the House today provides that Irish Water be held in public ownership and be only transferred to private ownership or public-private partnership via a referendum.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes this commitment needs to be stronger.  There must be a referendum to enshrine public ownership of water into the Constitution.  The right to water and for that service to be protected deserves constitutional protection.<\/p> <p> I note the proposed provision in this Bill relating to an insurance policy.  Citizens have been turned into consumers by this Government.  Therefore, the Government and Irish Water should have the courtesy of affording them the rights afforded to consumers.  If this were the case, Irish Water should be responsible for the repair of leaks and the replacement of damaged infrastructure.  I do not believe there is a need for an insurance-type system.  What this farce has already cost the taxpayer to date is truly shocking.  The spend on fixing leaks and replacing old pipes was measly compared to the amount wasted on the Irish Water call centre, consultants and other costs.  An additional &euro;539 million was also wasted on meters that are now redundant.  The total amount wasted to date is approximately &euro;800 million.  Only &euro;40 million was spent in each of the past four years on leaks and replacing pipes.  Proper use of that &euro;800 million would ensure double the mains replacement programme for 16 years.  Imagine the difference that would make to water conservation.<\/p> <p> The Government needs to lead, to stop offering snivelling excuses and drop the line that it is all the fault of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It can start by allowing this Bill to pass Second Stage and, thus, allow proper, in-depth debate on Committee Stage.  As I said earlier, although Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the passage of this legislation to Committee Stage, this does not take away from the fact that the whole concept of the imposition of household water charges is wrong and that the privatisation of public utilities, such as water, is even more so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200010#H02000","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434104400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>There are a group of young people in the Visitors Gallery today whom, I would wager, know more about water conservation than do many Deputies in this Chamber.

The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, requires Irish Water to produce a customer handbook outlining the minimum requirement for customer service standards it will provide to its customers.  The Water Services Act 2014 makes statutory provision for the investigation by the CER of customer complaints not resolved by Irish Water.  This will be similar to the service operated by the commission in the gas and electricity markets.  In addition, the CER will engage with Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency on the development of complementary complaints processes to ensure that customers with complaints or queries are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation.

I thank all Members who have contributed to this debate.  As I outlined earlier, the Government cannot support the Bill tabled by Deputy McGrath.  Although I appreciate the sentiment behind the Bill, as I have already stated, the legislative and policy framework put in place by this Government, in particular the Water Services Act 2014, provides for what is proposed in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>The Government is in favour of measures that lead to increased transparency in relation to public administration generally and as such Irish Water has been subject to freedom of information legislation since 17 July 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation has been given the role of independent economic regulator for Irish Water and its primary statutory purpose is to ensure the protection of customers' interests.  This role is underpinned in statute.  Section 39(1) of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that the commission shall perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water.<\/p><p> The CER has also been assigned a specific statutory role under the Water Services Act 2014 in respect of resolving disputes that may arise between Irish Water and its customers.  This will involve a similar service to that operated by the Commission for Energy Regulation for the gas and electricity sectors, with the CER investigating customer complaints which Irish Water has not resolved.  The creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water, as suggested in this Bill, is, therefore, a duplication of effort and expense.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the suggestion that the establishment of Irish Water could be a precursor to privatisation.  This issue has been raised before and it has been shown to be without foundation.  The Government has made it clear that Irish Water will remain in public ownership.  In fact, this is laid down in statute in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and the Water Services Act 2014.  Any change in the State's ownership of Irish Water would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and, subsequently, any proposal would have to be put to the people via a plebiscite before it could proceed.<\/p> <p> A final proposal relating to insurance is contained in this Bill.  Irish Water is not statutorily required to provide any type of insurance policy for customers in terms of leaks or damaged infrastructure.  Responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner, as set out in the Water Services Act 2007.  This approach is similar to the position in respect of other utility services such as gas or electricity.  Changing the legal responsibility for internal repairs and maintenance would have significant implications from a financial perspective for Irish Water and could have wide-ranging impacts for other utility service providers.  Therefore, I cannot agree with the proposal on this issue.<\/p> <p> The Government is confident that the strategic national approach Irish Water has taken to all aspects of water services provision in Ireland will deliver benefits for the customer.  It is evident that Irish Water has many challenges to confront and resolve.  This will be done with the aim of providing a world-class service to the customer and this remains at the centre of the Government's reform programme.  As has been clearly outlined today, the Government has already put in place the measures required to address the objectives of this Bill in a comprehensive manner.  On that basis the Government is opposing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200011#J01000","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434105000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that neither the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, are in the House.  They are the two Ministers who debated the matter after taking over from the former Minister, Mr. Hogan.  They could have turned up today but would not turn up.  I am disappointed to have the Bill rejected out of hand.  I am not saying the Bill is perfect or that there are things in the Bill that did not get moved on.  The Bill was drafted last September.  We have a lottery system and that is why the Government has half-baked freedom of information provisions.  As we found out this week, it is not a fully fit-for-purpose vehicle.  People cannot get the information.<\/p>  <p>  I, too, wish to issue a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to na dalta&iacute; in the Gallery.  I welcome the young people and the old people as well on their visit to the House today.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, my Bill was put together with my own resources, some of my staff and some help from the Bill's office.  It was a humble effort at trying to rein in the beast of Irish Water.  That is what it has become; it is nothing short of a bad nasty beast.  It was an attempt to rein in the ability of Irish Water to further mire hundreds of thousands of households in repair-related debt, which could run into multiples of the annual charge.  Figures of &euro;120 per hour and &euro;170 per hour have been mentioned.  We have heard so much about the Government's free first fix.  When the original Bill was being debated the first fix was going to be free.  Where has that gone now?  No one trusts a word the Government has said on the matter.  No one has any faith in Irish Water anymore.  I am not attacking the staff in there, but no one trusts the organisation.  It is the wrong model.  It was set up with a contrived effort involving vast amounts of wasted money.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the 2007 Act and the various powers of the CER.  We have seen how the Commission for Energy Regulation has been a dismal failure with the ESB, gas and control of prices.  What faith can we have in that organisation or that it will be able to control the prices of Irish Water?  No one is looking at the costs to private business, including farmers, shopkeepers, hairdressers, publicans or those running funeral parlours or beauty salons and all kinds of shops.  They are going to be left carrying the can because, as Deputy Cowen said earlier, Irish Water cannot tell us anything, either through the Minister, the Taoiseach or when its representatives come to the House for their clinics.  That is a waste of time.  They come to the audio-visual room every Wednesday but cannot tell us how many people got bills or how many have paid bills.  They cannot tell us anything.  We ask questions but they say we are asking political questions.  They must be forgetting that Leinster House is at the top of the line and is a political house, elected by the people.  Their visit to the House every Wednesday is a charade.  They book up the room, which is very busy, while we have to wait eight weeks to book it.  It is nonsense.  It is booked under the name of the Minister, Deputy Kelly.  They do not even have the courage to book it under their name.  When we were here first they came but did not tell us that they were here.  They did not even notify us that they were here.  That is the charade under way.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that the CER was robust enough to deal with disputes and that there would be no need for an ombudsman.  It is not robust enough to deal with disputes.  It has enough to do.  As I said, the Ombudsman saw a 15% increase in his workload last year before ever Irish Water came around.  Irish Water will have tens of thousands of complaints because people are getting wrong bills, double bills and wrongly addressed bills: confusion reigns.  It is simply farcical.  The company is going to get bigger and bigger.  In time the Government will have to set up an ombudsman to deal with Irish Water, or else scrap it.  We should put down the beast humanely.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State also referred to ownership and the Water Services Act.  He said it was a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and that there were shares that could not be sold or disposed of.  That is hollow coming from the Minister of State who voted last week, not ten days ago, to sell off the final 25% stake of Aer Lingus.  It has no credibility.  What about all the robust proposals in the Water Services Act 2013?  It is simply not credible.  The public knows that and everyone knows that.  The Government can say what it likes but no one believes it, and no one believes the Minister of State either.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State also referred to the cost of repairs and that he could not look at any such scheme, in spite of the promise about the first fix during the debate on the original Bill under his predecessor.  There was a first-fix-free policy.  Now, the Government is saying it cannot entertain that because it would cost too much and would bring an incredible cost on Irish Water.  Those in Irish Water do not want any costs; they want all the cream but they do not want any of the sour milk.  That is what I see.  They want everything their way and they want to screw the people for what they can get off them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that the other utilities would look for the same.  The other utilities were set up time out of mind.  The ESB has a proud legacy because of what it has delivered in this country.  It was able to send people over to England and other countries during storms to help out.  They will come out within an hour to fix a leak or if something bursts.  Irish Water has inherited and taken over all the sewer systems but it is refusing point-blank to allow the county councils to enter any property which it maintains is quasi-public.  This is the case even though the pipes were built and laid by county council workers when they were building houses or taking in charge private schemes.  A public pipe running through property with a way-leave for the county council has now been transferred to Irish Water, yet Irish Water will not replace it.  Only one such job has been done in my county.  In fact, it is being done this morning at 4 Queen Street, Clonmel.  I know of others in Ard na Greine, Barron Park and all over Clonmel as well as the rest of the constituency that will not be touched.  This is being done because of the intervention of the mighty man himself, the Minister, who could not be here today.  He is probably opening a telephone box in Rearcross but he does not have the respect to come to the House.  He goes down to Bansha to announce a bus shelter and then he goes somewhere else.  He went to the workers in South Tipperary General Hospital last week.  He promised to do something for them four years ago but he did zilch for them.<\/p>  <p>  He intervened the other day.  He visited a house.  Then he contacted the county council and got all of them to get up there with machinery and a private company to free the drains at 4 Queen Street, Clonmel.  If that is not bully-boy tactics and interference I do not know what is.  He should clarify the issue once and for all.  Irish Water should be made to take on its responsibility to free these sewers, just as the county council was willing, ready and able to do previously.  Now, the council workers are put in the invidious situation whereby they cannot do it anymore.  There are tears.  Elderly people have noxious fumes in their houses and back yards.  We saw what can happen with sewer fumes this week and we sympathise with the families of those workers.<\/p>  <p>  This Minister wants to pick and choose.  He wants to say that he inherited this from the former Minister, big Phil, who is now the Commissioner.  He is adding to his pension scheme in Europe but he left a mess behind him.  I thank the other Deputies for their support and suggestions.  As they said, the Government will not get away with this.  Some time soon either this Government or the next Government will realise that this is a failed entity.  The Government will have simply to abandon it or sail it out on a ship somewhere and let it sink.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the river basin plan.  No river basin committees have even been set up since they were amalgamated and since the Government disposed of local democracy.  The Government simply banished it.<\/p><p>That is another downright misleading statement.  The Minister of State also referred to the quality customer service line for which the Government pays, but it is the customer who pays to get through and listen to an answering machine, get no answers and wait on the phone for hours.  That is some quality service.  It is a con job of the highest order.  When the customer phones the customer service line, he or she pays for it and that is supposed to be quality customer service.  My goodness, the Government must think people are right fools altogether.  The Minister of State keeps coming back, insultingly, to the fact that we were a desert, a barren land without water infrastructure, that we had nothing.  He keeps repeating the stupid remark that the water stopped at county boundaries, as if the pipes had stop-cocks, which was never the case.  If that were the case, we would not have a drop of water in this House as the water comes in from Poulaphouca and other places in County Wicklow.  It is downright balderdash that would not be put through by a kindergarten but the Government thinks it can do it due to its spin doctors.<\/p> <p> There is also the falsity of what was said about saving &euro;80 million on the project at Ringsend.  The Minister of State should tell the truth.  The Government has not changed it.  It is a different project to the one that was designed, planned and costed.  That is downright deceitful.  Does the Government think people are fools altogether?  The consultants put this story into cosy talk and put a cosy spin on it and think people will believe it.  Live horse and one will get grass.  The Government wants to feed us all with some kind of manna.  Last week I spoke about the lead in the pipes.  It would be more important to take out the fluoride.  The Government would put something else in the pipes if it could to put us all into a soft coma so that we might think the Government is worth re-electing, that it is a stable Government that has turned the economy around.  Enda the almighty.  Alan the great man.  Alan the messiah from Tipperary with his chest out - John F. Kennedy.  His legacy will be an Irish water system that is fit for purpose, we will all have water and we will even have champagne after the election when the Government is returned.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, could not even come to the House to debate the issue.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach was not in the House to debate the Siteserv issue and neither was the T&aacute;naiste.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, went into a Garda station to report a missing man, a missing Taoiseach.  He could not be found.  He gave a description about his appearance and where he might be found, such as opening a bottle bank in Mayo or somewhere with his thumbs up or taking a selfie or over licking Angela Merkel and those people.  That is where he could be found, but he will not be found here.  However, he will be found out in Mayo, in Castlebar and all over the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will be found out too for the fraud that he is.  Those frauds are milking the people and crushing them into the ground and giving an issue such as this sustenance, more oil, fumes and consultants.  <\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, announced this week that &euro;637,000 would be spent on IT consultants to get back the &euro;100 people never asked for.  It is nonsense to do that instead of taking &euro;100 off the bill.  Conservation grant how are you.  There is not a litre of conservation asked for or recommended.  It is just a pure Mills and Boon farce.  As soon as the Government changes it and puts it somewhere else the better, and allow people the dignity and respect they should have and give the respect to the county council officials and workers who have always supplied the water and they did not have a big stop valve stopping water in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or coming into the bounds of Dublin.  Otherwise, we would all be here with our tongues out.  The Government&rsquo;s tongue will be out before it is finished because the people will put it out.  Go raibh maith agat and good riddance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200012#K00200","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434105600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434105600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 117(1A), the division is postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday next, 16 June 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200013#L00300","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Direct Provision Report: Motion","time":1434105600,"counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200013#L00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1434105600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall consider the Report of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions entitled 'Report on the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the Direct Provision System (DPS) and the extension of the remit of Freedom of Information to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the DPS including all the suppliers of goods and services, whether from the Private or Public Sectors', copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7th May, 2015.<\/blockquote>I wish to express my appreciation on behalf of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system, DPS, and the extension of the remit of freedom of information to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system, including all the suppliers of goods and whether from the private or public sectors.<\/p><p>Ireland is the only EU member state without a single refugee or asylum seekers application process, a key reason the direct provision system is not fit for purpose.  In terms of European directives, Ireland did not opt in to Directive 2003\/9 which laid down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers.  If Ireland had agreed to opt in to that directive, then Oireachtas approval would have been required.  However, the Government decision not to opt in did not require any Oireachtas approval.  When Directive 2003\/8 was recast under a new directive, namely, 2013\/33, and the Government again took the decision not to opt in, once again no Oireachtas approval was required.  That is a gap, a lacuna, that needs to be addressed for the very simple reason that the policy environment in 2003 was vastly different to the policy environment today.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, I met with counterparts from the Welsh Assembly, who said that petitions for a parliament or an elected assembly are often the canary in the coal mine, a metaphor for an early warning of serious danger ahead.  It is a phrase that has remained with me over the course of detailed work on Ireland's direct provision system by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, which I have the privilege of chairing.  In recent months, the committee has visited four direct provision centres nationwide and hosted a series of meetings in Leinster House on the topic.  The resulting report on the direct provision system, which was published recently and is being debated today, is a canary in the coal mine moment.  The report pulls no punches in criticising the application system for being unnecessarily complicated and lengthy.  The current fractured process, which is responsible for the delays in issuing decisions, has been criticised by the European Union Court of Justice.<\/p><p>It was a system that was designed and resourced to be a short-term solution, but given that one in five residents are in the direct provision system for seven or more years the direct provision system is no longer a short-term solution.  That, and that alone, is more than sufficient to justify the statement that the system is utterly unfit for purpose.  The heightened media coverage in recent months and resulting increase in public awareness of the inadequacies of the current system are to be welcomed.  Our cross-party committee report adds weight to the emerging consensus on the grave deficiencies in the current system.  The report finds the delay in processing the applications of residents is inexcusable, perpetrates inequality and ill treatment at a State level and leads to a systemic problem with the provision of public services.<\/p><p>Another key finding is that the weekly allowances of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child, which have not changed since they were introduced 15 years ago, are insufficient, derisory and have been eroded to the point of being insulting to residents.  We are calling for the allowance to be raised.  Ordinary Irish citizens have access to the Ombudsman to advance concerns on public service delivery, while those in the direct provision system do not.  We, therefore, have a section of Irish society being neglected and quite possibly being discriminated against because at a very basic human level they are being treated differently to other citizens in not having the system of which they are a part open to oversight.  While the current system is in place, the respective jurisdictions of the Ombudsman for the public service and the Ombudsman for Children must be extended to include the direct provision system.<\/p><p>We also call for the Freedom of Information Acts to be extended to include the direct provision system and the Reception and Integration Agency.  Given that robust independent oversight is required, the Reception and Integration Agency should also establish a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints system for residents.  Our cross-party committee also has particular concerns in relation to Ireland opting out of EU rules laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers.  Only two countries in Europe have opted out - Ireland and Denmark.  The reason Denmark opted out is that its legislation was stronger than the directive.  It wanted stronger supports than were provided for in the directive.As I said, our committee is deeply concerned that the Oireachtas never had the opportunity to express its view on Ireland's approach to opting out of both Directive 2003\/9 and Directive 2013\/33.  The directives compel member states to ensure that applicants have access to the labour market not later than nine months, and we are calling for the restriction on applicants' right to work to be lifted as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>Having visited four centres in Galway, Foynes, Mosney and Clondalkin, and heard first-hand the complaints of residents, the committee calls for greater access to health services and child care.  Resident after resident pointed to access to appropriate health services, including mental health services, as a major issue.  Therefore, we are calling on the Joint Committee on Health and Children to follow up on these concerns.  We were particularly moved by the meetings with residents in the various centres.I am mindful that many of these residents have come from dreadful situations in their own countries.  They have been traumatised and experienced God knows what.  To have that trauma exacerbated by being stuck in what is essentially a prison, except that one can go for a walk outside every day and avail of services, for many years is unacceptable.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland <i>per capita<\/i>is the biggest contributor to overseas aid, a legacy of which we are immensely proud.  That is matched by the huge contributions by the Irish people directly to various charities that work overseas.  Clearly, Irish people have a passion for those who are caught up in these devastating situations overseas.<br\/><br\/>I discovered earlier this year by reading a book that Ireland is the only country which today has a population that is less than in the early 1800s.  All of us in these Houses know the reason for that.  We have seen millions of our sons and daughters emigrate throughout the decades from the early 1800s through to today.  In recent years, our sons and daughters and brothers and sisters travelled to Australia, Canada, Britain and the US.  They were not asylum seekers but economic migrants.  For our migrants in the US, the undocumented Irish, we seek to have their residency and status regularised.  Of all the countries in Europe, I would have thought Ireland would be to the forefront not at providing an open door, because we cannot do that in the context of a European Union that does not and, therefore, we would invite to much of a demand, but at least have a system that reflects the decency of the Irish people and reflects our history of emigration.<br\/><br\/>One other statistic is from a book by Mr. Raymond Crotty in 1987.  At that time, he revealed that of all the children born here since the foundation of the State through to 1987, about 65 years, half of those who survived childhood had emigrated.  That is a shocking statistic.  In rural communities, we are particularly aware of the devastating impact of the loss of our generations.  I put that on the record as a reminder to all of us of why this failure is absolutely unacceptable and unsustainable moving forward and how it does not reflect the true character and the true values of the Irish people.  <br\/><br\/>The sad reality for me is that the centres are out of sight and out of mind.  I believe that if our people could meet these residents and look into the eyes of the men and women I met, which showed the despair they have about their situation, this would not be tolerated for one more day.This is a shame on our people.  It does not reflect the true values of our people and it needs to stop as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>As a parent, I am deeply disturbed when I think that one third of the 4,360 residents in the direct provision system are children.  In the future, how will they regard our failure to stand up and say a wrong is being committed in the name of the people who elected us and we never said &quot;stop&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I express my appreciation to the members of the joint committee, to the clerk, Mr. Ronan Lenihan, who put a huge amount of work into the report and attended all the visits to the centres and deserves particular mention, and to the excellent committee secretariat staff who worked so hard.  I ask that this report be regarded as the canary in the mine.  Action is needed.  There is a big difficulty with the direct provision system but the root cause is the need to have a single asylum or refugee application process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200013#L00500","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434106200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the report by the joint committee.  Although important in itself, this will aid in the decision process to be engaged in by Government in the context of recommendations to be made in the forthcoming report of independent working group on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.  I understand that report will be presented to Government this month.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Members of the joint committee for their diligence in going about their business in relation to this topic, in respect of which, as this House knows, I have had a long-standing interest.  Quite properly, members made on the ground visits to four direct provision centres in Galway, Limerick, Meath and Dublin, and these were a cross section of the 34 asylum accommodation centres across the State in which 4,500 persons currently reside.  The Deputy is correct in saying that approximately one third of those are children and approximately one third of those have been in the system for more than five years.  Since my appointment as Minister of State last year, I too have visited centres in Waterford, Dublin, Sligo, Laois, Mosney, Galway, Limerick and Clare to see for myself the conditions in which these residents live.  The dry facts set out in official documents and reports cannot properly convey the day-to-day realities which they face, which mostly revolve around waiting and hoping.  None the less, I am glad the report also acknowledges that many owners, management and staff seek to alleviate the consequences of the direct provision system.<\/p>  <p>  I also appreciate that the committee held two hearings on this matter, the first on 22 October 2014 involving asylum seekers and NGOs and the second on 1 April 2015 which I and two officials from the Department of Justice and Equality attended.  At my appearance on 1 April, I made my own views on this subject clear to the committee.  I cannot and will not stand over the system of direct provision.  <\/p>  <p>  In its report, the committee focuses on recommendations which fall within its remit but also makes recommendations on various aspects of the direct provision system for consideration by other relevant sectoral Oireachtas committees.  I think this unusual approach is inevitable given the quite broad nature of the State's responsibilities in the area of international protection.<\/p> <p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>While my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I fully support the independent working group under the chairmanship of a former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, we do not know what recommendations will be made in its pending report.  Equally, we have not sought to influence its conclusions.  Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume the report will address many of the issues raised in the joint committee's report.  I understand the working group's report will amalgamate reports from three smaller and more focused subgroups dealing with specific themes: conditions in centres, supports for asylum seekers, and improvements in the processing of protection claims.<br\/><br\/>While I do not wish to anticipate the working group report, which is due to be presented to the Government this month, I will address the four recommendations in its report that the joint committee considers to be within its remit: that a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints system be provided for residents under the house rules of the direct provision centre; that the legal remit for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman or Children be extended to include the direct provision system, as well as the administration of law relating to immigration and naturalisation; that responsibility for centre inspections be given to an independent body, such as HIQA; and that the Freedom of Information Acts be extended to cover the direct provision system, as well as the administration of the law relating to immigration and naturalisation.<br\/><br\/>The issue that is the subject of the first recommendation - the apparent need for a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints mechanism - came to the fore in the judgment issued by the High Court in November 2014 in the CA and TA case.  Although the High Court found that the direct provision system did not breach human rights, it did find that certain aspects of the house rules dealing with guests, signing in and the lack of an independent appeals mechanism were unlawful.  Although the issue was discussed at the working group, I understand it will not form part of its recommendations.  Nevertheless, revised house rules which address the court's findings have been issued in the meantime.  The rules now provide for the option of a final appeal to an independent complaints officer.  I should record here that the judgment in the CA and TA case is under appeal.<br\/><br\/>The second recommendation concerns the extension of the legal remit for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include the direct provision system and the administration of law relating to immigration and naturalisation.  As things stand, this is a matter of legislation which falls within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 5(1)(<i>e<\/i>) of the Ombudsman Act 1980 and section 11(1)(<i>e<\/i>) of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 provide that neither ombudsman shall investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, asylum.  This has been interpreted to include the direct provision system.  I note that the view of the current Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, as expressed to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on 11 March 2015, is that decisions on matters other than immigration status, including decisions on issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaints processes, are in his remit.<br\/><br\/>The first point to be made on this recommendation is that it is not intended under any circumstances that either ombudsman will serve as a first instance appellant authority in relation to day-to-day administrative complaints mechanisms.  It is a requirement that a person who wishes to appeal to the Ombudsman must first try to solve the problem with the public body concerned using a formal local appeals mechanism.  I have already referred to the changes in the house rules providing for a final independent complaints mechanism, even if that falls short of recourse to the Ombudsman.  The current administrative processes which lead to decisions on asylum claims are substantially set out in legislation.  First instance protection decisions are made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and are subject to appeals before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both offices are legally independent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and their decisions can be judicially reviewed by the courts.  The Government would have to consider carefully how the addition of another independent body into this process would affect a system that is already complicated.  Pending consideration by the Government of the report of the independent working party, there are no plans to change those legislative provisions to give either office the power to investigate asylum-related matters.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second recommendation, and on the issue of processing, I point out that earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, published the general scheme of an international protection Bill, the aim of which is to reduce waiting times for asylum applicants.  The key provision of the Bill will be to replace the existing multilayered protection determination system with a single procedure, the aim of which will be to enable timely and efficient protection decisions.  This single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage people who have no entitlement to stay in the State and can safely return to their country of origin.  Further on this specific recommendation, notwithstanding the legal situation, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, have administrative arrangements in place with both ombudsman offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to their attention.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the third recommendation, which is that responsibility for centre inspections should be given to an independent body such as HIQA.  While it is understandable that HIQA is cited as an example of an independent inspection body, it is not the only one.  Moreover, its remit is strictly covered in legislation.  It is important to point out that RIA, which is the unit in the Department of Justice and Equality responsible for the administration of the direct provision system, already engages an independent private body to carry out inspections of its centres.  All centres are subject to a minimum of three unannounced inspections a year.  One inspection is carried out by QTS, which is an independent company under contract to RIA, and the other two are carried out by RIA officials.  All completed inspections are published on RIA's website and this adds to the transparency of the system.  Researchers, Deputies, residents of centres, NGO officials and everyone else can examine these reports in detail.  It has to be said that asylum accommodation centres do not exist in isolation.  They are subject to RIA inspections and other State inspections.  They are, for example, subject to inspection by fire officers and, in relation to food issues, to unannounced inspections by environmental health officers.  This is not to say that the inspection regime cannot be improved, as it can.  I await the working group findings in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The fourth recommendation relates to the freedom of information regime, which has long applied to INIS and RIA.  By virtue of the Freedom of Information Act 2014, it has been extended to Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with effect from 14 April last.  The usual provisions and exemptions of the Freedom of Information Acts apply in relation to commercially sensitive matters.  There are no special provisions relating to immigration-related matters.  In order to be as transparent as possible, RIA currently makes available on request contract details for all contracts to the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously.  For example, at the end of January 2015, the records were updated to the end of December 2012.  These records provide a context for the moneys paid for each contract, such as the length of the contract and the number of people for which services are contracted.<br\/><br\/>I believe the joint committee has performed a very useful public service with its report.  That report, along with the report of the working group, will fully inform the Government in the decisions it will have to make in reforming a system which has the subject of much deserved criticism.  I look forward to listening to this afternoon's D&aacute;il debate on the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200014#M00200","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434106800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am glad to be afforded an opportunity to speak on this issue.  The system of direct provision for asylum seekers was 15 years old earlier this year.  This issue has certainly led to much substantial debate, some of it informed and some of it misinformed.  I would not say that some of the commentary sometimes borders on the hysterical, but it is certainly not always informed.  Many issues have been raised about the duration of people's stays in direct provision and the impact this can have on family life and on children.  The question of the right to work has also been raised.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn summed it up when he said that the restrictions imposed on those in direct provision mean it is like being \"in what is essentially a prison, except that one can go for a walk\".  It is not really conducive to family life and the best ways of rearing children, etc.  Other issues have been raised, including the need for the weekly allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child to be increased.  Issues relating to accommodation quality, access to third level education, mental health and transition from direct provision have also been highlighted.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, over 15 years have passed since this system was drawn up as an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  When efforts were being made at that time to find accommodation for asylum seekers in direct provision, guesthouses, hotels and other buildings that were fit for purpose, or sometimes not fit for purpose, were brought into use.  In many cases, landlords, businessmen and entrepreneurs were following the money more than they were providing the correct service.  We have come a long way since then.  Many asylum seekers were accommodated in smaller towns around the country where they did not have direct access to public transport.  We have moved a long way and we are now providing better accommodation, but it can always improve.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to commend the work of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, which has clearly found that the system is not fit for purpose.  In a statement of priorities in 2014, this Government indicated that it is very much committed to addressing the issue of the direct provision system.  This includes the introduction of a single application procedure for asylum seekers and the establishment of an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements in direct provision and support for asylum seekers.  As we know from the report of the working group, a protection process is now imminent.<\/p> <p> The direct provision system was a policy response 15 years ago to an accommodation crisis, when asylum seeker numbers increased from 362 applicants in 1994 to 7,724 in 1999 and a peak of 11,634 in 2002.  The cost to the State of making direct provision arrangements has gone down, but it is clearly unacceptable that the average stay in direct provision facilities is four years.  It is reported that in some cases residents have been in such facilities for up to 14 years.  Dr. Colletta Dalikeni, a lecturer who has carried out much research in the area, raises some important insights about asylum-seeking families, many of whom are living at the margins of Irish societies.  She states that many of these families and social workers are caught between the child protection and immigration system, and there are clear questions of how to marry the legal framework with the need for an appropriate humanistic approach to complex issues.<\/p> <p> Surmounting the challenges will certainly not be easy, but I am confident that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will introduce procedures to speed up the process that has seen some asylum seekers spending years in direct provision centres.  It is fair to say that all stakeholders now know the problems, and we must find solutions.  Not only should we make the system more respectful to applicants; we must also think about how it can be less costly to the taxpayer.  Vast sums of money were thrown at this serious problem which did not address the core issue.  It helped make many would-be entrepreneurs much richer, but they did not provide the correct service.<\/p> <p> As we are discussing direct provision, asylum seekers and people seeking citizenship, a most encouraging aspect is the number of what have effectively become Irish citizenship days in the Convention Centre.  Many asylum seekers have taken the oath to our nation to become Irish citizens and they are proud to do so.  The joy on the day is something that must be seen to be believed.  I know many who have taken part and they ring me on the day they become Irish citizens.  I am very proud that these people are so happy to be accepted into our country, and I know they and their families will be valued members of our communities and the nation.  They will go on to ensure that Ireland will remain a great nation.<\/p> <p> There are a few issues that should be mentioned.  I have heard some anecdotal evidence in the past two or three days about one issue in particular, although I know much has been done.  This anecdotal evidence indicates that many people are coming to this country through the UK, taking the ferry from there to Northern Ireland, where there is an open border.  There seems to be much welfare fraud, although I know it is being tackled.  I hope this House will be able to debate that issue in future days and weeks.  It seems many people are now getting married to European citizens but after seven years these can be seen as sham marriages.  I know these issues are being raised as anecdotal evidence.  In the past few days I met two different people who raised that matter.  It would be remiss of me not to mention that there are difficulties and problems.  We need to get answers.  I understand the Department of Social Protection has done much work in tackling welfare fraud, but we must do more.  I look forward to a debate on that as well.<\/p> <p> This is a welcome report, as the people in direct provision are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters.  They deserve our protection and a solution to a long-outstanding issue.  I hope the Government, along with other Members in the House, can help to solve this difficult issue and overcome the unnecessary delays.  I look forward to debating these issues in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200015#N00200","speaker":"1085","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434107400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I commend the Oireachtas joint committee on its work in the area, including extensive research and the manner in which it has sought to fully inform itself about a process that had been allowed to deteriorate in such a way that it necessitates immediate action.  I pay tribute to all members of the committee and commend them on that work and the preparation of the report, which contains many recommendations.  It is interesting in the context of this short debate that the Minister of State has set out a stall in response to the main recommendations of the report.  He might elaborate slightly on them, although I know that in the absence of a final recommendation from the working group, he cannot respond in whole.  He might give some indication as to his thinking and the mechanism that could be put in place that would reflect a meeting of all minds who have the best of intentions in this area.  Such a mechanism should address the issue properly and effectively from now on.<\/p>  <p>  In Fianna F&aacute;il we share a number of concerns about the policy of direct provision.  In particular, there is the excessively long waiting time before an asylum application is decided.  Legislation should be introduced immediately to create a new single and integrated process of application for asylum.  It is clear that there is a significant problem surrounding the length of time a person spends in direct provision.  Approximately 46% of residents are there for three years or more, and a further 14% have been there for seven years or more.  This is clearly unacceptable and the issue should be dealt with.  In particular, the early years of children are impacted by unsuitable living conditions in the direct provision facilities for families.<\/p>  <p>  In 2010, Fianna F&aacute;il sought to pass the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, which allowed for a new single and integrated process of application for protection, replacing applications for refugee status, subsidiary protection and leave to remain.  This legislative provision has yet to be implemented, and I know the Minister of State has commented on the publication of the heads of a Bill relating to this earlier this year.  We implore him and the Government to bring forward the relevant legislation in this area in order to effect the sort of change that we all agree is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has stated that the main factor contributing to the upward trend is the length of time in the leave-determining process, including legal proceedings.  Another factor in the time delay is the lack of a single application process for asylum, as I mentioned.  On 25 March the Government published the heads of the new international protection Bill, whose principal purpose is the establishment of a single procedure for examination of applications for international protection or asylum in Ireland, incorporating eligibility for refugee status and eligibility for subsidiary protection status as well.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of our spokesperson in the area, one issue has come to my attention in preparing for this debate.  Following publication of the heads of the Bill, Ms Sue Conlon, the chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council, resigned from the working group on the protection process, citing the publication of the heads of the Bill before the working group had had sight of or discussed the most significant changes in refugee law in Ireland for almost 20 years.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State put that in context from his perspective and indicate how he believes the existing working group can have a meaningful input into any amendments that may emerge once the Bill is brought to the House?<\/p> <p> I turn now to the Minister of State's response to the four main areas, as he saw it, of what was contained in the report.  I hope I am interpreting his response appropriately, but he may correct the record if I am wrong.  The first recommendation in the report refers to extending the legal remits of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include the direct provision system.  The Minister of State appears to say that what he proposes can deal with it effectively, even if it falls short of the recommendation regarding the Ombudsman.  If there are four main proposals, the Minister of State is saying that he is not prepared to accede to the first one but that what he is proposing can have the desired effect despite the fact that it falls short of what is sought in the report.<\/p> <p> The second recommendation refers to the administration of the law relating to immigration and naturalisation.  The Minister of State has said that while the working group continues its deliberations it would not be correct for him to respond to this request until such time as its work is complete.  I take his response in good faith.  It might be the right response.  Does he have any indication as to when the working group will report and what does he propose to do thereafter?  Might he amend the heads based on the suggestions that emanate from that source?<\/p> <p> The third recommendation relates to the inspections.  The committee saw fit to recommend that HIQA should meet the need in that regard.  The Minister of State says that he believes the existing mechanism used for inspections should remain in place.  He believes its remit, reporting mechanisms, recommendations and the scrutiny of those recommendations are sufficient for his Department to have full jurisdiction and he is happy that it is doing its duty.  The committee recommends going beyond that by using an independent authority, but the Minister of State does not appear to be prepared to accept the recommendation.<\/p> <p> The last one dealt with the freedom of information issue.  Again, the Minister of State is happy that the existing mechanisms and facilities within the Department for information to flow are sufficient and do not require further recommendations in this area.  The committee is at variance with that, so perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on the issue.<\/p> <p> It is incumbent on the Minister of State to broaden his response and to give an indication as to when the working group will report.  That having been done, is there a mechanism through which the Minister of State could bring together all the parties and stakeholders, all of whom appear to have the same objective, to ensure there is all-party unity on this issue and to ensure the legislation is informed, correct and appropriate to address the humanitarian issue that must be addressed as soon as possible for those concerned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200016#O00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434108000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  I thank the committee for the report and congratulate it on the speed of its work.  The report is comprehensive and all of us agree it is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Dealing with asylum has been a vexed issue for Ireland because we have experienced dramatic fluctuations in the number of people coming here over a short number of years.  In 1994, just over 300 asylum seekers arrived on our shores, but over 11,500 arrived in 2002.  The numbers dropped during the recession but are creeping up again.  Last year there was a 50% increase on the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  I was a Member of the House when the large numbers of people started to arrive to our shores seeking asylum.  They were treated very differently from how they are treated now in terms of processing.  They were treated as homeless persons and housed by local authorities.  They received all the welfare services available to Irish citizens.  However, the truth is that the services were quickly swamped.  The local authorities, health services, education services and particularly our maternity hospitals found themselves unable to cope.  Many pregnant women were brought directly from Dublin Airport to the Rotunda Hospital.  It was something for which the hospitals could not plan.<\/p>  <p>  The strain on the health, education, welfare and housing services and the growing cost of providing for asylum seekers demanded a rethink.  Direct provision was introduced at that point.  The change was also motivated by the difficulty the immigration services had in tracking asylum seekers when they arrived and dispersed around the country seeking work.  It was very difficult to process their applications.  It was particularly difficult to track unaccompanied minors, many of whom simply disappeared.  They were supposed to be in the care of the health services but many of them just disappeared.  To this day nobody knows what happened to many of them.<\/p>  <p>  My recollection is that the introduction of direct provision was welcomed by most Deputies.  It satisfied our consciences that migrants were being properly cared for, that they had access to health and education and were housed and fed.  At the same time, it took problems that were becoming increasingly visible on the streets off the streets.  There was a growing perception, and unfortunately there were complaints, that somehow asylum seekers were getting a better deal than Irish people and that they had easier access to housing and so forth.  This was not the case.  In reality, most of them were housed in bed and breakfast accommodation, which forced them out onto the streets during the day.  <\/p>  <p>  People considered the accommodation centres to be a perfect solution, but it was never envisaged that they would be a long-term solution and that families would live indefinitely in such conditions.  It is unforgivable that people should spend years living in these centres and that entire childhoods should be spent there.  I cannot begin to think of what the emotional and psychological effects are on children and what issues they will have in adult life.<\/p>  <p>  In the media release from the Ombudsman on Wednesday he said the report called for the abolition of direct provision.  To be honest, I did not see that in the report and I do not believe it should be abolished.  However, it should be fixed.  The report recommends bringing the system under the remit of the Ombudsman and making it subject to freedom of information.  I am not convinced about either of those, particularly the latter.  The justice system requires a level of confidentiality that might not apply to other areas of life.  However, notwithstanding the legal status of their presence in this country, if asylum seekers are not going to have the same safeguards of their human rights as other citizens, it behoves the State to ensure that their human rights are protected and vindicated.  I believe that will be recommended by the report of the working group and by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations in the committee's report refer to the lack of privacy for families, the lack of income to pay for certain medicines, having to take children out of school to sign on and the absence of even basic self-catering facilities.  These complaints are valid and should be examined as quickly as possible.  That said, conditions in these reception centres are infinitely better than the conditions asylum seekers have left.  However, they are not acceptable as a way of life that endures for years, and certainly not for seven and even 11 years in some cases.<\/p><p>Part of the problem is the length of time it takes to assess applications for asylum due to the three-stage process and the three appeal stages.  The report suggests that the length of time is inexplicable, and I agree with that.  It is no wonder that people call for asylum seekers to be allowed to work after a certain period as they await a decision.  I understand this, because it must devastate people to have nothing to do day after day and year after year.  It is ironic that training courses for work are provided but that they cannot work.  However, I have a problem in regard to allowing asylum seekers to work.  Apart from the fact that they are competing for jobs when there is a shortage of jobs for Irish citizens, there are other practical problems.  The solution is not to allow them to work but to speed up the application process.  I welcome the Minister of State's decision to introduce the fast-track single application process, which I hope will reduce the problem and prevent people from languishing indefinitely in these accommodation centres.<\/p> <p> If we did not have a 10% indigenous unemployment rate and if we allowed asylum seekers to work, that would be like saying we were renouncing control of our borders entirely.  We would be granting people who are here illegally the same rights to employment and the same freedom to move around the country as we accord our own citizens, EU citizens and citizens here on legitimate visas.  Another danger is the pull factor if that kind of information is made known.  Despite what one hears, few countries allow access to employment for asylum seekers.  Most countries do not, and many go as far as putting asylum seekers into detention centres while they wait for their cases to be assessed.  The solution is to get people out of reception centres as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> Our plan to introduce a single application process will not solve the problem on its own.  The time involved is extended beyond the determining period by two factors.  First, those who get a favourable decision on their application cannot move out because there is no accommodation for them.  Therefore, they stay in the reception centres.  Second, those who get an unfavourable decision are not deported.  One way or another, many asylum seekers remain in the accommodation centres.  This makes a complete farce of the asylum seeking system.  Win or lose, few people move out of what was originally envisaged as temporary accommodation and very few are deported.  Hopefully, the housing crisis will be resolved in time, but we need to get back to a situation in which rejection of an asylum seeker's application means something and those whose asylum claims are invalid are deported.  Otherwise, there is no point to the system.<\/p> <p> Relative to other countries, such as Italy, the number of people seeking asylum in Ireland is very small.  This will change, whether we like it or not.  The number of people crossing the Mediterranean will continue to increase for as long as the gap in the standard of living between Europe and Africa exists.  World population growth will start to decrease in approximately 30 years, but in the meantime most of the expected 2 billion growth in the world population, from 7 billion to 9 billion, will happen in sub-Saharan Africa.  If people are poor and hungry in Africa today, they will be poorer and hungrier then and will want to leave.  I do not believe that sinking or capturing boats in the Mediterranean will do anything to stop the wave of immigrants coming from Africa.  It is time to think about investing in solving the problem at source and reducing the push factors of poverty, famine and conflict, which make it seem worthwhile to many asylum seekers to risk their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean.  Hundreds are doing so daily.<\/p> <p> The Dublin Convention is not working.  Italy has given up even trying to adhere to it and has effectively opened its northern borders to Europe, and asylum seekers are moving out of Italy in waves into Europe.  This issue is influencing elections in Europe and will soon start to change governments.  We need an honest debate on this issue in Ireland and in the European Union about what we will do to change this situation.  Will we increase aid or change our policies in respect of Africa?  Will we open our doors to Africa or will we close them completely?  Alternatively, will we accept quotas, and if so, how many asylum seekers will we accept?<\/p> <p> I was pleased to see that Ireland has increased the number of asylum seekers it will accept from Syria.  Clearly, these people are asylum seekers.  Tomorrow, I will visit the Turkish-Syrian border, where 2 million refugees and asylum seekers are waiting for the conflict to end or to move on into Europe.  Turkey has accommodated these refugees at the moment.  Imagine the situation if this number of people arrived into Ireland or Europe and the destabilising effect that might have.  This is a wake-up call for Europe and for the need to have an honest debate on this issue.  We must decide what we are going to do and then do it.  One way or another, the wave of immigration is almost unstoppable and we need to plan how to handle it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200017#P00200","speaker":"1026","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434108600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I have spoken on this issue a number of times previously.  I welcome and support this report and congratulate the committee members on the work they have done.  In the context of reports that have come from committees, in my brief time in the D&aacute;il, this is one of the best we have seen.  It is clear and concise and makes some excellent recommendations.  I commend the committee and welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of the report.<\/p>  <p>  Our direct provision system is not fit for purpose.  It is a stain on the nation.  The Government has done much in a relatively short period and in general has prioritised the right issues.  However, we must not leave this issue on the table.  When it comes to the next election, I do not want this issue to be in the manifesto of Fine Gael, the Labour Party or any other party.  I want this to be an issue for which we have found a conclusion, a proper and definitive answer as to how we will reform and change our system.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work the Minister of State has done and the personal interest he has taken in this issue and  look forward to the report that is due to be issued at the end of this month.  I urge the Minister of State to act on that report immediately.  If we do not act on it, a resolution of this issue will be delayed.  Other governments have blamed the failure to act on delays, but let us not find ourselves blaming the calling of the next election for a delay that means we do not have the chance of dealing with it in time.  The Minister of State will get all the support he needs from backbenchers for whatever work he tries to do following the report.<\/p>  <p>  On previous occasions, when discussing this issue in the House, I have had the opportunity to speak about the personal stories that I and others dealing with this issue have come across.  I first got involved in politics six years ago and from the first day people came to me with their stories.  I heard stories of mental health difficulties, abuse of power in the provision centres and bullying.  I heard stories from this almost hidden community in our society.  These people are almost lost within Irish life.  Now, because this situation has gone on for so long, the majority of the stories we hear are about children who have grown up in direct provision.  The only memories they have are of direct provision.  How have we allowed this to happen and what does it say about this country in this day and age?<\/p>  <p>  Other speakers have referred to the problems these people will have as a result.  This is a terrible legacy for them.  The impact of the system on children from a young age is that this becomes their life.  Unfortunately, it is not something they can get away from easily.  Adults have also had a difficult time, and I have come across many of these.  As they have moved into nationalisation and become citizens, they have found reasons to hope and be happy and have begun to rebuild their lives.  This has not happened without difficulty, but they have got that chance.  However, it is far more difficult for a child who has only known this system.  It is wrong that children have grown up in this system.<\/p>  <p>  I support the recommendations.  I also believe we need to introduce an amnesty, because what was meant to be a temporary system - for six months or more - has evolved into a more permanent system.  On average the process takes four years, although I have met people who are in the system far longer.  This is our fault, but it is also our responsibility.  I believe these people deserve an amnesty and that we should make them citizens.  This should be one of the recommendations the Minister of State makes when he finally gets the opportunity to resolve the situation.  I commend the report and the work he has done.  It is one of the best reports to have come through the House since I was elected to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200018#Q00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1434109200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  As I said previously, this is one of the issues that goes beyond politics in this House.  I have been impressed by the level of interest that Deputies and Senators from different parties have taken in this discussion on this area of direct provision.  However, references to welfare fraud do not help when we are discussing the issue of direct provision in this country.  We have had a love affair with incarcerating people.  We did it in mental institutions in the 1950s.  We did it in the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools, and we continue to do it with the direct provision system.  I know Department officials do not like those comparisons, and they know that when the original decision was made to establish direct provision centres - there were 60 initially and now there are only 34 - it was in response to a particular situation.  The amount of time that it was envisaged somebody would stay in a direct provision centre was six months and now people have been living there for more than ten years, and there are children who know nothing else but a direct provision centre.  That has belittled them and stripped them of their dignity.<\/p>  <p>  I am very taken by the human stories that, individually and collectively, we have come across in direct provision centres.  One man in Limerick has been completely broken by what we have done to him.  Obviously, his circumstances in the country where he came from resulted in him being very vulnerable but we have compounded that and broken him.  I feel a great sense of duty to that individual, and to the other 4,500 people who are living in the system, one third of whom are children and one third of whom have been living there for over five years.  I would stay in some of the centres but I would not spend a night in some of the others.  I recall seeing in one centre a corridor of eight sleeping units separated by curtains.  I would not stay in it, and I would not expect anybody else to stay in it either.<\/p>  <p>  While every other country in Europe seems to be strangled with the conversation around immigration and xenophobia, this House and this country can be proud of the fact that we have not allowed the issue of asylum, immigration or integration strangle our political debate, and it does not come to the forefront of election discussions.  However, I am awaiting the publication of the report.  Decent, honourable people who are as critical of the direct provision system as anybody could sit on that working group.  The reason for its establishment was to assemble the people who know the system best as well as officials who are overseeing the system and officials from different Departments who need to be discussing issues with them such as education, the environment and social protection, and allow them come to conclusions.  On one particular issue I am led to believe that 15 individual meetings took place.  That is why, when I was expecting originally that we could assemble the group in September and have a report by Christmas, it has proved almost impossible to do it in that timeframe.  While I was hoping to get the report last month, it now appears it will be ready this month but if we want to do something, we have to do it well.<\/p>  <p>  It would be my intention, and I am sure the intention of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on receipt of the report to bring it to Government first, publish it and then implement it because all the hard work has been done.  All the convincing of officials has been done and as Deputy Murphy rightly said, it is now the responsibility of Government to implement it during this term.<\/p>  <p>  In this post-referendum era when we are all talking about equality, there are other groups in society who want to know what this new feeling of equality will give to them.  They are members of the Traveller community, people who live in socially and economically deprived areas, young people, old people, new people to our country, and certainly people living in direct provision centres.<\/p>  <p>  While my individual responses to the report may have left some Deputies less than inspired, and I appreciate Deputy Mac Lochlainn's endeavours in this regard which reflect very well on his chairmanship of the committee and the members also as this is an issue they have taken on and feel so strongly about, when the report is published and people see what it contains we can finally turn the page on what has been a shameful period in Irish history that we cannot defend.  On the day I became Minister of State with responsibility for new communities in the Department of Justice and Equality I said this was not a system I could stand over.  It is a system that belittles and dehumanises people.  We cannot stand over a system where people are languishing for years, with a sense of having no future.<\/p>  <p>  A number of things have to happen.  What kind of system could I oversee?  What kind of system could we stand over?  It was initially envisaged that direct provision would be a system to tackle the homelessness crisis.  I can envisage a system where there is an excellently run centre, with proper oversight, links to the community and proper cooking facilities for families.  It can be suggested by people who do not understand the importance of proper cooking facilities that they are unimportant but they are very important to a mother and father who need to prepare food for their children.  We need proper family orientated dwellings.  We must do away with the idea, which I have seen in some centres, of a wardrobe in a single room separating the children's and the parents' sleeping conditions.  That is outrageous.  We must do away with that and have proper family living facilities but we must only ever envisage that somebody would be there for a matter of weeks or months, and certainly not more than six months and certainly not for a period of years.  The asylum system should treat these people with respect and dignity and we should not have a situation where people are languishing in it for years.<\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of Deputies in this House to make contributions to this debate, not to respond to uninformed, ill-judged, unresearched comments from constituents.  They should base all their comments regarding the asylum system or integration issues on facts.  That is very important when we are dealing with people who are vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  We have a fantastic opportunity now, in this post-referendum era and as we face into the commemoration of the 1916 Rising, to reassess our values as a Republic, and this is one of the areas which has been a stain on our reputation over the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  When the report comes to Government, and I have been told it will be this month, although I was expecting it next week - there may be a slight delay on that - the responsibility then is not just to publish but to implement.  If people such as representatives from the UNHCR, SPIRASI, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Jesuit refugee group, as well as representatives from academia and people with a history in the trade union movement, have taken the time, under the stewardship of Bryan McMahon, to come up with a report over this number of months, and they see it is workable, it is then the responsibility of Government to act and to ensure it is implemented in a timely fashion.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of how humane our system of direct provision is here, nobody wants to live in these centres.  They want to live a full and productive life, and we must be conscious of that.  Currently within the system there are 500 people who have leave to remain and do not need to be in direct provision, but we have an issue in terms of housing.  We have 500 individuals who have been granted permission to start a life in Ireland but they do not have the facilities to do so because of a housing issue and other supports they believe are necessary to transition.  That transitional period will be key to how we facilitate people to move out of direct provision and remain connected with the community in which they have been living for some time and where their children may be in school.  Helping them to integrate into that community and society and having supports available for them so that they can make that transition will be key as well.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding issues to do with education, young people in primary and secondary education can, as the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has already indicated, move on to third level.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the argument that asylum seekers should not be afforded the right to work.  My personal opinion is that we are standing outside the European norm when it comes to facilitating asylum seekers with the right to work.  That will remain an issue of contention and debate but the manner in which we have conducted this debate is a credit to this House, the political parties who serve in it, the Seanad and the committees which have raised this as an issue that we should pursue and correct.<\/p><p>Rather than taking credit in this House for the way the debate has been conducted, the greatest credit we will get is for implementing the report that will be given to the Government in the next few days.  We can then finally put to bed the scandal of direct provision.  Hopefully, those within the system can see a brighter future and we can have a system of which we can be rightly proud in a country that calls itself a republic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200019#R00100","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434109800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>First, I acknowledge the genuine personal commitment of the Minister of State to equality and how he applies it to his work.  In respect of the initial speech, I appreciate that the Department would want to respond to a number of the recommendations in the report and give its perspective.  This is, of course, its right.  The responses show disputes between the interpretation of current legislation between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Ombudsman.  The reason the committee undertook this report is the fact that one of our key responsibilities is to work with the Ombudsman to look at areas of concern.  The previous Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, who is now the European Ombudsman, repeatedly raised concerns about the failure to extend her jurisdiction to include the direct provision centres.  The current Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, outlined those concerns and raised them with the committee at a number of hearings.<\/p><p>As part of its work, the committee also met with the Ombudsman for Children who also raised concerns about oversight.  This was why we undertook the report.  I note that following our recommendations, press statements were issued by both offices.  The Ombudsman referred to the unambiguous independent oversight of that system, which is the key point.  He used the word &quot;clarification&quot;.  I will read into the record the comments of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, because they are even more important.  In response to our report, he said:<blockquote>Every child in Ireland, regardless of their status, deserves the same protection with the same access to an independent complaints mechanism.  One third of the 4,360 people currently residing in the Direct Provision System in Ireland are children (i.e. 1,453) and these children are being clearly discriminated against by failure to have any access to such a complaints process.<\/blockquote>He went on to say:<blockquote>The long-standing position of my Office is that the current exclusion to the investigatory remit of the Office in relation to the administration of the law regarding asylum and immigration relates only to decisions on status; my Office believes everything else - including issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaint handling - are in remit.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality does not share this understanding.  We have continually recommended that the Oireachtas put the matter beyond doubt and provide clear, unambiguous access for protection applicants to my Office.<\/blockquote>He concluded with the following:<blockquote>My Office aims to achieve systemic change through its investigatory work by tackling the root causes of the complaints we receive.  Following this morning's recommendations by the D&aacute;il PSOP Committee and the upcoming publication of the Report from the Working Group on Direct Provision there is now an opportunity to clarify the remit of the OCO so that my Office can fully investigate complaints related to the Direct Provision System in Ireland and by doing so, ensure that Ireland is on par with international best practice.<\/blockquote>I do not think the working group will adjudicate but it is important to engage with Department officials, possibly meet the two ombudsmen to see where they believe there is ambiguity and a lack of clarity and recommend that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform legislates for that.  I know both offices are respected by these Houses, are independent and have the respect and trust of the citizenry.  <\/p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendations are as good a contribution, if not better, than what we have done.  The commission, which is a body that is independent and respected by these Houses, pointed that the ombudsmen do not have appropriate oversight of the system.  I welcome the fact that there will be change to the pre-Ombudsman complaints system within the House rules.  There is a dispute concerning whether a complaint should go to that independent body before it goes to the Ombudsman.  This is generally the case.  The committee always says that the citizen should go through the complaints system available to them, regardless of whether it is the HSE or the council, to demonstrate that he or she utilised that system to try to get the concern addressed.  It then goes to the Ombudsman when he or she has exhausted this route.  This is known to be the case.  The issue is whether an appropriate, respected system that is understood to be independent exists.  Is information provided to residents in these centres?  Is the Ombudsman advertised in all of these centres as a recourse if people have exhausted other avenues?  Will there be posters with contact details for the independent complaints procedure?  Can we make it completely accessible in all of these centres?  They all have a central desk with information posters and residents' representative groups so it would be important that they are informed of their rights once the Ombudsman's role is clarified and strengthened in this regard.  <\/p><p>The next point relates to HIQA.  I note that the Reception and Integration Agency talks about an independent private body called QTS.  That is not really good enough.  It notes environmental matters and fire safety as well but there should really be a range of statutory agencies that can exercise oversight and inspect the centres.  It has put in place an arrangement relating to an independent private company.  I do not think the public would accept that for public services.  This is why we have independent ombudsmen or inspection agencies.  HIQA is a robust organisation.  The matter needs to be looked at again.  I will be challenging the Reception and Integration Agency and the Department about whether it is really appropriate for a private company to operate an inspection system rather than for it to be dealt with clearly through legislation and a robust statutory agency with a clear set of established standards.  This depends on whether the system continues.  <\/p><p>The response from Department officials that was incorporated in the Minister of State's speech is that freedom of information is pretty much covered already.  The usual exclusionary provisions apply in respect of commercially sensitive matters.  The Ombudsman, who is the freedom of information commissioner, clearly interprets that there is a need for him to cover all aspects of the system.  For example, are the private companies which run these centres subject to freedom of information?  They are being given public money to run these centres.<\/p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Those who run the centres have been subjected to robust criticism but the committee found those who own and manage the centres we visited to be open, frank and concerned about the welfare of residents.  We all agree that the system is not fit for purpose.  The people who live in these centres are aggrieved and distressed, and that naturally leads to conflict.  Anybody who deals with this cohort of people must manage conflict.  It would be unfair if I did not acknowledge that the owners and managers of the centres we visited fully co-operated with the committee, answered all of our questions and provided us with full and open access.  They also outlined their perspectives on these matters, which reflected their concern for the welfare of residents.  The problem is the system rather the people who manage the centres, and that is what we need to reform.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has a genuine passion for equality and addressing the challenges that remain across the equality sector.  I urge him to engage with the two ombudsmans' offices to clarify their remaining concerns so that they can be resolved through either legislation or changes to departmental rules.  It is clear that the Department and the ombudsmans' offices disagree on these matters, but we need to resolve this as our next step.<\/p> <p> I am grateful for the opportunity to debate our report and thank those who contributed to the discussion.  I look forward to studying the report of the working group and to the development of an application system that does not leave people to languish for years in these centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061200020#S00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434110400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434110400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 1.05 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 June 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
