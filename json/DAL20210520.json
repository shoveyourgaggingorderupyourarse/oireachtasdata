It is important to clarify that there is no legal definition of a feedlot herd.  The Department defines certain herds as controlled finishing units, CFUs, in the context of the bovine TB eradication programme.  This definition is unique to that programme and does not necessarily mirror the use of the term \"feedlot\" by the public and-or other institutions.  CFUs are subject to enhanced biosecurity measures as part of the TB programme and can only sell direct to slaughter.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to approve slaughter plants in accordance with the European Union (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations 2020 and after that to ensure that its approved plants operate in compliance with the EU's food hygiene legislation and animal health and welfare standards.  The Department's remit in regard to finishing units is to ensure that they operate in compliance with the EU's animal health and welfare standards.  The Department cannot, in carrying out this process, take into account issues such as the concentration of ownership of inputs to processing as it is outside the scope of this remit.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged the importance of transparency in the market for primary producers.  The Department is progressing several initiatives under my ministerial stewardship to increase transparency.  Central to my commitment to transparency is the establishment of a new office, to be called the office of the national food ombudsman or something similar.  The additional powers to be assigned to the new office by primary legislation, going beyond those in the unfair trading practices directive, are currently the subject of public consultation, which is open until 26 May.  This new office will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department and Bord Bia currently publish data in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the new office will be central in achieving transparency and ultimately ensuring that farmers are getting the best price possible in the market and that their income is maximised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000003#A00600","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1621497600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The only way we can ensure a food ombudsman or any other body will be able to tackle unfair practices within the sector is if we have all the information in the first instance.

We are basing all our information on the controlled finishing units, which serve as a proxy.  Even so, we know that 300,000 cattle, or over 15% of the total kill, came from within those units last year.  It is inconceivable to suggest they do not have an impact on the prices farmers receive.

If the public health authorities decided to review the experience of outbreaks in the sector, as suggested by the Deputy, the Department would certainly participate in such a review.  It is important to note that the public health advice for meat-processing plants has evolved since the start of the pandemic as the understanding of the risk factors has increased.<\/p> <p>Meat plants, particularly boning halls, can be noisy and humid workplaces and for food safety reasons the temperature is kept low through the recirculation of chilled air.  The experience internationally has been that because of these factors, the Covid-19 virus can be transmitted relatively easily between workers in meat plants.  To address these risk factors, detailed sector-specific public health guidelines were issued to meat processing plants early last summer, and implementation of these continues to be monitored.<br\/><br\/>As of 14 May 2021, the Department had completed 895 inspections, including unannounced inspections, on behalf of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine-approved food premises.  These inspections are ongoing and are in addition to the inspections carried out by the Health and Safety Authority itself, and in addition to the 49 premises where the Department has a permanent presence.  The Department has also supported the HSE as required in the context of local outbreak teams. <br\/><br\/>The Department continues to participate on a standing committee established last August to,<i>inter alia<\/i>, oversee a programme of polymerase chain reaction, PCR, serial testing of workers at larger meat plants and each cycle of PCR testing consists of four week cycles of testing.  The first cycle started on 14 September 2020 and a further eight cycles have been completed to date.  More than 180,000 tests have been carried out from cycles one to eight, with a positivity rate of 0.77% overall.The ninth cycle of serial testing is currently under way.<br\/><br\/><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><br\/><br\/>The Department has led and encouraged the roll-out of rapid antigen detection testing, RADT, at meat processing plants, as a risk mitigation measure.

SIPTU estimates that one in four meat workers got Covid-19 and that in turn seeded thousands of cases in the community.  That was evidenced by the high level of community transmission in counties and regions where there were numerous meat plants, counties such as Monaghan, Laois and Kildare, where we saw a spike in the level of what they called community transmission, but one has to ask how did the virus get into the community at that high level?<\/p>  <p>  The workers are not to blame.

Driving the development of the Irish organic sector is a major priority for me and my Department.  We have set the highest level of ambition ever for the sector in the programme for Government with an aim to reach the EU average of land farmed organically during the lifetime of this Government.  We are also committed to the full implementation of the current Review of Organic Food Sector and Strategy for its Development 2019-2025.  A key element in reaching this ambitious target is increasing the number of farmers farming organically.  To achieve this, I secured additional funding for this year to reopen the organic farming scheme.  I was delighted that 317 farmers have applied to convert to organic farming and perhaps, unlike the Deputy, I considered this quite a strong response given the many alternative scheme options that were available to farmers during this Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, transitional period.  If all these applicants are eligible and proceed to convert to organic farming, it will mean an increase of more than 20% in the number of farmers farming this way.  Of course, we are still waiting to find out what area of land these applications represent and we should know that shortly as the basic payment scheme, BPS, application window has just closed.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current budget allocated to the scheme this year will allow eligible applications successful entry into the scheme.  It is my intention to build on the interest shown to date and to drive further growth in organic farming.  I will be actively examining a further reopening of the scheme for next year subject to funding.  My Department is currently devising a new and ambitious organic farming scheme to be introduced under the new CAP in 2023 which will aim to increase the synergies that exist between organics, agri-environment climate measures and the eco-schemes and thus make organic farming a more attractive farming option.<\/p><p>Ultimately the development of the sector will be driven not just our scheme but by a range of factors.  We need to work closely with Bord Bia and indeed Teagasc to deliver on those.  I will certainly be trying to leverage as much support from both Bord Bia and Teagasc in this regard.  We need to keep the ambition high for organic farming, it is a very significant growth area and I look forward to seeing it grow.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>In association with Teagasc, the Department runs the organic farming demonstration programme.  Under this programme, a nationwide series of national organic farming open days takes place on selected organic demonstration farms.  This provides farmers with an insight into organic farming and is an invaluable tool in showcasing organic farming at a practical level.  This programme, by the sharing of knowledge at a local level, will hugely contribute to the conversion to organic farming.  <\/p><p>As well as all this however we may need to think even more broadly.  Many of our European counterparts use public procurement strategies to support their organic producers.  I want to look at whether or not we might do something similar here.  In this regard, the programme for government does include commitments to green public procurement, and I believe there is room to see how organic food production might fit with that.<\/p><p>In summary, nobody has shown the level of ambition for the Irish organic sector as this Government.

In the course of these negotiations, the Presidency has offered a compromise solution of a minimum of 85% convergence which has been rejected by the Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  I have argued that we must have subsidiarity to make our own call at national level.  I have held tight to the Council's general approach of a minimum of 75% convergence and 20% for the eco scheme, particularly so that we are in a position to make our own national call on convergence.  If we can get discretion at European level, we will have a full engagement with all farmers across the country and with all stakeholders about what approach we take domestically with regard to convergence.  It is an important issue and is always contested.  There are winners and losers.  It is important that we get as much power to set our own destiny as possible so that we can engage with everybody's ideas and talk to all farmers, then make our own call later this year.  First, we will have to see what is the minimum level at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000007#E01800","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1621500000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>In January last year, when the Minister was in opposition, he argued that there was no reasonable basis to stop the convergence process during the transition period.

I am pleased to say the first meeting of the independent working group took place on 4 March and it has met regularly since.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through the Horticulture Industry Forum, engages with the horticulture sector on an ongoing basis.  As recently as 20 April, I co-chaired a Horticulture Industry Forum meeting where the challenges and opportunities facing the industry were discussed.  At a broader level, the Department provides support to the horticulture industry through the scheme of investment aid for the development of the horticulture sector.  Financial support is available to assist growers and businesses through grant aid for capital investments in specialised plant and equipment, including renewable energy, as well as technology adoption specific to commercial horticulture production.  A 50% budget increase to &euro;9 million has been secured for 2021, which reflects the importance of the sector and the importance we are placing on it.  The scheme is 100% funded by the Government.  In addition, the Department administers the EU producer organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables, which allows growers to jointly market their production in order to strengthen the position of producers in the marketplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000008#F01800","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1621500600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Like other Members, the Minister of State will have heard the valid concerns about livelihoods in the sector because it is being targeted.

They are not being supported and they feel they have been abandoned.  As a result, there are businesses in my constituency that are now sourcing horticultural peat from Scotland, Estonia and elsewhere.  For a sector that accounts for a minuscule amount of all the peat harvested here, how can the Minister of State say, given the emissions involved in continuously importing an inferior product from abroad, that this is the more environmentally friendly way of moving forward?  We know the suggested alternatives are produced in ways that fall below our environmental standards.

Therefore, the Deputy is correct that there is a necessity to have a just transition to facilitate growers to move away from this growing medium to another more sustainable source.

Therefore, the alternatives to the use of domestic horticultural peat are that we continue to import peat from outside the State, that we export our mushroom industry or that flexibility is shown to allow a sector like that to use domestic peat.  The volume needed for this use is a fraction of what was needed for energy production.

Funding provided to South Dublin County Council in support of the Clondalkin Equine Centre has been the largest capital commitment by the Department in support of an urban horse programme.<\/p> <p>To date the Department has provided funding of almost &euro;560,000, with a further &euro;26,000 made available this year subject to commitments entered into by officials from the Department and the club.  This agreement was in the context of limitations imposed by Covid-19, agreeing further efforts to secure alternative funding and the proposed formulation of a strategy for the organisation.  This funding of &euro;503,000 in 2016 was committed to on the understanding that South Dublin County Council satisfied itself with the rules and governance of the club and that the project, when up and running, would be self-sustaining and assisted with reducing reliance on control of horses' activities.<\/p> <p> This project also committed to the education of horse owners, particularly young horse owners, in the care and welfare of horses, as well as presenting educational and development opportunities for young people.  At the time, the Department made it clear to South Dublin County Council that funding would not be available for the day-to-day running of the club going forward.  To ensure sustainability, the Department worked with the council towards the hiring of a part-time project manager with responsibility for the further development of this horse project and the Department provided funding towards this employment for a time.<\/p> <p> The Department provided further funding in 2019 of &euro;20,000 to the council towards the salary of a full-time manager following a commitment from the club to pursuing alternative streams of revenue.  Earlier this year, following representations and meetings with the club board and management, the Department agreed to provide a final tranche of short-term funding to the project through the council.  The Government is committed to supporting urban horse projects and work is ongoing with other Departments and local authorities to ensure that horses and the young people who care for them receive appropriate support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000009#G01300","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621501800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and acknowledge the funding provided by his Department.

Some of the commentary, certainly not from Deputy Conway-Walsh but from some elements in recent weeks and months, suggesting it was inappropriate and that students should not be claiming the pandemic unemployment payment shows a huge lack of understanding of the impact this pandemic has had on young people and people of all ages.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Conway-Walsh is aware, the student support scheme was established in 2012.  It is a vital support for people accessing third level.  Almost 101,000 applications were received by SUSI for grant support in the 2020 to 2021 academic year with just over 79,000 applications being assessed as eligible for grant support.  The projected total cost for this year is &euro;370 million.  Applications for the 2021 to 2022 academic year are now open and to date we have received 46,000 applications.  I am pleased to say that 28,500 of these applications have now been assessed and 26,500 have been approved for support.  This is an early indication of the very high success rate of people applying and being deemed eligible.<\/p>  <p>  With regard specifically to the pandemic unemployment payment, this has been treated as reckonable income since it was introduced in March 2020.  This is not a new development.  Income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments, such as jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  It is very important there is a consistency of approach for all students.  We cannot decide one student getting one social welfare payment is more or less important or entitled than somebody else.  A student or family on jobseeker's benefit, for example, or on jobseeker's allowance or the one-parent family benefit, must be treated the same as a student for family on the pandemic unemployment payment.  However, I want to say we have a change of circumstance mechanism for students or families who had been receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, and who will not be in future as the economy reopens, to tell the SUSI system there has been a change of circumstance.

If these students were working as normal or under the employment wage subsidy scheme they would be entitled to deduct holiday earnings of &euro;4,500 when applying to SUSI.  At the very least, this deduction should be applied to the pandemic unemployment payment for students.  At a committee meeting, I highlighted to the Minister that I thought it was strange the demand for SUSI this year was in line with 2019 despite the State being in lockdown for much of the year and so many people being out of work.  This only adds up if many other students will be pushed out of qualifying for SUSI because of accepting the pandemic unemployment payment when they lost their employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000012#K00500","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1621503000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>So far, what we are seeing is a significant number of applicants being granted the SUSI grants.

As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said, it gives me an opportunity to expand further on the previous question.  There is a holiday earnings disregard under SUSI of &euro;4,500 in respect of income earned by students outside of term time, for example, the summer period and the Christmas season.  Importantly, this remains available to all SUSI applicants in respect of such earnings.  Students and others may decide to avail of work over the summer period and the income disregard remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  A core principle that underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there has to be a consistency of approach and equitable treatment of students and their families to ensure fair use of the financial resources available.<\/p> <p>This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.<\/p> <p> In being conscious of making sure that we continue to support our students and that we recognise we have lived through extraordinary times, I need to make sure that we are consistent and fair to all students regardless of which social welfare support they may have received over the past year.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is a social protection payment for employees and self-employed people who lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 due to Covid-19 public health emergencies.  Students who lost their employment due to Covid-19 are eligible for the payment.  I am pleased that that is the case.  The PUP payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020.  This is not new.  It has always been reckonable income.  This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection benefits.  We need to be fair.  We need to be equitable, including in how we apply the terms of the holiday income disregard.<\/p> <p> We have received over 46,000 applications.  We have assessed over 28,500.  The number of people who have been assessed as eligible for support is 26,500 - a very high rate.  We are keeping this under close review.<\/p> <p> Most students are assessed based on the family income - the income coming into the house.  Most families and most households in this country have seen their income go down and not up over the course of the pandemic.  I am not yet convinced that this will be a major factor but I will monitor it closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000012#K01100","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621503600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>It may not be a major factor in every case but for the individual cases in which it may be a factor, it could be life-changing.  This is the issue.  My understanding is that there is a &euro;4,500 income disregard applied to any income earned during the period for the SUSI grant applications and students are being advised that income from the PUP payment is not included in the income disregard.  I am asking the Minister that the PUP be automatically included in the income disregard for applicants of the SUSI grant scheme because, as the Minister has repeated, there does not appear to be a huge problem.  However, the Minister must concede that even if it is in one case, it will be life-changing for that individual student.  Given the circumstances that we have all lived through for the past year, it is not worth it for this anomaly to continue to stand over a system that should be more flexible considering the type of industries that students normally work in, such as the hospitality sector and retail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000013#L00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1621503600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>First, we should not say we are standing over a system that we are not yet sure is as the Deputy describes.

For example, if I was to include a PUP payment as an income disregard, why would the Deputy not wish me to include a lone parent's payment as an income disregard, a jobseeker's benefit which is the same principle, or a jobseeker's allowance?  I need to make sure that I do not do anything that is not legal in the first instance and I also need to make sure that I do not do anything that is not equitable.  My approach to this - I say this in a constructive fashion - is to see if the change-of-circumstances mechanism can be flexible and comprehensive and show enough commonsense to work through the individual cases.

I have met a number of students, either studying medicine as graduate entrants or considering doing that.  I am concerned because the argument they would put forward to me is that there is benefit both to the health service and to them as future doctors in having undertaken a degree, perhaps, in the first instance, that is not in medicine.  For example, I met a young man recently who decided to do a science degree and then go into medicine by that route but there is a much increased financial cost should he choose to go that way.  Let me share some of my thoughts on this.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the provision of graduates for the health service through undergraduate and postgraduate provision.  Progression is a key tenet of the SUSI scheme and section 2 of the Student Support Act 2011 defines \"progression\" as \"the process by which learners may transfer from one course to another course where the award that may be made on the successful completion of the second mentioned course is of a higher level.\"  That is the challenge we encounter at present, that somebody entering graduate-entry medicine is entering at the same level as perhaps another undergraduate degree that he or she did.  The student accessing graduate-entry medicine will, as a matter of course, hold a level 8 qualification prior to the entry and completion of a graduate-entry medicine degree confers a further level 8 qualification on that individual.  At present, that is where we are legislatively stuck.<\/p>  <p>  Students pursuing a second degree course are not eligible for free-fees funding or for student grants and, therefore, graduate-entry medicine students have not qualified for these programmes since the introduction of the courses.  However, to widen access to graduate-entry medicine programmes and to assist the students pursuing these programmes, the fees of EU students enrolled in graduate-entry medicine are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  As of the 2020 academic year, the State contribution is &euro;11,524 per graduate-entry student per year and the balance of fees is payable by students.<\/p>  <p>  I will come back on this in a moment to look at some of the mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000013#L00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1621503600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Every year gets more competitive for the Irish student to study medicine and, as the Minister stated, other students begin with another degree and then try to get back in and study medicine.

If it is possible to imagine, this is even more difficult to get into than directly from the leaving certificate.  Fees are approximately &euro;15,000 a year.  That is &euro;60,000 over four years.<\/p>  <p>  There are no Government supports to help students who do not come from wealthy families and the only option is the loan from the Bank of Ireland.  However, I have been contacted by a young man from Limerick who tried to get this bank loan and was told that he needed a guarantor to sign the loan and that the guarantor had to earn at least &euro;50,000 a year.  The young man in question comes from a single-parent household and his mother does not earn more than &euro;50,000 a year.

The second area is that at present they cannot apply for SUSI.  This is a big ask of theirs, as Deputy Conway-Walsh will be aware because she and I have been engaged on this.  There is a review of SUSI that is due to be concluded over the summer months and finally concluded in the autumn.  This is one area that can be looked at as part of that review.  The third area is just to point out to any student that the student assistance fund is available for a student even if he or she is accessing a degree on the same level as already funded.  That might provide some short-term assistance.  I should also point out tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of any fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The first of two other areas I want to examine is SUSI, in the context of the review, and whether there is something we can do there to help.  Second, we are already providing a degree of subsidised fees to the tune of over &euro;11,000 per student per year who goes into graduate entry medicine.  Can we do more in that regard?  They are the two practical areas that people in this House can reasonably ask me to examine.  I am very happy to do that.<\/p>  <p>  From my point of view, as the Minister with responsibility for higher education and skills in this country I can see a lot of merit in the idea that a young student leaving school might wish to do a degree that could benefit him or her later when studying medicine.  In a number of European and other countries across the world it is often the case that the doctor one sees at one's bedside is a fully qualified medical doctor but also has a background in another area.  For example, occupational therapists and scientists in this country have gone on to be doctors.  The pandemic has shown that there is benefit in broadening that base of diversity in learning.

I have undertaken to do two things between now and September, in conjunction with a number of Government colleagues, in particular the Ministers of State, Deputies Josepha Madigan and Anne Rabbitte.<\/p>  <p>  The first thing I want to do is to examine the transition planning for students with disabilities when they leave school.  I have been Minister for Health, as the Deputy knows.  The discussion is often too narrow and concerns what health services a person will be provided with post school, rather than what skills or jobs he or she would like or what college he or she would like to go to.  We are narrowing the conversation and sometimes almost suggesting that an educational journey must end when a person leaves school. <\/p>  <p>  I am doing a piece of work with the Department of Education, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and my Department regarding what I am calling transition planning, career guidance and the like.<\/p>  <p>The second piece we are doing is a mapping exercise.  There are some very good examples of good practice out there.  Next week, for example, I will visit the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities.  It is taking students with intellectual disabilities, and I have met them on a number of occasions already, straight from school and getting them into Trinity College, where they leave with an award and are linked in with employment.  I met the National Learning Network in my constituency, which is also running a number of programmes through the Rehab Group.  There are many examples of good practice which we are mapping out.  By September I intend to report back to the Cabinet committee and, indeed, will be delighted to report back to the House on what more we can do.<\/p> <p> We are developing a new national access plan.  It is due to be developed this year.  We have exceeded many targets in this area, but this is because the targets are under-ambitious.  We are not measuring enough types of disability in that national access plan.  We are out to consultation on it at the moment and will be developing the new national access plan during the course of the year.  We need transition planning, a mapping out of what is there and then a scaling up of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000014#M01400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621504800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>It is most important that there is development and a pathway for people throughout the regions.

It was launched in 2018 but, to date, out of the proposed eating disorder network of eight adult and eight child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams, only three teams have commenced recruitment and are delivering a service.  Two are CAMHS and one is for adults, which is only three out of 16 in three years.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is provided with funding on a yearly basis.  I am told funding is also available this year to progress the recruitment of clinicians, but the HSE has stated: \"The availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in Mental Health services where demand outstrips supply in both the national and international contexts\".  I am told only three adult beds are available, all of which are based in community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6.  Very limited services are available for anyone else affected outside that CHO area.<\/p>  <p> It is recognised that most people can, and do, recover from eating disorders and the most effective treatment is in the community.  The HSE-approved model of care for eating disorders sounds wonderful on paper, but it is based on establishing specialist regional teams with skilled clinicians that will collaborate with hospitals and GPs.

First, there will obviously be a lead-in time for training.  For example, for someone working in psychiatry we are talking about a study period of seven years.  Second, from my Department's point of view, we are ready, willing and standing by ready to help.

The Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 is of high importance to Ireland and the life of the language in this country.

Under the advanced Irish language strategic initiative, funded by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, there are eight courses available in five different institutions.  There were a total of 73 students enrolled in these courses in 2019-20.  Since 2015, 9,286 students have been enrolled in higher education courses on the Irish language or conducted through Irish.

If Northern Ireland was still in the European Union the question would need to be altered.  However, I do take very seriously the point the Deputy makes.

That review is being finalised and I expect to receive it in quarter 2 of this year.  I will be happy to brief the Deputy on that review and debate it in this House.  <\/p> <p> This analysis highlighted the high level of fee support, amounting to more than &euro;500 million annually, composed of funding for tuition of almost 140,000 eligible undergraduate students in higher education.

I worry sometimes when the message goes out about the student contribution fee that people considering accessing higher education may think that every student in the country must pay &euro;3,000.  Nearly half of our students now get their registration fees paid in full or in part under the SUSI grants scheme, and we are reviewing SUSI to ensure that more students are included.  <\/p> <p> The student registration fee, however, is very high and I would like to see it reduced.  It must, however, be done as part of a sustainable funding model.  What we will not be doing is introducing a student loan scheme, such as we have seen in other jurisdictions.

We have seen a withdrawal of the State from higher education.  The third-level institutions are being given 50% less funding per student than in 2008.  That is 72% less, if we account for inflation, and therefore very close to a reduction of three quarters in funding per student.  The facts speak for themselves.  The costs were pushed onto students and families, and fees were increased from &euro;850 in 2008 to &euro;3,000 today.  It is an issue of equality of access.  If we want an equal and fair education system, this barrier must be removed.  Education is a public good, and it must be treated and invested in as such.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great unfairness regarding the contribution fee for those leaving certificate students from last year who found out that their grades had been upgraded in the leaving certificate examinations they sat in November.  They got their results and were again charged that contribution fee.  I ask the Minister to address that point as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000017#P00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1621506000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I tend not to be overly partisan and I do not mean to be overly argumentative, but I think the comparison I made with the situation in Northern Ireland is fair.

The pandemic employment payment, PUP, was made available to students, the student assistance fund was doubled, 15,000 free laptops were provided, there was a &euro;250 top-up to the student grant scheme and the first increase in the postgraduate student supports in a decade.  We have done all this in a Department that is less than one year old.  We want to do much more in this area, but I think we have already shown a significant level of commitment to students.

I want to assure him that like the whole of Government, I am absolutely committed to a significant increase in on-site attendance in the further and higher education sectors in the next academic year.  We all know the reasons why students have had to attend online this year.  They have been well rehearsed and based on public health evidence.  However, we are also aware that it cannot be repeated.  It is not a sustainable situation to be in from an educational point of view, but more importantly, from a well-being perspective.  Our young people, in particular, need to be back in college.  It has been a hell of a long time since first-year students actually had on-site access to education, considering they left school - sixth year - in March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has established a working group.  It includes students, the unions, the representative bodies, NGOs and educational institutions.  The working group will prepare a plan for the new academic year.  It is due to meet again tomorrow to discuss the issue.  I will publish a plan for the new semester in June.<\/p>  <p>  Rapid antigen testing will form a part of that plan, but it is only one part of a package of measures that could support greater on-site activity.  A rapid testing study - pilots, as it were - will be rolled out across four universities this month: TCD, UCC, UCD and NUI Galway.  This will help us learn more about the potential role that rapid antigen can play in the further and higher education sector.  More broadly, perhaps those lessons can also be shared with other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also participating in a HSE antigen testing pilot working group which is working with the HSE on the piloting of antigen testing in the education sector, including at third level.  I am excited about antigen testing and eager to get the rapid testing pilots under way.  They are starting this month.  There is a commitment of funding of over &euro;1 million from my Department.  However, I want to be clear that rapid antigen testing is only one of the tools at our disposal.  The return to campus this autumn is not dependent on such testing.<\/p>  <p>  The adoption of detailed procedures and guidelines encompassing public health advice has played a central role in ensuring that essential and time-critical on-site activity could take place this year.

It is not a criticism of him specifically, but I believe that as a Government, we can do much more.  The dogs on the street know the pros and cons of rapid antigen testing.  It is not as accurate as PCR testing.  We understand that.  However, at the same time, looking at other developed countries, whether it is the UK or across Europe, there are hundreds of thousands of people who are subject to rapid testing every week.  The use of it across the Continent is identifying hundreds of thousands of cases when people are at their most infectious state.<\/p>  <p>  Given that come September the majority of adults here will be vaccinated, please God, in time for universities to return, if there is any delay in the vaccination roll-out it is most likely to affect third level students given that they are from younger age cohorts.

As the Deputy said, rapid testing is not PCR testing.  No one is suggesting that it is.

Examination of relevant issues raised in respect of PhD students arising from the information obtained on current practices will be undertaken by a sub-group of the advisory forum, so we are collating the information and asking the advisory forum to consider it.  We are specifically asking it to look at what happens in Ireland in light of international best practice in this area - how we benchmark what we do with others.

It is at its most acute in the centre of Dublin, however.<\/p>  <p>  I can see the dilemma in my own constituency, particularly for a new younger generation.  We will not leave them behind, we will not leave them out, and we will do everything in our power to make sure they have the ability, as my own and previous generations did, including those in Dublin Bay South, to be able to afford a home.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look after people of all means, incomes and needs, particularly those in inner cities.  The current model is broken.  The market is not working and it will not fix this.  There has to be a radical change and we will help steer that change from within government.<\/p>  <p>  We started by increasing this year's budget by 25% up to &euro;3.3 billion, which I believe is a quarter of the entire capital budget.  We will not stop there.  We will need approximately &euro;120 billion over the next ten years.

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 will be able to help us on climate.  We need to put housing at centre stage and we need all Departments to act.<\/p>  <p>  We increased this year's capital budget, which is the key and real measure of what we can build and do.  We brought in a second measure, however.  I recall in the previous D&aacute;il, we were the first Opposition party that stood up and got cross-party agreement that we needed to switch to cost-rental housing as one of the ways to address this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In this year's budget, we acted and worked with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to say let us make it happen and start straightaway with eight projects we can start building, which are not just theoretical or abstract, and where we are calling from the sidelines, but actually start delivering.  That is only the start.  The reason cost rental is such a part of the solution is that it is social and public housing.  Rather than leased assets that go back to the private sector, the assets stay with our own public assets, on which we can build a long-term, sustainable financing model.  It takes time.<\/p>  <p>  We must be honest with our younger people that they and this housing issue are the first priority.  The benefit of cost rental is that it is in the market.  We can use public lands.  We can actually bring down the rental price.  That combined with affordable housing options, including the use of the serviced sites fund so that we actually reduce the cost, will be critical, particularly for urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  This is not one versus the other.  We particularly need to deliver on our national planning framework, which provides for high-quality homes and housing in urban areas, where people are there for life and have security of tenure.  It is not that the rental sector does not count; it does.  That applies to apartment ownership as well as renting.  We need a variety of different solutions.<\/p>  <p>  The key measures in the coming two months are the development of a new housing for all strategy that delivers on this, within which the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will be key.

We know what the Green Party policy is supposed to be.  It says it wants sustainable, high-quality developments that are located a 15-minute walk or cycle from a city centre.  However, does it only want people to be able to rent this kind of housing, and rent in insecure tenancies?  That is all that is available to people at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance tells us apartments must be omitted from the meagre measures announced this week that purport to stop the bulk purchase of homes by cuckoo funds because they will not otherwise be built.  Fine Gael has said something similar before.  Back in 2017, when Eoghan Murphy was Minister, he said he had to reduce design standards because apartments were too high-spec and were costing too much to build.  He slashed standards for every kind of apartment project but the changes he made for build-to-rent apartments were particularly damaging.  There is no restriction on dwelling mix.  The apartments are smaller and poorly ventilated at a time of a pandemic.  There is a complete lack of storage space, no private outdoor space and they are not at all suited to working from home.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Murphy was pleased with himself when those changes were made.  He claimed at the time he had single-handedly reduced the cost of delivering apartments by 15%.  He should perhaps have been concerned that developers and cuckoo funds were also very pleased with themselves.  Planning permissions in Dublin for apartments now vastly outstrip permissions for houses, and build-to-rent apartments comprise more than 70% of the permissions.  These apartments are cheaper to build, more expensive to rent and impossible to buy, a description that summarises the Government's housing policy very well.  Where are people who live in Dublin supposed to buy homes?  They cannot buy the apartments that are currently under construction because practically every one of them is being purchased by funds.  Eoghan Murphy's bright idea to slash costs for developers and cuckoo funds delivered for neither home buyers nor renters.  All it did was boost developers' profits.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's party, we were told, entered Government to have a positive impact on environmental issues.  I have some questions for him.  Why are he and his party facilitating this planning bonanza for cuckoo funds?  Does he accept that the Government is declaring Dublin city centre a no-go area for first-time buyers?  Is it not the case that young people who want to live in a city centre cannot aspire to home ownership?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000022#U01000","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We have to make housing affordable.  That is agreed and it is achieved by doing.  There is a variety of different investments we have to make.  We need to make significant investment in social housing at volume and at scale.  That involves large numbers and huge amounts of money.  The constraints in that regard are often not necessarily about the financing but getting the building workers with the training and skills, the blocklayers and so on.  We need to avoid the costs going up so much that it is expensive for everyone to build.  We need to do that so that we can build more.  It is about what we agreed the other night in terms of changing the Part V rules to say it is not just 10% social housing but we also want affordable purchase and cost rental.  That is significant.  We need the affordable purchase provision and the likes of the serviced sites fund to help bring down the cost, working with the local authorities.  The local authorities have a central role and we need to work with them on that.<\/p>  <p>  The coming months will be critical because the strategy and the plan have to be changed.  We need to change tack and do better.  The funding has to go in that direction and we will use our influence in government in that regard.  It is difficult because there are loads of funding requirements.  We are going to have to fund health, including Sl&aacute;intecare, education, climate and housing.  It is a challenge to get the balance right but we will fund affordable purchase housing as well as social housing.  I believe cost rental is critical because it fundamentally changes things.  The two tiers we have in Irish housing are around whether it is social or private.  The brilliant thing about cost rental is that it is between the two.  It is in the market but it is public.  I keep coming back to the Land Development Agency and the use of public land because I believe that is the key to help to unlock supply at scale.  I am talking about real ambition.  We are looking to influence, within the Government and with a cross-party approach, access to public lands.<\/p>  <p>  Critical to this, and I have to mention it at every stage because it is crucial it is recognised, is that housing and public transport go together.  To answer the Deputy's question about my vision for Dublin city, it is that we have a 15-minute city.  It will be an accessible city with everything close by and high-quality cycling and walking facilities as well as public transport infrastructure.  That needs to be funded.  There is a huge funding requirement if we are to build the likes of the metro, BusConnects and DART+ for Cork, Galway and Limerick as well as Dublin.  We need balanced regional development to make this work.  It has to include our other cities.  In the development of town centres, village centres and cities we need to go for compact development.  Housing, transport and local environment are key.<\/p>  <p>  We have a real role to offer and provide in terms of getting access to the land and getting an intervention on the sorts of measures I have mentioned.  There will also be private developments and there will be build-to-rent provision.  The &euro;120 billion we need to spend on housing in the next ten years will not all be from the Government.  If it were, we would not have the funding for transport, health and education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000022#U01100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000022#U01200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We need that balance and mix.

The provision of public transport is something that has been highlighted in my constituency, where in the recent past Bus &Eacute;ireann decided to cut back on some of the services it provides between Galway and Limerick.  That service is route 51.  It brings into focus the whole concept of providing public transport and how the National Transport Authority, NTA, which has the vested power to decide on these things, takes decisions to reduce services at a time when we are talking about climate action, bringing in a carbon tax and penalising people who have cars because they must pay more for fuel.  At the same time we are now taking away services from people who would otherwise go to work on these buses, either to Galway or Limerick.  If one takes Gort, Labane or Ardrahan, all of these areas are now affected by in that they do not have the same services they had.  Thus services are not available in the evening for people who want to come from work in Galway or Limerick back to south County Galway.  Likewise, Bus &Eacute;ireann removed bus stops in Kilreekil for no apparent reason, other than it said people were not using them, but we must incentivise people to use public transport.  We must also make it accessible to people with disabilities.  How is this to be changed?<\/p>  <p>  I have spent much time working with Local Link in County Galway, trying to create routes to feed into bus and train services, yet every proposal we put in is turned down by the NTA.  I had very good proposals from the Caherlistrane-Headford area, and from Corrandulla to feed into this, to take cars off the road and get people to go to work on buses.  The public transport is not there; it is not being provided.  People are scratching there heads and thinking that they still need the car and that it is essential.  The message coming from Bus &Eacute;ireann to people in my constituency is that they must continue to use the car even more because the public transport will not be provided.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we look at this when we are talking about climate action.  I know well the Minister wants to deliver on public transport but we must see a plan on how that is going to be done so that in our constituencies we can tell people that this is the service they are going to get.  Public transport is going to take cars off the road.  If we are going to work with that, we need to start now and reverse the decision made by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000023#V00500","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Following on from the previous question, there is a lot of emphasis on urban Ireland because of the issue of apartment living.  We must be very clear that in the changes we need to make, it is about rural and urban.  It is about towns and villages, country and city.  This is particularly the case with meeting the climate change challenges we face where we need a switch to public transport and to reduce the demand to travel by creating services in our towns, so everything is close by and people do not have to travel all the time.  However, as well as the commitment to housing mentioned earlier, this requires a commitment to public transport.  Again, in the context of the Covid crisis, we should look at the figures.  The spending is mainly because of the crisis but it is still an indication this is important.  In 2019, &euro;300 million was spent on subventing public transport.  That increased to &euro;610 million last year and &euro;650 million this year.  The rural bus services are particularly important because as the Deputy said, there are many people who do not have access a car and who have just as much of a right and entitlement to be able to move around, get to the hospital, to other appointments or to wherever they need to go to.<\/p>  <p>  One good bit of news is that I met the commercial bus operators.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also runs these kind of commercial operations with specific supports to keep them going.  I refer not just to the public service obligation, PSO, services but also commercial operators because they were in real difficulty during the Covid crisis.  I met them in recent months.  The support was due to come to an end and they asked that I keep it going for another few months because we are coming to the end of this, lockdown is starting to ease and we do not want to fall at the last hurdle and lose services at the last minute.  I talked to the NTA, as did the industry groups.  I was very glad to commit to extending that into the summer months, so we do not have a cliff edge in support for public bus services.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a key role.  It is true the company is changing the routes, adding some new routes and taking some services from others; it must manage that as it sees fit.  It is also operating these services, the likes of route 51, in a commercial market where there are a lot of private operators as well.  Bus &Eacute;ireann must allocate on the basis of where it sees it can best meet customer demand.  We have given a clear commitment that a reduction in services cannot be done where it leaves people without a commensurate service, be that private or otherwise, so we will not leave people without.<\/p>  <p>  I have another bit of news, which is a positive development.  To take up what Deputy Canney said about Local Link and the need for additional services, recognising that and that we need to change and be more efficient is important, the NTA has been working with Leitrim County Council on a pilot scheme I hope to announce shortly.  It would be for three years and would look at a really innovative way of combining our HSE public transport services with Local Link and bus services so we start developing new rural bus transport services.  Let us not do it the way we always did but look to innovate and try to create new services.  It has not been announced yet but I hope it will be really significant for the people of County Leitrim.  There is potential if the pilot works for it to be spread elsewhere, whereby we increase, enhance and allow the people of rural Ireland make the switch to a better system using public transport in a low-emissions world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000023#V00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and welcome his announcement about the pilot scheme for County Leitrim.  I agree we cannot have more of the same, where there is a mismatch.  We must start with the very basics, look at where the rural populations are, where they are migrating to work, how they are going to work and how they come back home in the evenings.  If Members listen to the AA Ireland traffic reports, they will hear about Claregalway.  Every evening we hear about Bothar na dTreabh in Galway.  The people who are causing the congestion, if I can put it that way, are the workers from the east of the county who are trying to access the city.  We must provide the services so they can access the city in a different way.  Some of the finest private bus operators are operating from east County Galway to bring people into the city.  However, we cannot get a bus lane built from Claregalway into Galway.  It has been planned for maybe the last ten years and still is not done.  It is a very simple process as there is no land acquisition required; it is just a question of getting it done.

They were finding that as soon as they put new routes on, customer demand was rising to meet them; they were on a big expansion plan.  I hope we can get back to that.<\/p>  <p>  A connected issue with respect to what we must do in transport to have a low-emissions future is in our roads programme, which will still be significant.  Our public transport programme will be bigger and be enhanced but it is also important we maintain roads and build new roads to get over where we have pinch points and problems.  As we look at this climate plan, I have been saying that within the roads programme, we must really focus on bypasses of towns, and a large number of them.  They do not have to be big motorways or huge expensive projects.  We can spend our money wisely and have it go further and be spent more widely by doing a whole series of small bypasses.  These will often be single carriageway but they will get traffic out of the bottleneck.

There is no dual aspect for the properties and little communal space or storage.

We need to provide housing for young people and it must be close to the city centre, of high quality and in large numbers.  The strategic housing development approach will not continue after early next year.  It will be wound down and it will mean we will, correctly, have to rely on our councils to get much of this right.  The council must deliver a range of other services, as well as housing, to get the balance right for good quality living.  This means there should be local green space, good bus services, local shops and community centres, as well as work near by.  It is balanced development, which means it is not all housing in one place and work somewhere else.  We want mixed development and we can get it right.<\/p>  <p>  Height is probably the most contentious issue right across the city, particularly now.  We cannot keep going up.  I rely a lot in this regard on the likes of Ciaran Cuffe MEP whom the Deputy will know from the council and who has real planning expertise.  He makes the point that the sense of community weakens slightly when buildings go over a certain height.  This is site-specific and it depends on neighbours, for example.  Costs also go up when heights increase.  There is a balance to be struck.  This might be four, five or six storeys.  Other cities do it, and the likes of Paris and Barcelona, which are historically famous, get the balance right between density and quality.  There is a sense of connection or community that may be lost when we go with some of the really high developments that have been suggested.<\/p>  <p>  We need density, though, and this sometimes requires difficult decisions.  We also need other services that require difficult decisions.  The BusConnects project is on my desk and I hope that can go to planning very shortly.  That will be key in bringing down cost.  For example, we do not need car parking for everyone.  If we thought about this and designed projects well, we could reduce cost of apartments by not having to build expensive and extensive car parking but rather having other solutions to give people a really high quality of life.  We must get that mix or balance right.<\/p>  <p>  This is not easy and no one idea for what we need to do might have more virtue than another idea.  I agree with the Deputy's basic premise.

It is also noticeable when we look at the research statistics that there has been an amazing increase in the amount spent on special needs education in our country, be it on special needs assistants, special teachers or special schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>However, there are gaps and if Dublin 15 is one of these then absolutely we need to close them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>It is very important that we protect every child in the way we manage this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I want to raise the employment of behavioural analysts who, as with other key members of staff in education, are being taken over by the Department of Education and brought into the public sector system.

Yesterday, at the start of my intervention, I welcomed this Bill and I thanked the Minister of State for bringing it forward.  It is good legislation which protects the productive income from the farm or business and that is what is most important.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that if someone has been in care for over three years, once he or she appoints a successor, he or she will no longer have to pay the 7.5% contribution based on his or her asset.  If someone is in care for two years and ten months and appoints a successor, does he or she have to pay just the two months or the entire three years to bring it up to the three-year cap?  I do not know the answer to that question and I hope the Minister of State will clarify this for me in her reply.  I hope it is the latter case.<\/p>  <p>  I want to return to an issue I have spoken about before, which is the increasing challenges being faced by private nursing homes, especially some smaller ones in rural areas.  We are talking about a fair deal, so it has to be a fair deal for everybody.  The average weekly fee in 2018 for public nursing homes was &euro;1,564, whereas it was &euro;968 for private nursing homes.  I recognise in some specific cases, those with more complex needs may be more likely to be cared for in a public nursing home.  Nonetheless, the vast majority of people are being cared for in their locality.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, public nursing homes cost the State 60% more in County Sligo, 68% more in County Leitrim, 70% more in County Roscommon and 81% more in County Donegal.  All nursing homes, public or private, must operate to the same standards and I am not, for one instance, suggesting we pay public nursing homes less, but we have to look at paying private nursing homes more.<\/p> <p>Back in 2015, a review of systems for setting prices under the nursing homes support scheme was set up by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  It was supposed to report back in 2017.  Before Christmas, I asked the T&aacute;naiste why that report had not been published.  I still do not know why, and it still has not been published today.  Why is that?  It seems fundamentally unjust to commission a review of pricing policy in the sector in 2015 and to leave nursing home owners waiting on its recommendations six years later.  It was needed then; it would not have been commissioned if it was not.<br\/><br\/>The truth is that many of those private nursing home owners are barely hanging on.  I have spoken to many of them in my constituency and they are under serious pressure financially.  They cannot compete with the HSE when it comes to terms and conditions for their staff, even though they want to do so because they have top-class staff.  They have difficulty in retaining staff.  If some of those nursing homes close, the State will have to step in, which will mean greater cost to the taxpayer.  Foreign investment is already coming into the sector.  I am not saying it is like the housing sector but there are parallels.  That is not negative in itself but it changes the dynamic.  We need to take a more holistic view of our procurement model and we must never equate value for money with a race to the bottom.  I am not saying that is happening; I am just sounding warning bells.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister of State to publish the review of the systems for setting prices under the nursing homes support scheme.  I have given plenty of anecdotal evidence about the need for that review to be published and acted upon, and I am sure other Deputies will do the same, but I am not just relying on anecdotal evidence.  I have read HIQA's yearly overview reports and what they say is very clear.  The 2017 report notes:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn 2017, five registered providers advised HIQA that they had made a decision to close their nursing home.  The five nursing homes [were] all small centres with less than 40 residents... <\/blockquote> <p>In 2018, HIQA stated that &quot;smaller nursing homes &mdash; which often provide a more homely environment &mdash; are closing voluntarily due to concerns over their financial viability.&quot;  The 2019 report read:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe nursing home sector in Ireland has changed considerably in terms of the size of new centres ... [and many of] these new centres are largely concentrated in the east of the country, particularly in Dublin.  At the same time, smaller centres are closing across the country, presenting a challenge to rural communities.  <\/blockquote> <p>It is happening.  We need a vision for the sector and that vision must be underpinned by the resources necessary to deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000029#EE00400","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621513200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>The traffic in Dublin nearly had me beaten.  I welcome the Bill.  There is one issue I would like the Minister of State to clarify.  My office has been onto her's about it already.  Will people who have been in nursing homes for three to five years so far be covered under the three-year rule straight away when the legislation comes in?  Going by what she has said, they will have to be there three years starting now.  That is a pity because many people in farming and business are financially stretched at the moment and their next of kin are paying large amounts for nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  This is a progressive step forward.  Rural Deputies from all sides have been lobbying for this change for the past four or five years.  It is welcome because it will take pressure off families down the road.  We have to remember that a business or a farm is like a torch for people to hand on.  The situation that had evolved was that someone could have a house worth &euro;1 million somewhere and once the three years were up it would be gone out the window.  However, if that person had a farm or a business, the rate was 7% a year and that kept going for whatever length of time.  It is great that those people were living a good while but the longer they lived another 7% was defrayed and the State would end up owning the farm or the business.  I ask the Minister of State to look again at people who have been in homes for the past three years.  People are paying for their loved ones for eight or ten years and that has put a fair amount of financial pressure on them.  Farming or running a business is not the simplest thing in the world at the best of times and it puts big financial pressure on people but it also keeps them in their community and keeps them in employment.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I would like the Minister of State to look at, and she probably will because we were on a group regarding to it previously, is helping local communities to keep a nucleus of people from the area in one-bedroom or two-bedroom chalets.  That way, one carer or nurse could call to them and they would stay in their communities for as long as possible.  We are well aware that it would not work for everybody but it might help people with Alzheimer's and so on, and new technologies could be used to keep them safe and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the issue of carers and the hours and hours that sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles spend looking after their loved ones in houses around this country.  I have seen people working in Dublin give up their jobs to go down the country to look after their mother or father, and because they had a house here in Dublin, they had to get it assessed and all that craic.  They get damn all, to be quite frank about it.  It would be helpful if we could look at that situation.  I welcome the Bill and I know the Minister of State had a personal interest in it.  I ask her to look at the issues I talked about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000030#FF00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1621513200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I pay tribute and thanks to all the staff and support workers in our nursing homes and community hospitals who have taken care of many of our elderly family members over these difficult and sometimes lonely times during the past year and throughout the pandemic.  These were very difficult times for residents, who were isolated from their loved ones and family members.  The staff provided security, comfort and care to many of our family members.  I am glad that visits have now been restored on a phased basis to those family members we have missed so much.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, which has taken some time to come to fruition.  It was included in both this and the previous programme for Government.  Since the commencement of the nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme as it is more widely known, farmers and small businesses have raised concerns about the charges on their farms or family business assets under this scheme.  Some compared it to the death duties that were abolished decades ago.  Those charges were abolished because families often had to sell the family farm or small business to pay taxes, which left the younger members of the family without an income or a home.<\/p> <p>The family farm or small family business is not used as a capital asset to transfer wealth from one generation to the next, but rather as a means to provide an income for hard work, often undertaken 365 days of the year.  We must remember that according to the IFA only 34% of family farms provide a viable income.  This Bill recognises that fact.  Inheriting a farm is not a road to riches and wealth, but an invitation to work hard for many years to earn enough to provide for one's family and the next generation.  <\/p> <p> The need for a scheme such as this has come about mainly due to improvements in our health services, which has increased life expectancy for all our people.  It was not long ago that average life expectancy in Ireland was in the mid-to-late 60s, but it is now in the mid 80s.  Those born in Ireland today are forecast to have a life expectancy closer to 100 years of age.  The nursing home support scheme, sometimes referred to as the fair deal scheme, is a scheme of financial support for people who need long-term nursing home care.  Under the scheme, a person contributes towards the cost of care and the State pays the balance.  The fair deal scheme represents an annual investment of &euro;1.4 billion by the State and it benefits more than 22,000 people.  <\/p> <p> I am proud to say that the changes included in this Bill were adopted by the Government led by Fine Gael in July 2018, on foot of the proposal from my former colleague, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, former Deputy Jim Daly.  He stated at the time that these changes would take away a great deal of stress and worry from affected families and allow them to plan for the future, while allowing them to continue to run family business without the fear of losing it.  <\/p> <p> I mentioned earlier that this Bill has taken some time to come before the House.  I understand that a review of the scheme was published in 2015 by the coalition Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The review recommended reconsidering how productive assets were dealt with in the scheme.  The process of reforming this scheme has taken more than seven years, and during that time many families have endured extreme hardship in meeting these charges.  Often, they have had to sell parts or all of their family farms, or businesses, which may have been worked on by those families for generations.  <\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State consider setting up a hardship fund that would repay or not levy some of these charges?  I refer to the possibility of it being necessary to sell some farm or business assets to meet these charges and, in that context, the need to ensure these family farms are viable for the next generation.  This Bill addresses possible funding and how charges can be levied for nursing home care in respect of farmers and their spouses.  However, another group at the heart of the scheme should also be considered for special treatment.  Recently, I raised with the Minister of State some concerns from nurses regarding their pay and working conditions, including the Haddington Road agreement and registration charges.  No one doubts that nurses were on the front line and carried out sterling work in the last year when providing treatment during the pandemic.  They are also at the very heart of the nursing home care system.  There is consensus among people that nurses are undervalued and underpaid in our health system.  There is also a similar consensus that they played a vital role in the treatment of many of our elderly people during the worst days of the pandemic.  <\/p> <p> There is a belief that the Trojan efforts and contributions of nurses must be recognised and rewarded.  While I understand the complications and knock-on effects associated with giving a special pay award, I suggest that we might be able to examine other factors in respect of their pay and conditions of employment.  One possibility might be for us to examine the possibility of offering a special deal to nurses.  I would love to think that we could introduce amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage to provide for a special treatment package under the nursing home support scheme for nurses who have worked so hard during this pandemic.  One potential proposal would be to look at the three-year rule for charging.  It might be possible to change that criterion to a two-year charge for the first year.  However, that is only one potential method that could be applied.  The Minister of State and her advisers may be able to come up with some other package to demonstrate our nation's gratitude to all nurses who have worked on the front line during this horrific pandemic.  I support this Bill and I hope the Minister of State and her advisers might take on board some of my suggestions, as well as amendments, on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000030#FF00300","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621513800,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We have all seen how challenging Covid-19 has been for older people, those living on their own and people living in nursing homes.  Nursing homes are at the heart of their respective communities, meeting the vital healthcare requirements of a cohort of our society during a difficult time in their and their families' lives.  Nursing homes are very much a home away from home and a safe place in which loved ones can be cared for.  The major increase in our older population will present big challenges for our healthcare services within our regions.  It is crucial that public investment in long-term care services is maintained for those who need it.<\/p>  <p>  Care must remain accessible and affordable, including for those families with a farm or business.  I have been saying for a long time that the fair deal scheme needed to be fairer, and now it is.  I met many farming families who told me of their concerns regarding how they were assessed.  I welcome the fact that after three years the value of family-owned farms will no longer be considered when calculating the cost of care for people in nursing homes, where a family successor commits to working on the farm or in the business and allowing them to be passed down to the next generation.  That is an important point.  Farming is part of our history and culture, and in that context we must ensure that we get this legislation right.  I am delighted with this Bill because it will protect our family farms and businesses.  By inserting additional safeguards to the scheme, the Bill will promote and protect the sustainability of family farms and businesses.  It will ensure they are not consigned to the history books.<\/p>  <p>  Updating the nursing home support scheme legislation to enhance protection for farmers and business owners was an absolute priority for the Minister of State and I applaud her for her work.  This legislation has been her priority since she became a Minister of State, and especially in recent months.  I have spoken with her several times and I know she has faced many obstacles, but this is a really good Bill and it is good for our farmers and businesses.  This is what we must do to protect the most vulnerable in our society.  The Minister of State shares my desire to find ways to support and enable older people to live in their own homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible.  In that context, this again is a great Bill and I support it.  However, we all know we must do more when it comes to achieving the goal of finding better ways of enabling our population to stay at home while ageing.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been speaking to families and many of them would like to have their elderly parents in their homes.  This aspect is a priority for the Minister of State, and we must look at more supports in that regard, including more funding and full-time care.  It is a matter for another day, but I ask the Minister of State to examine that area as well.  We are lucky that people are living longer.  It is great to see that happening.  My mother at home is 86 and my sister is her carer.  We are so lucky.  They have had all their vaccines now as well, which is great.  I got my vaccine yesterday, and I am delighted.  Things are changing.  <\/p>  <p>  I compliment everybody involved in nursing homes.  It has been such a difficult time.  The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been very hard on nursing homes, but they have been absolutely brilliant.  We must express our thanks to all those involved for what they have done for elderly people.  It is important that we do that.  We appreciate all that has been done and we must show that.  Life is precious, and if we have learned anything from Covid-19 it is that we must make the best of what we have and try to work with, be kind to and look after people.<\/p> <p>It is the Minister of State's role, as she has responsibility for older people, to put their needs first.  I thank her for that.<\/p> <p> We have discussed the issue of rental income in respect of the fair deal scheme.  That is an issue for another day.  <\/p> <p> This Bill is to be welcomed.  I have spoken to many family farmers in my own area of Carlow and they are delighted with this Bill.  They feel that they have been waiting a long time for it.  Indeed, it has been in the pipeline for some time.  Now it is here.  This Bill shows that we, in Fianna F&aacute;il and in government, are committed to looking after our older people.<\/p> <p> I have only question left for the Minister of State.  What is the timescale with the Bill?  I am delighted that many of the parties are supporting the Bill.  As it is such an important Bill, I am wondering about the timescale.  It is important that we try to get it through the House as soon as possible.  Perhaps the Minister of State can write to me, providing me with details of a timescale and how long the process will take.  I urge the Government and all Members to get this legislation through the House as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> I wish to thank everyone involved, including the Department and the Minister of State, for putting such hard work into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000031#GG00200","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621514400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  It aims to limit the period for including the value of family farms or businesses to three years for financial assessment under the fair deal scheme, where the family successor continues to operate the farm or business for six years and takes over the running of the farm or business within three years.  It is, indeed, a welcome reform.<\/p><p>However,  it is a real shame that the Bill does not address some of the other issues with the scheme that I and others have been highlighting for several years.  For a number of years, I have sought to find a way to stop the double charging of residents of private nursing homes for items and services to which they are entitled as medical card holders.  This practice goes on in many nursing homes where elderly residents or their families have to pay for items as basic as wound dressings, certain medications, sanitary products and services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  If these residents were living in the community, these would be provided free of charge under the medical card scheme.  The legislation states that this should not happen, but in practice, residents have to sign contracts that include clauses allowing nursing homes to charge them for these items and services.  These residents need the nursing home care; they have no choice but to sign the contract.  I have highlighted this matter repeatedly to the Government, but it has failed to address it or even to acknowledge that it is a serious problem for some people who have to pay enormous bills for items that should be provided free of charge.<\/p><p>That is only one issue that needs to be addressed.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I know only too well that there are significant shortcomings in how the fair deal scheme is run.  Last October. we raised the fact that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which decides what price nursing homes will charge patients in private and voluntary nursing homes, had <i>ad hoc<\/i>and inconsistent record keeping, which meant that the process was not transparent in some cases.  We know that the maximum price decided upon for a patient's care is always the actual price.  That is not acceptable.<\/p><p>We also know that when some assessments are done, the process of checking when properties and other assets were signed over to family members is not thorough, meaning that people who hastily sign over assets a year or two before they join the scheme often do not pay the correct amount as the scheme is unaware of the actual value of assets they owned.  <\/p><p>We also know that some private nursing homes will not accept certain high-dependency residents, particularly those who are very unwell, or have significant impairments.  The public nursing homes often look after these residents, which places an unfair burden on them.<\/p><p>We have been told that some of these are being addressed and the committee will continue to work on these issues.  However, I have seen no evidence that any of these issues have been addressed.  <\/p><p>I hope that this Bill is only a first step in addressing some of the problems with the fair deal scheme, as a huge number of people rely on it.  It has to be fair and work for as many people as possible.  <\/p><p>I take issue, in particular, with the charging of residents who are in possession of a medical card for items and services.  If they were living in the community, they would be entitled to those products, medicines and therapies free of charge.  However, because they are in private nursing homes and have signed contracts, they are being charged.  If the residents cannot afford to pay, their families must pay.  I came across a family facing a bill of almost &euro;1,500 for a one-year period.  That is unfair.  The resident in question was entitled to all of the items for which the family was being charged under the medical card scheme.  If there is one issue that I ask the Minister of State to tackle from today onwards, it is that.  It is wrong. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000032#HH00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1621514400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I also wish to welcome this Bill.  It is a resolution of sorts to what has been fundamental unfairness in the so-called fair deal scheme.  It has affected farming families, in particular.  In capping the contributions at three years as they relate to family farms, the scheme now essentially reflects the reality that in many cases, family farms are extensions of the family homes rather than a speculative asset that is hoarded or treated as a business or other type of asset.  That is most important.<\/p>  <p>  My regret, which I believe is shared by many in this House, is that we are so late in bringing the legislation to this point.  My fundamental regret is that the people who have highlighted this anomaly and campaigned for changes in the legislation will not get the benefit of it.  Those people who have been in nursing home care for more than three years will not receive a rebate.  I appeal to all parties to work as hard as possible and explore every avenue with a view to finding a legal basis by which the issue can be resolved so that those people can get their payments back.  Undoubtedly, if that is not the case, farm holdings will be lost to families who simply do have the resources to pay the nursing home care bill.<\/p>  <p>  While the resolution makes the fair deal scheme fairer, it still does not make it an entirely fair deal.  In bringing this Bill to Committee Stage, I urge all parties to reflect on the stories that we have heard from our constituencies and ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>  <p>  It is a good opportunity for us to reflect on how we deal with legislation that comes before the House, particularly from Departments that may not have an explicit responsibility for rural communities.  The difficulty with the original legislation is that it was adopted without any consideration as to what it might mean for farm families.  We are only now getting to the point where that is being addressed.  The Deputies will be aware that Sinn F&eacute;in has been trying to pass what is referred to as \"rural equality legislation\" in this House since 2015.  Most recently, the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy for the Roscommon-Galway constituency, Deputy Kerrane, brought legislation before the House that is designed to essentially ensure that every Bill passed is \"rural-proofed\", for want of a better term.  It involves assessing what the legislation might mean, and what its implications might be, for the rural communities that we know are struggling in many ways.  In the past, this legislation has been opposed by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I encourage Members to work with us to ensure that that Bill can be brought through this House and passed to make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>  <p>  I also support Deputy Munster's call for focus to be placed on addressing anomalies in nursing home care.  We need to move to a point where we actually have publicly-provided nursing home care.  Just like all other forms of healthcare, nursing home care should not be driven by motivations of profit; rather it should be considered to be a fundamental part of our healthcare system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000032#HH00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621514400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Situation in Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel: Statements","time":1621515000,"counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000033#JJ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1621515000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Carroll MacNeill.<\/p><p>We are here this afternoon to address the current cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.  It is the latest in a long, brutal and inhumane conflict that has taken an unspeakable human toll.  This week, I have spoken about the situation in the Seanad, at the UN Security Council and in a meeting of EU foreign ministers.  I repeat here my calls for an immediate cessation of violence.  Indiscriminate rocket attacks from Gaza must stop.  Israeli air strikes must stop.  Over 120 civilians in the Gaza Strip have been killed in the last ten days, 63 of them children.  Among the 12 civilians killed in Israel, two were children.  This is shameful and will reinforce and embed hatred, grief and a continuance of what drives this conflict into the future.  Today, as we debate in this Chamber, 57,000 people have been displaced by hostilities in Gaza and are now taking refuge in almost 60 schools, many of them UN facilities, in an effort to find safe refuge for themselves, their families and their children.  The protection of civilians must be paramount.  The impact on civilians, particularly children, has been simply unacceptable and the international community must call it out.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I spoke to the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Shtayyeh, and expressed Ireland's condolences on the deaths and violence of the past week.  Ireland has been urging the UN Security Council to use its voice.  The council has met four times since the outbreak of hostilities.  I must be honest that I find it difficult to comprehend how the UN Security Council has not yet been able to agree a clear joint statement on this issue.  The global structure for preventing conflict and bringing conflict to an end has been unable until now to call for a ceasefire on a conflict as significant as this one.  I addressed the UN Security Council on Sunday and underlined that we need to send a clear and united message that the council and its members have a responsibility to speak.  Ireland is working closely with France on intensive negotiations in New York today to agree a Security Council resolution.  I will be meeting later this afternoon in Dublin with my French counterpart on this issue.  I sincerely hope that all council members will come to the table constructively to try and reach agreement.  The UN Security Council must speak on this issue.<\/p><p>The President of the UN General Assembly has also convened the General Assembly today.  This reflects the widespread concern among UN member states.  The conflict is of particular concern to neighbouring states, many of which have been at the forefront of efforts to try to secure a ceasefire in recent days.  I have been in close contact with my counterparts in the region, be it in Egypt, Qatar or Jordan.  I have urged all states to use their influence with parties to support efforts to end hostilities.  Yesterday, I met the Foreign Minister of Iran, Mr. Zarif.  I made the point clearly to him that Iran has a responsibility to use its influence in the Gaza Strip to insist on a ceasefire and an ending of violence and the firing of rockets.  EU foreign ministers met virtually on Tuesday in an emergency setting.  I called for a clear EU message in support of an immediate ceasefire and for humanitarian access to Gaza.  I welcome the clear call from the High Representative, Mr. Josep Borrell, for a cessation of violence, for the implementation of a ceasefire in order to protect civilians and for full humanitarian access to be given to those most in need in Gaza.<\/p><p>Beyond securing a ceasefire and humanitarian access, we must also address the root causes of this ongoing cycle of violence.  I was clear about this at the Foreign Affairs Council on Tuesday.  The EU has a responsibility to step up.  This is in our neighbourhood and we must be a much more influential actor than we are currently.  As I said, this afternoon I will meet my French counterpart, Mr. Jean-Yves Le Drian.  We will discuss how we can work together at both EU and UN Security Council levels to support all efforts to de-escalate and, looking ahead, how we can reinvigorate the international community's commitment to the Middle East peace process and restart badly needed negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians on the basis of equality of esteem, which we have not seen for a number of years.<\/p><p>The loss of life, destruction and trauma we have seen in the last week across Israel and Palestine have been horrifying, but must be a wake-up call for the international community in terms of its responsibilities.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the Gaza Strip, where 2 million people were already living in acute humanitarian need and suffering the consequences of repeated cycles of violence and long-running blockades.  That is why I have announced an immediate response of &euro;1.5 million in emergency supports for the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip.  Irish Aid will support the UN in delivering emergency humanitarian supplies to those who most need them.  Some &euro;1 million will be provided to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, which provides services to Palestinian refugees, for emergency food, water and sanitation supplies and health and psychosocial services for 50,000 people sheltered in UNRWA-run schools.  The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, will also receive &euro;500,000 for child protection and medical and sanitation services for thousands of children in acute need.  This includes emergency psychosocial services to 5,000 children suffering trauma as a result of hostilities.  We will respond further to the humanitarian situation in the weeks ahead.  This money is additional to the money we already provide to organisations such as UNRWA and other UN actors.<\/p><p>While much of the focus today is rightly on the violence and tension in Gaza, the West Bank and across Israel, we cannot and must not shy away from the enabling factors in this recent tragic cycle of violence.  I have to say that they are primarily Israel's continued strategy of expanding settlements and the discriminatory practices by Israeli authorities against Palestinians, with forced relocation, demolition of properties, forced evictions and continuing to expand settlements that are not legal in the first place.  Once the immediate hostilities have ended, we cannot go back to the <i>status quo<\/i>of a few weeks ago.  I remain supportive of a two-state solution, but it cannot be delivered if Israel&rsquo;s actions on settlements, demolition and evictions continue unabated.  Brutality and dispossession will not lead to a peaceful, secure outcome for anyone, either for Palestinians in a future state of their own or for Israelis who want to live in peace with their neighbours as well.<\/p><p>Ireland will continue to use its voice at the Security Council to draw attention to these issues.  We will speak up even if it is not comfortable to do so.  We will continue, along with our EU partners, to engage in renewed and reinvigorated international and regional efforts, which are more necessary now than they have been for many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000033#JJ00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1621515000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for sharing his time.

Homes, media offices, libraries, police stations, a university, nine primary healthcare centres, six hospitals, the main Covid-19 laboratory and the office of the ministry of health have been deliberately destroyed.  Those are all grave breaches of the Geneva Convention or, in other words, war crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Like all witnesses, we face the challenge to act under our moral obligation to attempt to put an end to this onslaught or to retreat into the role of passive observer.  The Irish Government has adopted an approach that perhaps can be best described as straddling the two in its attempt to achieve consensus that has no chance of success.  The deck is stacked.  All attempts to achieve consensus are doomed to failure when allies of Israel cynically employ their veto at the UN and within the EU to prevent anything that could resemble a coherent approach emerging.  Thus, we are morally, ethically and justifiably compelled to act unilaterally.<\/p>  <p>  In the dark days of South African apartheid, Ireland, spurred by the passion of the ordinary people of Ireland as epitomised by the Dunnes Stores strikers, was proud to act in support of the victims of state oppression and discrimination in South Africa.  What has changed?  Human Rights Watch, an internationally respected organisation, recently laid the accusation of the crime of apartheid against the Israeli state, an allegation backed by the most irrefutable of evidence.  The Government of Israel has been engaged in a systematic campaign of absolute domination over the Palestinian peoples for decades.  Human Rights Watch, along with reports from other human rights groups such as Al-Haq and B'Tselem, have called this out now, which is welcome.  However, the reports, in conjunction with the latest round of attacks on the Palestinian people, must be seen as a catalyst for action.<\/p>  <p>  The current violence is not taking place in a vacuum.  It is the product of 54 years of Israeli colonisation of Palestine.  Since 1967, 250 illegal Israeli settlements have been created on Palestinian lands, now inhabited by more than 650,000 illegal Israeli settlers.<\/p> <p>This is an Israeli strategy of remove, fragment and replace, designed to allow Israeli settlers to seize the maximum amount of Palestinian land for themselves while locking the remaining Palestinian people into a patchwork collection of Bantustans.  This is apartheid in practice.<\/p> <p> It is a fact that 83% of all demolitions of Palestinian buildings take place within a 2.5 km range of Israeli settlements.  When I say buildings, I am describing homes, schools, health centres and basic critical infrastructure funded by the Irish taxpayer and other donors.<\/p> <p> In 2020, 848 Palestinian homes were destroyed, impacting on 6,380 Palestinians, including 534 children.  Up to 30 April this year, 316 buildings were destroyed.  This represents an increase of 108% on figures from 2020.<\/p> <p> The human cost of this is catastrophic.  Thousands are left homeless, hopeless, and destitute.  Very often, following the destruction of schools, young children are forced to travel 14 to 15 miles to schools, during which they often have to pass by the illegal Israeli settlements.<\/p> <p> It is time for action.  We can issue all the statements we want.  The statements that have been issued would plaster the walls of the convention centre but it has zero impact on the illegal aggression by the Israeli state.  We can and must take action.  Ireland must be prepared to act alone on this when the international community has failed the Palestinian people.<\/p> <p> We must officially recognise the Palestinian state.  We must also move to bring forward the occupied territories Bill and recognise the fact that annexation is happening as we speak in East Jerusalem and in the occupied West Bank territories.  We must act, and if that means acting unilaterally, we must do so, otherwise, we are failing on our human rights and our obligations to the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000034#KK00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621516200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Gaza is a tiny enclave 41 km long and 11 km at its widest point.  It has endured a military and economic blockade since 2007, effectively imprisoning almost two million people in an area the size of 362 sq. km.<\/p>  <p>  For almost two weeks now, this third most densely populated spot in the world has been under sustained and shocking bombardment by one of the best armed military forces on the planet.  We know that at least 230 Palestinians are dead, including 65 children, which I read as I came into the Chamber.  The rockets launched by Hamas against Israel have killed ten people, including two children, and two other Israelis have also died in civil unrest.<\/p>  <p>  The scenes emerging on our televisions have horrified all right-thinking people.  We expect a ceasefire to be agreed, particularly after the intervention of the US President, Joe Biden, this week.  We also know, however, that actual ceasefire will not come about until the Israeli military is satisfied that it has bombed and destroyed every target it wishes to.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister said, a ceasefire is and must be our first priority.  The first thing we must achieve internationally is to stop the killing, but what then?  Do we refocus on other issues until the next flare-up of violence or do we seek now to join anyone willing to join us in taking a stand?<\/p>  <p>  The international community has an understood settlement for the Israeli-Palestinian disagreement, which is two separate sovereigns states, Israel and Palestine, both with sustainable and viable territories and borders, sharing Jerusalem as their capital.  On occasions in the 1990s, this objective was thought to be within our grasp.  Now, it has been systematically undermined by years of Israeli settlement in Palestinian territories.  It has been undermined to the point that many academics and politicians alike have despaired of its implementability.  The viability of a Palestinian state is now in question because of the obvious policy of Israel to dismantle it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has sought to build a common position internationally, on which I commend him, at the United Nations, where the United States prevents any consensus emerging in the Security Council, and in the EU, where countries like Hungary prevent a common position emerging.  So be it; it is time for Ireland to act.<\/p>  <p>  During last week's Priority Questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I said there must be a consequence for the outrageous actions we see, which assault human rights and all international norms, and not the normal verbal condemnations but concrete actions.<\/p>  <p>  Today, Norway's sovereign wealth fund dropped two companies that were involved in the development of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are called Shapir Engineering and Industry Ltd. and Mivne Real Estate KD Ltd.<\/p>  <p>  We, too, must take a lead in meaningful economic sanctions aimed at any company, individual or state entity that violates international law by supporting or facilitating illegal settlements.  The rights and legal entitlements of an entire nation cannot simply be extinguished by a sustained, deliberate and relentless policy of dispossession, eviction and suppression.<\/p>  <p>  The only hope for long-term and sustainable peace, as we in Ireland know only too well, is to provide a basis for both communities to coexist, with equal rights, as citizens of two separate nations.  The real security rightly sought by the people of Israel can only be guaranteed when an acceptable settlement, not one forced by strength of arms, is mutually agreed by both sides.  I believe the people of Ireland want their Government and their Parliament to act now to build the international pressure to bring this about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000035#LL00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins is sharing time with Deputy Cahill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000035#LL00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516200,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I wish to begin by condemning the violence in Palestine and Israel.  I have stood in the West Bank and in places like Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah.  I have crossed the border at Kulandia and gone through the checkpoint alone in the darkness of night.<\/p>  <p>  I stood in Hebron during Passover when hundreds of heavily armed Israeli soldiers burst out from a military zone into a Palestinian town.  I watched helplessly as those Israeli soldiers banged on the doors of Palestinian homes, gained entry into people's houses and illegal access onto the roof in order that their snipers could, from afar, police what was going on below.  And why?  To watch over a religious tour to a holy site in a Palestinian town.  We estimated there were eight Israeli soldiers for every one of those tourists.<\/p>  <p>  I recall standing on a side street in Hebron under a caged roof that was burned through in places by acid thrown down from the settlement.  I remember standing there and counting seven snipers who were aimed at me and my cousin, who worked for a NGO in Palestine.  The tension, fear and intimidation is something I will never forget.<\/p>  <p>  The difference between those Israeli soldiers and soldiers I have come across elsewhere in the world is that I knew instinctively they were not there to protect me or the people around me.<\/p> <p>They were there to protect a certain faction of society and to hell with who got caught in the crossfire.  It is easy to get caught up in the legalities, the legislation and the big news stories about what is going on right now, but this is what is happening in Palestine and, in fact, it is a million times worse in Gaza.  People are living in fear and hopelessness and that is absolutely wrong.<\/p> <p> There are no simple answers.  If there were, they would have been found by now.  However, that does mean we can give up.  We must continue to use our position to find a path to a peace process and a credible solution.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been very clear that much of what is happening in the occupied Palestinian territories is against international law.  Expanding settlements is illegal.  Demolishing the homes of Bedouins is illegal.  Forced evictions in East Jerusalem are illegal.  All of these actions have contributed to rising tensions in an already tense region.  It is up to us and countries like us to stand up for the people who are caught in the crossfire.  We must use our platform on the UN Security Council to find a path to lasting peace and put an end to people dying needlessly every day, children dying because of a war that has been going on since before they were born, families being torn apart and communities being destroyed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000035#LL00400","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Over the past week, the Irish people have shown both their generosity of spirit and their care for global human rights in their response to the human rights violations against the Palestinian people.  Due to our colonial history, we have a strong affinity with the Palestinians and the Government must honour that connection.  First, it is important to look at recent events not in isolation but as examples of how Palestinians are treated on a daily basis.  The current escalation began when the Israeli authorities attempted a forced removal of Palestinians from their homes in neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem.  This attempted eviction is still ongoing.  It is important to remember that the families at risk of eviction are descendants of those who were made refugees when the state of Israel was created in 1948.  They will more than likely be made refugees again.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.  In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the Israeli authorities demolished, forced people to demolish or seized at least 292 Palestinian-owned structures across the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, thereby displacing 450 people, including 246 children.  According to the UN, this constitutes a 121% increase in the targeting of structures and a 126% increase in the number of people displaced, compared with the same period in 2020.  As of 2019, the estimated that Israel had razed 49,532 Palestinian structures.<\/p><p>These demolitions are further compounded by the increase in Israeli settlements, which have ramped up over the past number of years.  Between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, there are now nearly 600,000 settlers.  Settlements are strongly linked to the demolitions that have occurred, as each house demolition takes place strategically, with the aim of making way for more settlers.  The largest settlement has 80,000 people in it, which is exactly the same population as Galway city.  A settler who arrives in the West Bank or East Jerusalem from any place around the globe has more rights than a Palestinian who was born and bred there.<\/p><p>We all know the result of Israel's bombing of Gaza.  At least 65 children are dead, media buildings have been destroyed, one of Gaza's few neurologists was murdered and whole families have vanished.  Are we really meant to believe Israel when it says it is only targeting terrorists?  No one here supports the firing of rockets into civilian areas in Israel but the truth is the truth and the wider context matters very much.  For a prolonged period, we have witnessed a sustained attack on the right of Palestinians to exist.  A Palestinian life seems to be worth less than that of most others around the globe.<\/p><p>The people of this country are demanding action.  We have two options before us.  First, the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 represents a real step that we can take.  It would ban exports from arriving into this country from illegal settlements and would apply to any occupied territory in the world.  The second option is full recognition of the Palestinian state.  That is something for which previous Governments have expressed support and we should not be waiting for permission to do it.\u00a0 It is easy to dismiss either of these measures as token gestures but the occupied territories Bill received global coverage for its potential to act as a model for other nations.  The brutality of Israel's actions in Gaza has rallied global solidarity like never before.  Even in the USA, many Democratic Party politicians have found their voice.  We have a decision to make.  Do we want to be on the right side of history and be the leader we can be, or do we want to play it safe?\u00a0 Israel should have a right to safety, but so should Palestinians.  I hope we can play our part in ensuring that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Cronin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I understood I was sharing time with Deputy McAuliffe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00400","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>There is no time left in that slot, according to my list.

They are a dignified change from those of his predecessor during the assault on Gaza in 2014.  Strong words are necessary from Ireland, a country that was occupied and knows the cosh of the coloniser.  This week, Gaza is awash with anguish.  There are reports that 60% of electricity lines are down.  Water pipes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing and tens of thousands of people have no access to clean drinking water.  A M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res clinic has been destroyed, Red Crescent operations are severely disrupted and a Covid testing laboratory was wiped out.  Some 48,000 people are crammed into schools, which the UN hopes will be protected this time by the blue flags flying overhead.  That is not always the case.<\/p>  <p>  There are reports of families sleeping together in one room so that, if they are bombed, they will die together.  In the rubble of their home, a brother and sister found their pet goldfish.  In the rubble of his home, Riyad Eshkuntana was not so lucky.  His wife and four of his children were killed.  Only his daughter Suzy was pulled alive from the wreckage of their home, now the wreckage of their lives.  Suzy is six years old.  Her younger brother Yehya was four.  Yet Israel tells the world it is targeting armed terrorists.  As I wrote this speech, I had to keep updating the number for the deaths of children.  In Israel, there were two.  In Gaza, 40 became 50, 50 became 60 and we are now at 65.  Eleven of those children were receiving trauma counselling when they were killed.  Yet Israel claims it is the victim as the normal service of evicting, settling, displacing, degrading, threatening, annexing, arresting, shooting and beating turns with depressing regularity to bombing.  In this perverse logic, condemning the razing of Palestine and its people is deemed anti-Semitic.  It is not.  Nor is condemning the Israeli Government for its excessive force and its murder of children.  Likewise, the descendants of Holocaust survivors protesting Israel's violence against the Palestinians is not anti-Semitic.<\/p>  <p>  The Kildare bard, Christy Moore, sang: \"[They] tell us who suffer the tear gas and the torture that we're in the wrong.\"  The Palestinian people are in the wrong in shelters, on the beach, in schools, in trauma counselling and in what they hoped, like Riyad Eshkuntana, were safe spaces.  They are in the wrong in childhood.  I say to the terrified people of Gaza today that as a country that knows occupation, Ireland is with them in heart, soul and spirit.  Four years ago, on the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War and the capture of Palestinian lands, the Israeli conductor and peacemaker, Daniel Barenboim, warned Israel that its occupation had \"eroded all sense of decency and humanity and morality from people like me, who had been persecuted for over 20 centuries\".<\/p>  <p>The tide is turning and the world is watching.  The Minister should tell his partners on the UN Security Council, that, as was said by my leader Deputy McDonald earlier, we see them.  We see them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00800","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621517400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>In an ideal world there would always be time for diplomacy, a time to temper our language and talk of peace.  However, when children are being bombed in their homes and in their beds, there should be a time to tell the truth.  The truth is that what is happening in Gaza at the minute is a massacre.  Diplomacy is failing when children are bombed in their homes.  Now is the time for plain speaking, to not equivocate in our condemnation, to not equivocate in our language and to not create a false impression of \"both sides-ism\".  Now is the time to call this for what it is.  This situation, the Israeli annexation of Palestinian lands, is an annexation.  There are evictions, there is the bulldozing of homes and there is displacement on a massive scale: it is an annexation.  Now is the time to call out the apartheid and the persecution of the Palestinian people on their own lands for just that: a form of apartheid and a persecution of the Palestinian people.  The international organisation Human Rights Watch took that decision over the last number of weeks.  It has the full support of many within the international community and the Government would do well to follow suit.<\/p>  <p>  Now is the time to call the leaders and the perpetrators of this massacre, this annexation, what they are: warlords.  In particular, the Israeli Minister for Defence campaigned in 2019 on his warlord credentials, and on what he carried out on the people of Gaza in 2014.  This is an old tactic of people who create the idea of an enemy at the gates and present themselves as the only one who can fend them off.  They dehumanise, they create an impression of being constantly under attack and then they present themselves as being the only ones who can save the populace.  The massacre happening in Gaza as we speak will be used to prop up these warlords in elections to come.<\/p>  <p>  When we hear talk of terrorism, we should remember that terrorism has many forms.  Terrorism, as we know it in the post-9\/11 world, comes from terrorists in caves and terrorists firing rockets but terrorism has another form too.  I speak of state-sponsored terrorism, state-aided terrorism and state-enacted terrorism.  We hear of, and I mentioned, children being bombed in their beds in Gaza as if these children were asleep.  These children could not have been asleep, they would simply have been too terrified.  As Deputy Cronin mentioned, 11 of the 65 children killed were undergoing trauma counselling.  That is a form of state-enacted terrorism against children and we should call it what it is.<\/p>  <p>  When we speak of the truth we should also talk about how we act.  The Government has a responsibility to take action and the people demand we take action.  We have a number of options open to us in that regard.  There is a mandate in this Chamber for the passing of the occupied territories Bill.  The Irish people have a proud tradition of boycotts.  Boycott was a weapon of the weak used against the strong throughout our traditions and it is something we can enact in this Chamber by means of that Bill, to say no more will we trade in or do business with the Israeli occupation and annexation of Palestinian lands.  There is legal argument and dispute but I argue strongly in favour of having those legal arguments out on Committee Stage.  Let us bring it through.  Everybody in this Chamber is acting with good intentions, be they in the Government or the Opposition, but there is a bulwark in the form of one particular party and one particular Minister against bringing the occupied territories Bill to the floor of this Chamber and letting it be debated.  Now is the time to act.  We cannot be equivocating in our language; we cannot be equivocating in our actions.  Our diplomacy is failing.  Now is the time to recognise the Palestinian state.  Now is the time to recognise we all have a responsibility to be brave.  We can take actions in this Chamber that will have ramifications around the world.  We did it by not handling goods from apartheid-era South Africa and we can do it again.  To not do so would be the utmost form of cowardice.

I want to step back and look at the root causes of the onslaught we are witnessing on television.  As another Deputy said already, the spark that ignited the current flame was the attempt by the Israeli Government to confiscate homes and to expel Palestinians living in occupied East Jerusalem.  This was an action of annexation.  It was a deliberate action inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in East Jerusalem.  This is what we have been witnessing and what has been going on, not just in East Jerusalem but across the West Bank.  We are dealing with an occupation and a de facto annexation, and we need to start calling it that.  When the Minister was here taking a Topical Issue debate the other day, he spoke about Irish diplomacy preventing the annexation of the Jordan Valley.  That may be a <i>de jure<\/i>annexation but we are witnessing a de facto annexation in East Jerusalem and across the West Bank, and it was the spark that caused the current flame.  That annexation is rooted in the illegal occupation that has been going on since 1967.  That occupation has lead to the annexation but also to all the other things we have heard about today, including the brutality of the occupying soldiers as witnessed by Israeli NGOs like Breaking the Silence, the demolitions, the dispossessions, the checkpoints, the ID cards, the restriction on movement, the restriction on access to education, the violence and the brutality that is upholding this occupation.  That is the root cause - occupation and annexation - and that is what we must tackle.  As I have said, when one looks at Israeli Government policies, they appear to be deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in large parts of the occupied territories.<\/p><p>I also want to take as step forward because we are, one hopes, going to have a ceasefire.  The rockets will stop firing, the bombs will stop dropping and then what do we do?  In 2014 the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, GRM, was set up to help to rebuild Gaza.  The name GRM is Orwellian.  The Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism essentially stops the reconstruction of Gaza and prevents humanitarian aid coming in.  All it did was increase the stranglehold of occupation and control over the Gaza Strip.  We are now in a position at the UN Security Council to be engaging in that next round.  The GRM was a tripartite agreement between Israel, Palestine and the UN.  We must ensure that if there is another GRM, it should work this time.  Ultimately, we should be ending the occupation because that is the only way we are going to reconstruct Gaza but in the meantime, before that, we must ensure the GRM works.  We must support the International Criminal Court, ICC, to ensure any war crimes committed now actually end up there and do not happen with impunity.  We must ensure that if there is going to be another Goldstone report, it should be funded and supported properly.  All these things are essential but in the long term, the only thing we can really do to end this is to recognise the annexation, call it out and work to end the occupation.  All of the things other Deputies have spoken about, including recognition, the occupied territories Bill and recognition of de facto annexation are the things we should be doing to achieve that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000037#NN00300","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1621518000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The death toll in the region has surpassed 200 as we look on in horror at the terrible violence unfolding in the Middle East.

The killing of innocent civilians and children by Israelis is truly appalling and Israeli air strikes in the heart of Gaza killed at least 26 people and destroyed three buildings at the weekend in one of the deadliest attacks since fighting broke out.  Ten women and eight children were among those killed in Sunday's attack, with another 50 injured.  An Israeli air strike destroyed the offices of the Associated Press and other media outlets.  This was an attack on the press itself and the proverbial two fingers to a free press that seeks to expose the horrors unfolding in the region.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has given us the latest death tallies for the Palestinian people.

The current violence is not taking place in a vacuum and it is the product of 54 years of Israeli colonisation of Palestinian lands.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1967, 250 illegal Israeli settlements have been erected, with well over 650,000 illegal settlers.  This is based on an Israeli strategy of remove, fragment and replace, which is designed to allow Israeli settlers to maximise the amount of Palestinian land for themselves.  This is apartheid in practice.  In 2020, 848 Palestinian homes were destroyed, affecting 6,380 Palestinians, including 534 children.  Up to 30 April this year, 316 buildings were destroyed, representing an increase of 108% on the rate for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The human cost of this is catastrophic.  Thousands have been left homeless and very often following the destruction of schools, young children are forced to travel 15 miles to other schools, during which they will often have to pass settlements where they can be subject to abuse.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in call for the implementation of UN resolutions and the enforcement of international law.  We call on the Government to exert its power, influence and moral authority to help bring an end to annexation and use its position on the UN Security Council to full effect to create the moral impetus required for the international community to act.  We also call on the Government to formally recognise the state of Palestine on the basis of the 1967 borders, with east Jerusalem as its capital, and give its support to the occupied territories legislation.  We further call on the Government to expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland for crimes against the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000038#OO00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1621518000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Ten days of terror have been raining down on the people of Gaza.

It was support for the Israeli regime and its actions.  It took nine days of this horror for US President Biden to even call for a ceasefire, and when he did so, he made sure to reiterate what he described as his &quot;firm support&quot; for Israel's right to defend itself.  How do we translate Israel's &quot;right to defend itself&quot; in this discourse?  This equates to the right to continue to murder Palestinians.<\/p><p>Of course, Israel should immediately cease fire but the truth is there will be no long-lasting peace unless there is justice and an end to the occupation of Palestine.  It will not happen unless there is a kicking out of the forces of imperialism and capitalism, which have brought nothing but division, racism and exploitation to the Middle East.  On the basis of ordinary working-class people being in power, this could ensure a just solution, including the rights to a homeland of the Palestinian people as well as the Israeli Jewish people.<\/p><p>Something positive in the horror that has unfolded, which has given a glimpse of how a force exists to bring about that sort of just solution, is what we have seen with Palestinians, no matter where they are located, rising up together.  It is happening in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, within the borders of Israel, in Gaza and in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  We saw the impact of the general strike of Palestinians yesterday shutting down construction in large parts of Israel.  With this we get a glimpse of the potential power and the outlines of a new third <i>intifada<\/i>, which if based on the methods of the first intifada of mass struggle and democratic control from below holds the key to ending the occupation.<\/p><p>Within the horror of widespread racism in Israeli Jewish society there are small but significant indications of rejection.

The response of Israel to peaceful protests across the West Bank and in East Jerusalem has been confrontational.  It is unacceptable.  The air strikes by Israel on Gaza are brutal and disproportionate.  Many innocent civilians, including children, have been killed.  The air strikes by Israeli defence forces on Gaza and the rocket attacks by Hamas from Gaza on Israel have to stop.  There is an urgent need for a ceasefire.  The international community must intervene.  Ireland must continue its efforts to restore peace in the short term and bring about a long-term political settlement in the region through the UN Security Council, the EU Foreign Affairs Council and the Council of the European Union.  So far, the United Nations Security Council has failed in this regard and we know the reasons for that.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, there is a long history to these hostilities.  Israel began to implement its plan to occupy and resettle Palestinian territory decades ago, which resulted in oppression and injustice being visited on the Palestinian people ever since.  This activity is relentless, and especially now in the West bank and East Jerusalem.  It involves home demolitions and forced displacement and transfers.  The appropriation of Palestinian homes, lands and properties continues.  This expansion of Israeli settlements and the creeping process of annexation has to stop.  These actions are fundamentally breaching Palestinians' human rights and are, in so many ways, a breach of international humanitarian law.  Palestinians are being denied equal rights and are being discriminated against in areas effectively under Israeli control.  By any objective standard, this can be called apartheid and should be treated as such by the international community.  A long-term political solution is needed to resolve this ongoing cycle of violence.  Strong commitments are given in the programme for Government on this issue, which refers to the need for a two-state solution, to recognising the state of Palestine, opposing the annexation of territory in the West Bank and opposing the maintenance and expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.  All of this has to happen.  Israel must be persuaded to the existence of a Palestinian state.<\/p>  <p>  The occupied territories Bill did not make the programme for Government, and there are political reasons for that.  In any event, the Attorney General has stated that it is incompatible with EU law.  Next month, however, the European Commission will publish a legislative proposal on mandatory EU-wide human rights and environmental due diligence.  I believe this is very relevant to the situation in the occupied territories in the Middle East.  I hope that this proposal can be agreed and implemented as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that this debate is taking place in Government time but the D&aacute;il must pass an all-party motion dealing with these issues.  The all-party motion would call on the Government to take all measures within its power to make sure Israel is held accountable for its annexation of Palestinian territory, that it halts all settlement activity and that it ensures equal rights and an end to discrimination to all people who are, effectively, under its control.  This would send out a powerful message and I hope we can all agree on this.

Gaza is 41 km long and 10 km wide, with 2 million people locked into it.  Can one imagine if 2 million people were locked into that block of land in Ireland?  The blockade by Israel goes back to 2007.  It is in breach and in contravention of international humanitarian law.  In ten days of the recent bombardment of Gaza, 184 residential towers, 34 media centres, and 1,335 housing units have been destroyed, some 13,000 housing units were partially damaged, 230 people are dead, 65 of whom are children, and more than 1,700 people are wounded.  Innocent bystanders such as a man who was disabled, his pregnant wife and their three-year-old daughter all died in recent bombings in Gaza.  Currently, more than 80% of the 2 million people in Gaza are dependent on international humanitarian aid.<\/p>  <p>  I visited Gaza in 2009 after the bombardment by Israel between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009.  In that bombardment, 1,440 people were killed, of whom more than 330 were children.  Is the same target now being set by the Israeli Government in the current bombardment?  We do not have answers to the question of when this atrocity is going to stop.  When will the continuous bombing of the area stop?  Cluster munitions were used in the 2008 and 2009 bombardment, which are what we would call \"nail bombs\" in Northern Ireland.  White phosphorus was also used, which burns not only the skin but also right into the bone.  No-one is held accountable.  That was in 2009.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting how the US has now vetoed the UN Security Council.  We see too the latest arms deal of more than &euro;700 million.  It is interesting that a motion is now going before the US Congress looking for that to be stalled.  More than $3.8 billion is given by the US to Israel every year.  This is where we should apply the pressure, for the US to stop giving the support so that we can stop the atrocities that are currently occurring in this region.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Gaza 12 years ago.  Are we going to have the same debate in another 12 years, with no change?  Will it be 20 years when we have the same debate with no change?

The UN said this could amount to war crimes.  I say this is a war crime.  The international community and the Irish Government have a duty to step in to help end this crisis and defend the rights of the Palestinian people.  How can the Government do this?  It can start by recognising the state of Palestine.  This would send a really strong message of solidarity and is the correct path to move forward.  Successive Governments have continually dragged their heels on recognising the Palestinian state.  The continued and worn out mantra that the time is not right is just an insult.

I welcome the additional humanitarian aid the Minister announced this afternoon and the extra &euro;1 million for UNRWA and the additional &euro;500,000 for UNICEF on top of what had already been pledged.<\/p>  <p>  I have spent long enough in the Middle East, and that region in particular, to know there are no angels on either side from a combatant point of view.  It is clear from the casualty roll that the Israeli defence forces are operating in an indiscriminate, disproportionate and unacceptable manner.  While all nations are entitled to self-defence this strays way beyond self-defence, particularly so because the iron dome missile interceptor system gives the Israeli defence forces a distinct and decisive advantage.  A central tenet and principle of international humanitarian law is that the side with the greatest power bears the greatest responsibility when it comes to civilian casualties.  There is a lot of extra work the Israeli defence forces needs to do from this point of view.<\/p>  <p>  Uttering these things in an Irish Parliament outside of Israel does not make anybody anti-Semitic.  If anything, this Parliament is pro-Semitic.  It is pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian, pro-Palestine and pro-peace.  We are good friends with the people in the Middle East.  Good friends should be able to speak frankly and honestly with each other and tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear.  I echo the call of the Minister for a ceasefire and guaranteed humanitarian access to Gaza.  I urge the Minister to continue his diplomatic shuttle diplomacy between various capitals to try to seek a resolution.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise getting a ceasefire will not be easy and that diplomacy is not easy either.  As Victor Hugo once said, not being heard is no reason for silence, so keep up the work from this perspective.  Getting a ceasefire from midnight tonight or midnight tomorrow night will not be easy.  Perhaps we should consider a more interim phased approach before we get to a complete truce to allow the opportunity for a political process to kick in.  Perhaps the Minister might wish to consider getting one side in particular, and we all know what side that is, to make a unilateral declaration of proportionality at least, and make a unilateral declaration that it will look after civilians to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  To the Israeli Embassy, which I have no doubt is listening to this exchange and debate, I ask that it convey the sentiment of the Irish Parliament, which is at least a consensus sentiment and perhaps a unanimous sentiment, back to the Prime Minister.

In the past 11 days, we have seen untold suffering being inflicted, predominantly on the people of the Gaza Strip.  We need to recognise the violence that breaks out in the Middle East seems to follow a standard pattern.  Sometimes rockets are fired by Hamas into Israel and inevitably we get a response from the Israeli military and Government that is always disproportionate, excessive and indiscriminate.  We see this by looking at the numbers of casualties in the region over the past 11 days.  To date, it appears 230 Palestinians have been killed in this violence.  Of them, 65 are children.  We also note that ten Israelis have died.  None of these lives should have been lost.  None of these people should have died.  The comparison between the number of Palestinians killed and the number of Israelis killed indicates the indiscriminate and excessive level of violence being perpetrated on the Palestinians by the Israeli Government.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, none of these deaths should have occurred and they could have been avoided if there was recognition that what is required in the Middle East is a political resolution.  We have seen in our own country the pointlessness of violence for the purpose of trying to achieve one's political gains.  It simply does not work.  We have also seen in our country the benefit of negotiation and political leadership to resolve political disputes that appear intractable.  Unfortunately, when it comes to political resolution a huge obligation rests on the more powerful party.  In this instance, the more powerful party is Israel.  Regrettably, we have not seen brave political leadership in Israel since the days of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres back in 1994.  We should recall that peace can be achieved in the Middle East because these two men, along with Yasser Arafat, won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on the Oslo Accords in 1994.<\/p>  <p>  What has happened in Israel, and perhaps in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, is that hardliners have assumed too much power.<\/p> <p>We need to recognise that this violence will continue excessively until such time as there is a political resolution.<\/p> <p> It is extraordinary that there is such unanimity coming from this Chamber.

We have a strong voice.  We are on the Security Council.  We need to use our voice to ensure the United Nations and, more specifically, the United States respond more appropriately to the ongoing inappropriate use of violence by Israel.

I listened careful to what my colleague, Deputy Haughey, said in respect of that.  We should use that opportunity next week in terms of what the European Commission is doing to ensure there is a unified response from the European Union to the ongoing actions in the Middle East.<\/p> <p> We also need to recognise that what is going on is, in effect, the plantation of settlements for the purpose of the annexation of Palestine.

Of Ireland, he said that &quot;though it is a tiny nation, it is a ... moral giant in today's world of fake news, doublespeak and injustice&quot; and he begged us to use that voice to speak out and to rethink our policy on Palestinian-Israeli conflict by upgrading at the very least the status of our office in Ramallah to an embassy.  I say that in the context of the programme for Government which commits to recognising the state of Palestine in due course when it furthers peace but, significantly, before that, to protect the integrity of Palestinian territory.  If this is not a time to stand up and protect the integrity of Palestine, I do not know when that time will come.<\/p><p>The Minister has given figures today.  They are actually out of date.

He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tMr. President,<br \/><br \/>There are no words that can describe the horrors our people are enduring. ...<br \/><br \/>When you embrace your children and grandchildren tonight, think of our children and of how you can honour those killed and [that important little part of the sentence] spare those still alive.  ... each time Israel hears a foreign leader speak of its right to defend itself, it is further emboldened to continue murdering entire families in their sleep.<br \/><br \/>Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, one family at a time.  Israel is trying to uproot Palestinians from Jerusalem, expelling families, one home, one neighbourhood at a time.  Israel is persecuting our people, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.  [It] is unapologetic ...  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am absolutely supportive of Palestine.  I am absolutely supportive of Israel in its right to live peacefully as well.I absolutely condemn the violence of Hamas, but the violence by Israel is out of all proportion.

The power of social media is bringing us their stories and the stark realities of their lives.<\/p> <p> I unequivocally condemn the state of Israel&rsquo;s apartheid aggression and the US and EU that turn their eyes away from this genocide.  The inappropriate responses from President Biden and President von der Leyen and others about both sides and the comments that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas rockets while completely ignoring the rising number of children&rsquo;s deaths is the worst of international politics.  It is not anti-Semitic to speak out against the murder of innocent children, to boycott goods from occupied territories or to call out genocide.  <\/p> <p> Once again, the Tortoise Shack podcast has brought us harrowing on-the-ground news.  A recent recording included a short podcast with Gaza-based journalist Hana Salah when loud explosions could be heard very close to her location.  The short episode ended with her saying that she had to leave the building and get to safety.<\/p> <p> The Twitter feed of the Israel defence forces is just bizarre.  They are tweeting in English and have 1.4 million followers.  The Twitter feed of the state of Israel has been tweeting rocket emojis.  That is the state of its defence.  A thread of tweets was full of rocket emojis.<\/p> <p> On 9 December last, I moved the motion that restored Senator Frances Black&rsquo;s Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill to the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il for this term after others had refused to do so.  It is time to urgently progress this Bill, which is constitutional despite the advice of the Attorney General.  The Government should move it forward right away.<\/p> <p> Ireland should also expel the Israeli ambassador.  The Ceann Comhairle will remember when we expelled a Russian diplomat in a show of solidarity with the UK in 2018.  The Ceann Comhairle should immediately disband the Ireland-Israel parliamentary friendship committee.  It is something we as Members of this House can do right away.  It is completely fair for Members of the House to say that we do not extend friendship to those who kill innocent children and civilians.  Let us show Palestine that Ireland stands in full solidarity by doing the things we can do now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000041#RR00600","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621520400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I want to add my voice to the unanimity of the House in pleading with the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to act.  We had great respect all over the world as a neutral and peaceful country.  We now seem to be beholden to greater powers in Europe and the United States.  We need to send an unequivocal message to the world, and especially Israel, that we will not stand idly by, to use a 1969 phrase from a former Taoiseach.  It is probably the wrong phrase to use.  I refer to the genocide, the murder and slaughter of innocent children and the demolition of houses.  We have talked about homes in Ireland and how hard it is to create a home.  Homes are being knocked down by rockets and bombardments in front of our eyes.  Families are being wiped out.<\/p>  <p>  There is a genocide and a plantation going on in Gaza.  It is happening incrementally.  We have the numbers.  We have seen the might of Israel.  I do not condone Hamas throwing rockets into Israel.  It is being provocative.  Quite simply, it is like a lion against a mouse.  The response is shattering.  Israel can flex its muscles.  The arms industry and the amount invested in armaments are frightening.  It was interesting to listen to Deputy Berry's contribution because he knows the area from his Army experience.<\/p>  <p>  We have to send a message out.  I support Deputy Pringle's call to put forward Senator Black's Bill.  We regularly hear excuses involving the Attorney General.  I have no disrespect for him, but it is one view of a legal situation.  Deputy O'Callaghan made a contribution to this debate.  One could get another view from another senior counsel as to legality.  We need to be independent and to have the best and fairest examination possible of Senator Black's Bill.  We need to do something.  Standing idly by is not an option for the Government and the Irish people. <\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Government to challenge the President of the European Commission to do more and push for more.  We want a ceasefire and we want peace.  That is not easily achieved.  We could look at our own situation in the North and what we got in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  It was a remarkable feat involving a number of former taoisigh, Fr. Alec Reid, Dr. Martin Mansergh and many others.  Where there is a will there is a way.<\/p>  <p>  The tweets being sent by Israel are teasing the rest of the world.  We have to send a clear message that we do not support or condone it.  I agree that we must re-examine the Ireland-Israel friendship group.  We have no truck for it at the moment.  That would be a first step.  It would be a p&iacute;osa beag.  It would tell Israel that we do not appreciate its actions.  It might not respect us, but a lot of countries around the world had, and continue to have, great respect for us and our diaspora.<\/p>  <p>  We need to act, and we must act now to stop the slaughter.  Imagine what it would be like going home tonight to my family, including eight grandchildren, and having three generations wiped out by one rocket launch or bomb.  It is so horrific that one cannot conjure up such images and words are not strong enough to condemn it.  On behalf of the six Rural Independent Group Deputies, I call on the Government to act in a forthright and very firm manner, condemn this for what it is and call it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000042#SS00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1621520400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their statements on this issue.  I would like to restate the Government&rsquo;s deep concern at the intensification of violence in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel over the past week.  We are all in agreement that now is the time for de-escalation and we must encourage all efforts to reach a ceasefire.  We cannot ignore the fact that these events are terrifying for Palestinian and Israeli civilians.  The number of child casualties, over a quarter of all fatalities, is particularly shocking.  The protection of all civilians is of paramount importance and, indeed, it is an obligation under international humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  Israel has a right to defend itself.  The deaths of Israeli citizens are unacceptable and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has rightly called on all factions in Gaza to halt indiscriminate attacks on Israel immediately.  However, the impact of Israeli strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip is disproportionate, a fact to which many Deputies alluded.  The impact on children in an already difficult humanitarian situation is especially worrying.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to address some of the points raised regarding these civilian impacts.  As Minister of State at the Department of Education, it is especially shocking to read reports of damage and destruction to schools and educational facilities.  The UN reports that 45 schools, two kindergartens and a vocational training centre have been damaged in the Gaza Strip since the start of the escalation.  Education, as we know, is a lifeline for the 2 million people of Gaza.  It is an opportunity to escape the daily realities of the blockade which has left them forcibly isolated from the rest of the world for over 13 years.<\/p>  <p>  The repeated cycles of violence and bloodshed, as well as living in fear of the next air strike, have a strong effect on the emotional and psychosocial well-being of students, teachers, and their communities.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;500,000 for UNICEF&rsquo;s emergency appeal, which will include emergency psychosocial services for 5,000 children suffering trauma as a result of the hostilities.<\/p>  <p>  The damage to hospitals and the knock-on impact on the provision of healthcare in the Gaza Strip is deeply worrying.  Six hospitals and 11 primary healthcare centres have been damaged, with one centre suffering severe damage.  In addition, damage to vital infrastructure and insufficient fuel supplies have affected water, sanitation and hygiene services for hundreds of thousands of people.  Electrical power shortages hinder healthcare provision throughout Gaza and one hospital is not functioning due to the lack of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  The latest hostilities have displaced over 58,000 Palestinians, many of whom are seeking refuge in UNRWA schools across Gaza.  There is, of course, the added concern at this time around the transmission of Covid-19 between vulnerable people huddled in crowded shelters and the inability of the healthcare system to cope.<\/p> <p>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs referenced in his statement, this is why we have announced funding of &euro;1.5 million to enable UN agencies carry out vital work in support of these vulnerable civilians.  <\/p> <p> While the focus today is rightly on the intensification of violence, we cannot, and must not, shy away from the fact that the overall human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories remains a matter of serious concern.  The protection and promotion of human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels.  <\/p> <p> Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard.  Ireland is a consistent and strong contributor in interactive dialogues with the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories at the council and, indeed, at the UN General Assembly.  At the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in March, Ireland made a statement under No. 7 during the general debate, which restated our commitment to principles of accountability and emphasised that Ireland will continue to speak out against unilateral actions that are in breach of international humanitarian law.  We regularly convey our concerns on human rights issues to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs raised these concerns with the Israeli ambassador last week.  We also provide financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs working on human rights issues.<\/p> <p> The events of the past week have not happened in isolation.  They come after settlement expansion, threats of evictions and violence against Palestinians.  Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution based on international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies raised a few issues, one of which was the occupied territories Bill.  As previously stated, the Bill would not be compatible with EU law and would not be implementable.  The Government will not, therefore, take it forward.  We acknowledge that support for the Bill is a sign of very deep concern about settlements.  Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements and will continue to so.  The Government's position on settlements is that we are absolutely opposed to them.  <\/p> <p> With respect to calls to expel the Israeli ambassador, Ireland's bilateral relationship with Israel is important as it is a means for us to directly communicate our concerns about actions such as those we witnessed in the past week.  On 11 May, the Minister called in the Israeli ambassador and underlined that Israel's actions in Gaza, which are causing significant civilian casualties, are unacceptable and Israel must act responsibly and comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.  These messages matter.  By expelling an ambassador, we would close down our channel of communication with the Israeli Government.  <\/p> <p> Furthermore, some Deputies asked whether Ireland will recognise Palestine.  As some Deputies pointed out, the programme for Government states that the Government will honour its commitment to recognise the state of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or, in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-state solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory.  The Minister has been clear that, in the absence of progress towards a two-state solution, he would be prepared to recommend to Government early recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful.  It is a matter that is also being discussed with EU colleagues.  Recognition by Ireland, outside the context of an overall peace agreement would, however, be likely to affect Ireland's influence on the Israel-Palestine conflict at EU and international level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000042#SS00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nursing Home Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1621521000,"counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621521000,"counter":418,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy was in possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I was in possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It has been some time coming.  Many people are interested in the issue and would have liked to see the Bill being brought forward sooner.  Its provisions will be important for those affected, particularly small family farmers and small business owners.  It will provide them with some solace and protection and will also ensure, in some part, that their businesses and farms are sustainable and viable.  That is a really important point for our rural communities, in particular, and is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  It also speaks to the greater point about models of care and the nursing homes support scheme.  There are very significant challenges.  Those of us interested in the demographics and the nature of our health services know that we have a very particular challenge in Ireland in sustaining nursing home support and care of the elderly.  We all want to see a model that provides for people living at home for as long as possible.  That is an important element.  Nursing homes have an important role to play, but much needs to be done to ensure that older people can live at home for as long as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the role of carers and the need to support them to care for people in their homes, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, brought forward a charter for carers.  A number of important measures would be of significant benefit in terms of practical supports for carers, such as talk therapy and expanding GP visit cards, in addition to increasing and expanding carer's allowance, carer's benefit and support grants.  The introduction of a discretionary grant for carers would be another important measure that would be a significant positive.  I know many who are struggling to pay their heating and electricity bills, such is the nature of their work and, unfortunately, the way in which they are valued by this State.  It is well recognised that carers play a major role in providing care, which is not valued in the way it should be.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The greater point about the role of the nursing homes scheme is that it has developed in a largely uncontrolled way.  I see it in my county of Meath, where there was much speculation, general tax breaks and incentives for people to build nursing homes.  People have ended up in that sector for reasons other than having a traditional background in healthcare provision and delivery.  That, in and of itself, raises the real need for a strong role for HIQA, but also for ensuring maintenance of high standards, which includes the terms and conditions of employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, certainly in its first wave, many of the weaknesses within the system.<\/p> <p>We will have an opportunity to address that.  Many people working in the sector are dedicated and tremendously hard-working.  It would be to everybody's benefit to put in place robust standards and protections for staff, workers and the residents themselves.  That will be important going forward as the growing ageing population puts pressure on those services.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and there will be further opportunities to develop it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00700","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621521600,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy O'Rourke.  We are glad to see this legislation.  The nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme, needs significant tweaking.  More widely, we need not only to support people in nursing homes but ensure we are not impacting on the sustainability of small businesses and small family farms.  That is something that has to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic period has made us look at how we deal with elder care.  There have been a number of reports in the last while, including those from the expert panel and HIQA, which stated that nursing homes should not be the only option for older people in need of enhanced care.  We are going to need an entire package.  We all know that home care packages can be lacking and that has been mentioned in this House from time to time.  Multidisciplinary supports are required to facilitate people in later life.  Our demographics are going to change and we will have a greater number of older people.  They should be able to stay living within their own homes, which is possibly better for them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Both HIQA and the expert panel agreed that we need reform of nursing home care.  We need to look at the way we do it, how we audit systems and the way we situate, organise and construct buildings.  We have to look at public versus private provision.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, some of our system was not necessarily designed but was the result of unintended consequences from tax breaks.  Money went in a particular direction and we ended up in the situation we are now in.  A number of nursing homes operated as separate businesses and outside the wider controls of the State or did not have the relationship with the HSE and the healthcare system that we would have wanted.  That led to difficulties, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic.  That is why a major part of the report of the Covid committee was on the requirement for an inquiry into how we dealt with that period.  There needs to be significant emphasis within this House on ensuring draft terms of reference are provided because they are required and we are behind time.  That was meant to have been done already.  There have been discussions and Government sources have said in the papers that we are moving towards an overall inquiry into elder care, and particularly into how it was dealt with at the beginning of this pandemic.  That is absolutely required.  We also need a committee to look at the guidance that has been given to us by these reports on how to deal holistically with elder care and produce a system that will deliver for all of us, especially our older people.<\/p>  <p>  We all remember the significant tragedies that occurred in nursing homes a year ago and we had a repeat of that in January.  A number of families who have gone through deep trauma and hurt are looking for answers.  They will require these inquiries.  I have spoken previously to both the Minister for Health and the Minister of State about the terrible tragedy that occurred in Dealgan House, with the loss of 22 residents.  That had a significant impact on their families and I commend them for the considerable work they have done in looking for answers.  The Minister and Minister of State have met with them and there have been discussions about creating a mechanism to provide them with answers.  As much as there needs to be a wider inquiry into the nursing home sector, how we dealt with the pandemic and how we deal with elder care in to the future, we also need a specific public inquiry into what went wrong in Dealgan House and what the lessons are for the future.  Everyone needs that.  The families are also experiencing difficulties in accessing information from the HSE.  I understand that we are in a difficult period due to the recent ransomware attack but this is something I will continue to bring up.  I will have conversations with the Minister and the Minister of State about this matter because we have to provide for these families.  Beyond that, we need to deliver a fit-for-purpose system and scheme for our elderly across the board.  I commend this legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000044#UU00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>This Bill has merit as regards the fair deal scheme and family farms and businesses.  I am sure there is great regret in homes across the State that funds that went out cannot be recouped.  The care of their elderly is preoccupying many families at the moment and it never stops, because true as night follows day, we are all getting older.  There is just no way out of that.<\/p>  <p>  While the fair deal aspect of the Bill has merit, I regret that it takes no proper account of the ongoing privatisation and commodification of the nursing home sector, where personal and State money is increasingly going to global wealth funds.  We should be asking questions about this in our Parliament, here in the D&aacute;il, and in public, because it is degrading and diminishing for our older people that their needs as they age are the subject of international profit and speculation.  We learned last week that French healthcare giant Orpea is to become the biggest provider in the nursing home market.  Orpea was reported as having a half-year revenue to June 2019 of &euro;1.9 billion.  That is almost &euro;2 billion revenue in six months alone.  This is serious business news with equally serious social consequences.  We are talking about wealth fund billions for the essential care of our own people, who worked hard, raised their families, bought their homes and paid their taxes all their lives.  I do not see anything in this Bill at this stage addressing how the care of our older people is being increasingly profitised and commodified.  That is everyone&rsquo;s business because if we are lucky, we will all live to be old and the care being speculated on as a market commodity will be our own.<\/p>  <p>  I know I speak for vast numbers of my constituents when I say we would like to age under our own steam and in our own communities wherever possible.  That is why in government, Sinn F&eacute;in will establish a statutory home care scheme, in order that our care is based around our needs, as opposed to our experience of ageing being made to fit the preferred care model.  A model that favours private profit over public service is just not acceptable.  I am not referring to the small, family-run private nursing homes.  I am referring to the huge investors and wealth funds.  We have been talking about these funds coming into our housing market but they are taking over our nursing homes as well.  We have to see elder care as a necessity and a right.  We would rather have supports for community living than the elevation of the nursing home model, and the private nursing home model at that.  However, it is inevitable that some of us will require nursing home care and we favour the public model in that necessary instance.  It can come as quite a shock to people to find out that only 20% of our nursing homes are in public ownership.  Just as with housing and childcare, elder care should never be commodified, because these are not options or luxuries.  These are essentials of living in which we, as citizens of this State, should not be placed at the mercy of profit and the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000044#UU00300","speaker":"1585"}]
