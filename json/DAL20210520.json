It is important to clarify that there is no legal definition of a feedlot herd.  The Department defines certain herds as controlled finishing units, CFUs, in the context of the bovine TB eradication programme.  This definition is unique to that programme and does not necessarily mirror the use of the term \"feedlot\" by the public and-or other institutions.  CFUs are subject to enhanced biosecurity measures as part of the TB programme and can only sell direct to slaughter.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to approve slaughter plants in accordance with the European Union (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations 2020 and after that to ensure that its approved plants operate in compliance with the EU's food hygiene legislation and animal health and welfare standards.  The Department's remit in regard to finishing units is to ensure that they operate in compliance with the EU's animal health and welfare standards.  The Department cannot, in carrying out this process, take into account issues such as the concentration of ownership of inputs to processing as it is outside the scope of this remit.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged the importance of transparency in the market for primary producers.  The Department is progressing several initiatives under my ministerial stewardship to increase transparency.  Central to my commitment to transparency is the establishment of a new office, to be called the office of the national food ombudsman or something similar.  The additional powers to be assigned to the new office by primary legislation, going beyond those in the unfair trading practices directive, are currently the subject of public consultation, which is open until 26 May.  This new office will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department and Bord Bia currently publish data in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the new office will be central in achieving transparency and ultimately ensuring that farmers are getting the best price possible in the market and that their income is maximised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000003#A00600","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1621497600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The only way we can ensure a food ombudsman or any other body will be able to tackle unfair practices within the sector is if we have all the information in the first instance.

We are basing all our information on the controlled finishing units, which serve as a proxy.  Even so, we know that 300,000 cattle, or over 15% of the total kill, came from within those units last year.  It is inconceivable to suggest they do not have an impact on the prices farmers receive.

If the public health authorities decided to review the experience of outbreaks in the sector, as suggested by the Deputy, the Department would certainly participate in such a review.  It is important to note that the public health advice for meat-processing plants has evolved since the start of the pandemic as the understanding of the risk factors has increased.<\/p> <p>Meat plants, particularly boning halls, can be noisy and humid workplaces and for food safety reasons the temperature is kept low through the recirculation of chilled air.  The experience internationally has been that because of these factors, the Covid-19 virus can be transmitted relatively easily between workers in meat plants.  To address these risk factors, detailed sector-specific public health guidelines were issued to meat processing plants early last summer, and implementation of these continues to be monitored.<br\/><br\/>As of 14 May 2021, the Department had completed 895 inspections, including unannounced inspections, on behalf of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine-approved food premises.  These inspections are ongoing and are in addition to the inspections carried out by the Health and Safety Authority itself, and in addition to the 49 premises where the Department has a permanent presence.  The Department has also supported the HSE as required in the context of local outbreak teams. <br\/><br\/>The Department continues to participate on a standing committee established last August to,<i>inter alia<\/i>, oversee a programme of polymerase chain reaction, PCR, serial testing of workers at larger meat plants and each cycle of PCR testing consists of four week cycles of testing.  The first cycle started on 14 September 2020 and a further eight cycles have been completed to date.  More than 180,000 tests have been carried out from cycles one to eight, with a positivity rate of 0.77% overall.The ninth cycle of serial testing is currently under way.<br\/><br\/><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><br\/><br\/>The Department has led and encouraged the roll-out of rapid antigen detection testing, RADT, at meat processing plants, as a risk mitigation measure.

SIPTU estimates that one in four meat workers got Covid-19 and that in turn seeded thousands of cases in the community.  That was evidenced by the high level of community transmission in counties and regions where there were numerous meat plants, counties such as Monaghan, Laois and Kildare, where we saw a spike in the level of what they called community transmission, but one has to ask how did the virus get into the community at that high level?<\/p>  <p>  The workers are not to blame.

Driving the development of the Irish organic sector is a major priority for me and my Department.  We have set the highest level of ambition ever for the sector in the programme for Government with an aim to reach the EU average of land farmed organically during the lifetime of this Government.  We are also committed to the full implementation of the current Review of Organic Food Sector and Strategy for its Development 2019-2025.  A key element in reaching this ambitious target is increasing the number of farmers farming organically.  To achieve this, I secured additional funding for this year to reopen the organic farming scheme.  I was delighted that 317 farmers have applied to convert to organic farming and perhaps, unlike the Deputy, I considered this quite a strong response given the many alternative scheme options that were available to farmers during this Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, transitional period.  If all these applicants are eligible and proceed to convert to organic farming, it will mean an increase of more than 20% in the number of farmers farming this way.  Of course, we are still waiting to find out what area of land these applications represent and we should know that shortly as the basic payment scheme, BPS, application window has just closed.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current budget allocated to the scheme this year will allow eligible applications successful entry into the scheme.  It is my intention to build on the interest shown to date and to drive further growth in organic farming.  I will be actively examining a further reopening of the scheme for next year subject to funding.  My Department is currently devising a new and ambitious organic farming scheme to be introduced under the new CAP in 2023 which will aim to increase the synergies that exist between organics, agri-environment climate measures and the eco-schemes and thus make organic farming a more attractive farming option.<\/p><p>Ultimately the development of the sector will be driven not just our scheme but by a range of factors.  We need to work closely with Bord Bia and indeed Teagasc to deliver on those.  I will certainly be trying to leverage as much support from both Bord Bia and Teagasc in this regard.  We need to keep the ambition high for organic farming, it is a very significant growth area and I look forward to seeing it grow.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>In association with Teagasc, the Department runs the organic farming demonstration programme.  Under this programme, a nationwide series of national organic farming open days takes place on selected organic demonstration farms.  This provides farmers with an insight into organic farming and is an invaluable tool in showcasing organic farming at a practical level.  This programme, by the sharing of knowledge at a local level, will hugely contribute to the conversion to organic farming.  <\/p><p>As well as all this however we may need to think even more broadly.  Many of our European counterparts use public procurement strategies to support their organic producers.  I want to look at whether or not we might do something similar here.  In this regard, the programme for government does include commitments to green public procurement, and I believe there is room to see how organic food production might fit with that.<\/p><p>In summary, nobody has shown the level of ambition for the Irish organic sector as this Government.

In the course of these negotiations, the Presidency has offered a compromise solution of a minimum of 85% convergence which has been rejected by the Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  I have argued that we must have subsidiarity to make our own call at national level.  I have held tight to the Council's general approach of a minimum of 75% convergence and 20% for the eco scheme, particularly so that we are in a position to make our own national call on convergence.  If we can get discretion at European level, we will have a full engagement with all farmers across the country and with all stakeholders about what approach we take domestically with regard to convergence.  It is an important issue and is always contested.  There are winners and losers.  It is important that we get as much power to set our own destiny as possible so that we can engage with everybody's ideas and talk to all farmers, then make our own call later this year.  First, we will have to see what is the minimum level at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000007#E01800","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1621500000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>In January last year, when the Minister was in opposition, he argued that there was no reasonable basis to stop the convergence process during the transition period.

I am pleased to say the first meeting of the independent working group took place on 4 March and it has met regularly since.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through the Horticulture Industry Forum, engages with the horticulture sector on an ongoing basis.  As recently as 20 April, I co-chaired a Horticulture Industry Forum meeting where the challenges and opportunities facing the industry were discussed.  At a broader level, the Department provides support to the horticulture industry through the scheme of investment aid for the development of the horticulture sector.  Financial support is available to assist growers and businesses through grant aid for capital investments in specialised plant and equipment, including renewable energy, as well as technology adoption specific to commercial horticulture production.  A 50% budget increase to &euro;9 million has been secured for 2021, which reflects the importance of the sector and the importance we are placing on it.  The scheme is 100% funded by the Government.  In addition, the Department administers the EU producer organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables, which allows growers to jointly market their production in order to strengthen the position of producers in the marketplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000008#F01800","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1621500600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Like other Members, the Minister of State will have heard the valid concerns about livelihoods in the sector because it is being targeted.

They are not being supported and they feel they have been abandoned.  As a result, there are businesses in my constituency that are now sourcing horticultural peat from Scotland, Estonia and elsewhere.  For a sector that accounts for a minuscule amount of all the peat harvested here, how can the Minister of State say, given the emissions involved in continuously importing an inferior product from abroad, that this is the more environmentally friendly way of moving forward?  We know the suggested alternatives are produced in ways that fall below our environmental standards.

Therefore, the Deputy is correct that there is a necessity to have a just transition to facilitate growers to move away from this growing medium to another more sustainable source.

Therefore, the alternatives to the use of domestic horticultural peat are that we continue to import peat from outside the State, that we export our mushroom industry or that flexibility is shown to allow a sector like that to use domestic peat.  The volume needed for this use is a fraction of what was needed for energy production.

Funding provided to South Dublin County Council in support of the Clondalkin Equine Centre has been the largest capital commitment by the Department in support of an urban horse programme.<\/p> <p>To date the Department has provided funding of almost &euro;560,000, with a further &euro;26,000 made available this year subject to commitments entered into by officials from the Department and the club.  This agreement was in the context of limitations imposed by Covid-19, agreeing further efforts to secure alternative funding and the proposed formulation of a strategy for the organisation.  This funding of &euro;503,000 in 2016 was committed to on the understanding that South Dublin County Council satisfied itself with the rules and governance of the club and that the project, when up and running, would be self-sustaining and assisted with reducing reliance on control of horses' activities.<\/p> <p> This project also committed to the education of horse owners, particularly young horse owners, in the care and welfare of horses, as well as presenting educational and development opportunities for young people.  At the time, the Department made it clear to South Dublin County Council that funding would not be available for the day-to-day running of the club going forward.  To ensure sustainability, the Department worked with the council towards the hiring of a part-time project manager with responsibility for the further development of this horse project and the Department provided funding towards this employment for a time.<\/p> <p> The Department provided further funding in 2019 of &euro;20,000 to the council towards the salary of a full-time manager following a commitment from the club to pursuing alternative streams of revenue.  Earlier this year, following representations and meetings with the club board and management, the Department agreed to provide a final tranche of short-term funding to the project through the council.  The Government is committed to supporting urban horse projects and work is ongoing with other Departments and local authorities to ensure that horses and the young people who care for them receive appropriate support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000009#G01300","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621501800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and acknowledge the funding provided by his Department.

Some of the commentary, certainly not from Deputy Conway-Walsh but from some elements in recent weeks and months, suggesting it was inappropriate and that students should not be claiming the pandemic unemployment payment shows a huge lack of understanding of the impact this pandemic has had on young people and people of all ages.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Conway-Walsh is aware, the student support scheme was established in 2012.  It is a vital support for people accessing third level.  Almost 101,000 applications were received by SUSI for grant support in the 2020 to 2021 academic year with just over 79,000 applications being assessed as eligible for grant support.  The projected total cost for this year is &euro;370 million.  Applications for the 2021 to 2022 academic year are now open and to date we have received 46,000 applications.  I am pleased to say that 28,500 of these applications have now been assessed and 26,500 have been approved for support.  This is an early indication of the very high success rate of people applying and being deemed eligible.<\/p>  <p>  With regard specifically to the pandemic unemployment payment, this has been treated as reckonable income since it was introduced in March 2020.  This is not a new development.  Income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments, such as jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  It is very important there is a consistency of approach for all students.  We cannot decide one student getting one social welfare payment is more or less important or entitled than somebody else.  A student or family on jobseeker's benefit, for example, or on jobseeker's allowance or the one-parent family benefit, must be treated the same as a student for family on the pandemic unemployment payment.  However, I want to say we have a change of circumstance mechanism for students or families who had been receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, and who will not be in future as the economy reopens, to tell the SUSI system there has been a change of circumstance.

If these students were working as normal or under the employment wage subsidy scheme they would be entitled to deduct holiday earnings of &euro;4,500 when applying to SUSI.  At the very least, this deduction should be applied to the pandemic unemployment payment for students.  At a committee meeting, I highlighted to the Minister that I thought it was strange the demand for SUSI this year was in line with 2019 despite the State being in lockdown for much of the year and so many people being out of work.  This only adds up if many other students will be pushed out of qualifying for SUSI because of accepting the pandemic unemployment payment when they lost their employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000012#K00500","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1621503000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>So far, what we are seeing is a significant number of applicants being granted the SUSI grants.

As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said, it gives me an opportunity to expand further on the previous question.  There is a holiday earnings disregard under SUSI of &euro;4,500 in respect of income earned by students outside of term time, for example, the summer period and the Christmas season.  Importantly, this remains available to all SUSI applicants in respect of such earnings.  Students and others may decide to avail of work over the summer period and the income disregard remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  A core principle that underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there has to be a consistency of approach and equitable treatment of students and their families to ensure fair use of the financial resources available.<\/p> <p>This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.<\/p> <p> In being conscious of making sure that we continue to support our students and that we recognise we have lived through extraordinary times, I need to make sure that we are consistent and fair to all students regardless of which social welfare support they may have received over the past year.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is a social protection payment for employees and self-employed people who lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 due to Covid-19 public health emergencies.  Students who lost their employment due to Covid-19 are eligible for the payment.  I am pleased that that is the case.  The PUP payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020.  This is not new.  It has always been reckonable income.  This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection benefits.  We need to be fair.  We need to be equitable, including in how we apply the terms of the holiday income disregard.<\/p> <p> We have received over 46,000 applications.  We have assessed over 28,500.  The number of people who have been assessed as eligible for support is 26,500 - a very high rate.  We are keeping this under close review.<\/p> <p> Most students are assessed based on the family income - the income coming into the house.  Most families and most households in this country have seen their income go down and not up over the course of the pandemic.  I am not yet convinced that this will be a major factor but I will monitor it closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000012#K01100","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621503600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>It may not be a major factor in every case but for the individual cases in which it may be a factor, it could be life-changing.  This is the issue.  My understanding is that there is a &euro;4,500 income disregard applied to any income earned during the period for the SUSI grant applications and students are being advised that income from the PUP payment is not included in the income disregard.  I am asking the Minister that the PUP be automatically included in the income disregard for applicants of the SUSI grant scheme because, as the Minister has repeated, there does not appear to be a huge problem.  However, the Minister must concede that even if it is in one case, it will be life-changing for that individual student.  Given the circumstances that we have all lived through for the past year, it is not worth it for this anomaly to continue to stand over a system that should be more flexible considering the type of industries that students normally work in, such as the hospitality sector and retail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000013#L00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1621503600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>First, we should not say we are standing over a system that we are not yet sure is as the Deputy describes.

For example, if I was to include a PUP payment as an income disregard, why would the Deputy not wish me to include a lone parent's payment as an income disregard, a jobseeker's benefit which is the same principle, or a jobseeker's allowance?  I need to make sure that I do not do anything that is not legal in the first instance and I also need to make sure that I do not do anything that is not equitable.  My approach to this - I say this in a constructive fashion - is to see if the change-of-circumstances mechanism can be flexible and comprehensive and show enough commonsense to work through the individual cases.

I have met a number of students, either studying medicine as graduate entrants or considering doing that.  I am concerned because the argument they would put forward to me is that there is benefit both to the health service and to them as future doctors in having undertaken a degree, perhaps, in the first instance, that is not in medicine.  For example, I met a young man recently who decided to do a science degree and then go into medicine by that route but there is a much increased financial cost should he choose to go that way.  Let me share some of my thoughts on this.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the provision of graduates for the health service through undergraduate and postgraduate provision.  Progression is a key tenet of the SUSI scheme and section 2 of the Student Support Act 2011 defines \"progression\" as \"the process by which learners may transfer from one course to another course where the award that may be made on the successful completion of the second mentioned course is of a higher level.\"  That is the challenge we encounter at present, that somebody entering graduate-entry medicine is entering at the same level as perhaps another undergraduate degree that he or she did.  The student accessing graduate-entry medicine will, as a matter of course, hold a level 8 qualification prior to the entry and completion of a graduate-entry medicine degree confers a further level 8 qualification on that individual.  At present, that is where we are legislatively stuck.<\/p>  <p>  Students pursuing a second degree course are not eligible for free-fees funding or for student grants and, therefore, graduate-entry medicine students have not qualified for these programmes since the introduction of the courses.  However, to widen access to graduate-entry medicine programmes and to assist the students pursuing these programmes, the fees of EU students enrolled in graduate-entry medicine are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  As of the 2020 academic year, the State contribution is &euro;11,524 per graduate-entry student per year and the balance of fees is payable by students.<\/p>  <p>  I will come back on this in a moment to look at some of the mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000013#L00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1621503600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Every year gets more competitive for the Irish student to study medicine and, as the Minister stated, other students begin with another degree and then try to get back in and study medicine.

If it is possible to imagine, this is even more difficult to get into than directly from the leaving certificate.  Fees are approximately &euro;15,000 a year.  That is &euro;60,000 over four years.<\/p>  <p>  There are no Government supports to help students who do not come from wealthy families and the only option is the loan from the Bank of Ireland.  However, I have been contacted by a young man from Limerick who tried to get this bank loan and was told that he needed a guarantor to sign the loan and that the guarantor had to earn at least &euro;50,000 a year.  The young man in question comes from a single-parent household and his mother does not earn more than &euro;50,000 a year.

The second area is that at present they cannot apply for SUSI.  This is a big ask of theirs, as Deputy Conway-Walsh will be aware because she and I have been engaged on this.  There is a review of SUSI that is due to be concluded over the summer months and finally concluded in the autumn.  This is one area that can be looked at as part of that review.  The third area is just to point out to any student that the student assistance fund is available for a student even if he or she is accessing a degree on the same level as already funded.  That might provide some short-term assistance.  I should also point out tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of any fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The first of two other areas I want to examine is SUSI, in the context of the review, and whether there is something we can do there to help.  Second, we are already providing a degree of subsidised fees to the tune of over &euro;11,000 per student per year who goes into graduate entry medicine.  Can we do more in that regard?  They are the two practical areas that people in this House can reasonably ask me to examine.  I am very happy to do that.<\/p>  <p>  From my point of view, as the Minister with responsibility for higher education and skills in this country I can see a lot of merit in the idea that a young student leaving school might wish to do a degree that could benefit him or her later when studying medicine.  In a number of European and other countries across the world it is often the case that the doctor one sees at one's bedside is a fully qualified medical doctor but also has a background in another area.  For example, occupational therapists and scientists in this country have gone on to be doctors.  The pandemic has shown that there is benefit in broadening that base of diversity in learning.

I have undertaken to do two things between now and September, in conjunction with a number of Government colleagues, in particular the Ministers of State, Deputies Josepha Madigan and Anne Rabbitte.<\/p>  <p>  The first thing I want to do is to examine the transition planning for students with disabilities when they leave school.  I have been Minister for Health, as the Deputy knows.  The discussion is often too narrow and concerns what health services a person will be provided with post school, rather than what skills or jobs he or she would like or what college he or she would like to go to.  We are narrowing the conversation and sometimes almost suggesting that an educational journey must end when a person leaves school. <\/p>  <p>  I am doing a piece of work with the Department of Education, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and my Department regarding what I am calling transition planning, career guidance and the like.<\/p>  <p>The second piece we are doing is a mapping exercise.  There are some very good examples of good practice out there.  Next week, for example, I will visit the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities.  It is taking students with intellectual disabilities, and I have met them on a number of occasions already, straight from school and getting them into Trinity College, where they leave with an award and are linked in with employment.  I met the National Learning Network in my constituency, which is also running a number of programmes through the Rehab Group.  There are many examples of good practice which we are mapping out.  By September I intend to report back to the Cabinet committee and, indeed, will be delighted to report back to the House on what more we can do.<\/p> <p> We are developing a new national access plan.  It is due to be developed this year.  We have exceeded many targets in this area, but this is because the targets are under-ambitious.  We are not measuring enough types of disability in that national access plan.  We are out to consultation on it at the moment and will be developing the new national access plan during the course of the year.  We need transition planning, a mapping out of what is there and then a scaling up of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000014#M01400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621504800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>It is most important that there is development and a pathway for people throughout the regions.

It was launched in 2018 but, to date, out of the proposed eating disorder network of eight adult and eight child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams, only three teams have commenced recruitment and are delivering a service.  Two are CAMHS and one is for adults, which is only three out of 16 in three years.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is provided with funding on a yearly basis.  I am told funding is also available this year to progress the recruitment of clinicians, but the HSE has stated: \"The availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in Mental Health services where demand outstrips supply in both the national and international contexts\".  I am told only three adult beds are available, all of which are based in community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6.  Very limited services are available for anyone else affected outside that CHO area.<\/p>  <p> It is recognised that most people can, and do, recover from eating disorders and the most effective treatment is in the community.  The HSE-approved model of care for eating disorders sounds wonderful on paper, but it is based on establishing specialist regional teams with skilled clinicians that will collaborate with hospitals and GPs.

First, there will obviously be a lead-in time for training.  For example, for someone working in psychiatry we are talking about a study period of seven years.  Second, from my Department's point of view, we are ready, willing and standing by ready to help.

The Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 is of high importance to Ireland and the life of the language in this country.

Under the advanced Irish language strategic initiative, funded by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, there are eight courses available in five different institutions.  There were a total of 73 students enrolled in these courses in 2019-20.  Since 2015, 9,286 students have been enrolled in higher education courses on the Irish language or conducted through Irish.

If Northern Ireland was still in the European Union the question would need to be altered.  However, I do take very seriously the point the Deputy makes.

That review is being finalised and I expect to receive it in quarter 2 of this year.  I will be happy to brief the Deputy on that review and debate it in this House.  <\/p> <p> This analysis highlighted the high level of fee support, amounting to more than &euro;500 million annually, composed of funding for tuition of almost 140,000 eligible undergraduate students in higher education.

I worry sometimes when the message goes out about the student contribution fee that people considering accessing higher education may think that every student in the country must pay &euro;3,000.  Nearly half of our students now get their registration fees paid in full or in part under the SUSI grants scheme, and we are reviewing SUSI to ensure that more students are included.  <\/p> <p> The student registration fee, however, is very high and I would like to see it reduced.  It must, however, be done as part of a sustainable funding model.  What we will not be doing is introducing a student loan scheme, such as we have seen in other jurisdictions.

We have seen a withdrawal of the State from higher education.  The third-level institutions are being given 50% less funding per student than in 2008.  That is 72% less, if we account for inflation, and therefore very close to a reduction of three quarters in funding per student.  The facts speak for themselves.  The costs were pushed onto students and families, and fees were increased from &euro;850 in 2008 to &euro;3,000 today.  It is an issue of equality of access.  If we want an equal and fair education system, this barrier must be removed.  Education is a public good, and it must be treated and invested in as such.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great unfairness regarding the contribution fee for those leaving certificate students from last year who found out that their grades had been upgraded in the leaving certificate examinations they sat in November.  They got their results and were again charged that contribution fee.  I ask the Minister to address that point as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000017#P00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1621506000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I tend not to be overly partisan and I do not mean to be overly argumentative, but I think the comparison I made with the situation in Northern Ireland is fair.

The pandemic employment payment, PUP, was made available to students, the student assistance fund was doubled, 15,000 free laptops were provided, there was a &euro;250 top-up to the student grant scheme and the first increase in the postgraduate student supports in a decade.  We have done all this in a Department that is less than one year old.  We want to do much more in this area, but I think we have already shown a significant level of commitment to students.

I want to assure him that like the whole of Government, I am absolutely committed to a significant increase in on-site attendance in the further and higher education sectors in the next academic year.  We all know the reasons why students have had to attend online this year.  They have been well rehearsed and based on public health evidence.  However, we are also aware that it cannot be repeated.  It is not a sustainable situation to be in from an educational point of view, but more importantly, from a well-being perspective.  Our young people, in particular, need to be back in college.  It has been a hell of a long time since first-year students actually had on-site access to education, considering they left school - sixth year - in March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has established a working group.  It includes students, the unions, the representative bodies, NGOs and educational institutions.  The working group will prepare a plan for the new academic year.  It is due to meet again tomorrow to discuss the issue.  I will publish a plan for the new semester in June.<\/p>  <p>  Rapid antigen testing will form a part of that plan, but it is only one part of a package of measures that could support greater on-site activity.  A rapid testing study - pilots, as it were - will be rolled out across four universities this month: TCD, UCC, UCD and NUI Galway.  This will help us learn more about the potential role that rapid antigen can play in the further and higher education sector.  More broadly, perhaps those lessons can also be shared with other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also participating in a HSE antigen testing pilot working group which is working with the HSE on the piloting of antigen testing in the education sector, including at third level.  I am excited about antigen testing and eager to get the rapid testing pilots under way.  They are starting this month.  There is a commitment of funding of over &euro;1 million from my Department.  However, I want to be clear that rapid antigen testing is only one of the tools at our disposal.  The return to campus this autumn is not dependent on such testing.<\/p>  <p>  The adoption of detailed procedures and guidelines encompassing public health advice has played a central role in ensuring that essential and time-critical on-site activity could take place this year.

It is not a criticism of him specifically, but I believe that as a Government, we can do much more.  The dogs on the street know the pros and cons of rapid antigen testing.  It is not as accurate as PCR testing.  We understand that.  However, at the same time, looking at other developed countries, whether it is the UK or across Europe, there are hundreds of thousands of people who are subject to rapid testing every week.  The use of it across the Continent is identifying hundreds of thousands of cases when people are at their most infectious state.<\/p>  <p>  Given that come September the majority of adults here will be vaccinated, please God, in time for universities to return, if there is any delay in the vaccination roll-out it is most likely to affect third level students given that they are from younger age cohorts.

As the Deputy said, rapid testing is not PCR testing.  No one is suggesting that it is.

Examination of relevant issues raised in respect of PhD students arising from the information obtained on current practices will be undertaken by a sub-group of the advisory forum, so we are collating the information and asking the advisory forum to consider it.  We are specifically asking it to look at what happens in Ireland in light of international best practice in this area - how we benchmark what we do with others.

It is without doubt an issue all over the country.  It is at its most acute in the centre of Dublin, however.<\/p>  <p>  I can see the dilemma in my own constituency, particularly for a new younger generation.  We will not leave them behind, we will not leave them out, and we will do everything in our power to make sure they have the ability, as my own and previous generations did, including those in Dublin Bay South, to be able to afford a home.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look after people of all means, incomes and needs, particularly those in inner cities.  The current model is broken.  The market is not working and it will not fix this.  There has to be a radical change and we will help steer that change from within government.<\/p>  <p>  We started by increasing this year's budget by 25% up to &euro;3.3 billion, which I believe is a quarter of the entire capital budget.  We will not stop there.  We will need approximately &euro;120 billion over the next ten years.

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 will be able to help us on climate.  We need to put housing at centre stage and we need all Departments to act.<\/p>  <p>  We increased this year's capital budget, which is the key and real measure of what we can build and do.  We brought in a second measure, however.  I recall in the previous D&aacute;il, we were the first Opposition party that stood up and got cross-party agreement that we needed to switch to cost-rental housing as one of the ways to address this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In this year's budget, we acted and worked with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to say let us make it happen and start straightaway with eight projects we can start building, which are not just theoretical or abstract, and where we are calling from the sidelines, but actually start delivering.  That is only the start.  The reason cost rental is such a part of the solution is that it is social and public housing.  Rather than leased assets that go back to the private sector, the assets stay with our own public assets, on which we can build a long-term, sustainable financing model.  It takes time.<\/p>  <p>  We must be honest with our younger people that they and this housing issue are the first priority.  The benefit of cost rental is that it is in the market.  We can use public lands.  We can actually bring down the rental price.  That combined with affordable housing options, including the use of the serviced sites fund so that we actually reduce the cost, will be critical, particularly for urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  This is not one versus the other.  We particularly need to deliver on our national planning framework, which provides for high-quality homes and housing in urban areas, where people are there for life and have security of tenure.  It is not that the rental sector does not count; it does.  That applies to apartment ownership as well as renting.  We need a variety of different solutions.<\/p>  <p>  The key measures in the coming two months are the development of a new housing for all strategy that delivers on this, within which the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will be key.

We know what the Green Party policy is supposed to be.  It says it wants sustainable, high-quality developments that are located a 15-minute walk or cycle from a city centre.  However, does it only want people to be able to rent this kind of housing, and rent in insecure tenancies?  That is all that is available to people at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance tells us apartments must be omitted from the meagre measures announced this week that purport to stop the bulk purchase of homes by cuckoo funds because they will not otherwise be built.  Fine Gael has said something similar before.  Back in 2017, when Eoghan Murphy was Minister, he said he had to reduce design standards because apartments were too high-spec and were costing too much to build.  He slashed standards for every kind of apartment project but the changes he made for build-to-rent apartments were particularly damaging.  There is no restriction on dwelling mix.  The apartments are smaller and poorly ventilated at a time of a pandemic.  There is a complete lack of storage space, no private outdoor space and they are not at all suited to working from home.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Murphy was pleased with himself when those changes were made.  He claimed at the time he had single-handedly reduced the cost of delivering apartments by 15%.  He should perhaps have been concerned that developers and cuckoo funds were also very pleased with themselves.  Planning permissions in Dublin for apartments now vastly outstrip permissions for houses, and build-to-rent apartments comprise more than 70% of the permissions.  These apartments are cheaper to build, more expensive to rent and impossible to buy, a description that summarises the Government's housing policy very well.  Where are people who live in Dublin supposed to buy homes?  They cannot buy the apartments that are currently under construction because practically every one of them is being purchased by funds.  Eoghan Murphy's bright idea to slash costs for developers and cuckoo funds delivered for neither home buyers nor renters.  All it did was boost developers' profits.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's party, we were told, entered Government to have a positive impact on environmental issues.  I have some questions for him.  Why are he and his party facilitating this planning bonanza for cuckoo funds?  Does he accept that the Government is declaring Dublin city centre a no-go area for first-time buyers?  Is it not the case that young people who want to live in a city centre cannot aspire to home ownership?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000022#U01000","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We have to make housing affordable.  That is agreed and it is achieved by doing.  There is a variety of different investments we have to make.  We need to make significant investment in social housing at volume and at scale.  That involves large numbers and huge amounts of money.  The constraints in that regard are often not necessarily about the financing but getting the building workers with the training and skills, the blocklayers and so on.  We need to avoid the costs going up so much that it is expensive for everyone to build.  We need to do that so that we can build more.  It is about what we agreed the other night in terms of changing the Part V rules to say it is not just 10% social housing but we also want affordable purchase and cost rental.  That is significant.  We need the affordable purchase provision and the likes of the serviced sites fund to help bring down the cost, working with the local authorities.  The local authorities have a central role and we need to work with them on that.<\/p>  <p>  The coming months will be critical because the strategy and the plan have to be changed.  We need to change tack and do better.  The funding has to go in that direction and we will use our influence in government in that regard.  It is difficult because there are loads of funding requirements.  We are going to have to fund health, including Sl&aacute;intecare, education, climate and housing.  It is a challenge to get the balance right but we will fund affordable purchase housing as well as social housing.  I believe cost rental is critical because it fundamentally changes things.  The two tiers we have in Irish housing are around whether it is social or private.  The brilliant thing about cost rental is that it is between the two.  It is in the market but it is public.  I keep coming back to the Land Development Agency and the use of public land because I believe that is the key to help to unlock supply at scale.  I am talking about real ambition.  We are looking to influence, within the Government and with a cross-party approach, access to public lands.<\/p>  <p>  Critical to this, and I have to mention it at every stage because it is crucial it is recognised, is that housing and public transport go together.  To answer the Deputy's question about my vision for Dublin city, it is that we have a 15-minute city.  It will be an accessible city with everything close by and high-quality cycling and walking facilities as well as public transport infrastructure.  That needs to be funded.  There is a huge funding requirement if we are to build the likes of the metro, BusConnects and DART+ for Cork, Galway and Limerick as well as Dublin.  We need balanced regional development to make this work.  It has to include our other cities.  In the development of town centres, village centres and cities we need to go for compact development.  Housing, transport and local environment are key.<\/p>  <p>  We have a real role to offer and provide in terms of getting access to the land and getting an intervention on the sorts of measures I have mentioned.  There will also be private developments and there will be build-to-rent provision.  The &euro;120 billion we need to spend on housing in the next ten years will not all be from the Government.  If it were, we would not have the funding for transport, health and education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000022#U01100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000022#U01200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We need that balance and mix.

The provision of public transport is something that has been highlighted in my constituency, where in the recent past Bus &Eacute;ireann decided to cut back on some of the services it provides between Galway and Limerick.  That service is route 51.  It brings into focus the whole concept of providing public transport and how the National Transport Authority, NTA, which has the vested power to decide on these things, takes decisions to reduce services at a time when we are talking about climate action, bringing in a carbon tax and penalising people who have cars because they must pay more for fuel.  At the same time we are now taking away services from people who would otherwise go to work on these buses, either to Galway or Limerick.  If one takes Gort, Labane or Ardrahan, all of these areas are now affected by in that they do not have the same services they had.  Thus services are not available in the evening for people who want to come from work in Galway or Limerick back to south County Galway.  Likewise, Bus &Eacute;ireann removed bus stops in Kilreekil for no apparent reason, other than it said people were not using them, but we must incentivise people to use public transport.  We must also make it accessible to people with disabilities.  How is this to be changed?<\/p>  <p>  I have spent much time working with Local Link in County Galway, trying to create routes to feed into bus and train services, yet every proposal we put in is turned down by the NTA.  I had very good proposals from the Caherlistrane-Headford area, and from Corrandulla to feed into this, to take cars off the road and get people to go to work on buses.  The public transport is not there; it is not being provided.  People are scratching there heads and thinking that they still need the car and that it is essential.  The message coming from Bus &Eacute;ireann to people in my constituency is that they must continue to use the car even more because the public transport will not be provided.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we look at this when we are talking about climate action.  I know well the Minister wants to deliver on public transport but we must see a plan on how that is going to be done so that in our constituencies we can tell people that this is the service they are going to get.  Public transport is going to take cars off the road.  If we are going to work with that, we need to start now and reverse the decision made by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000023#V00500","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Following on from the previous question, there is a lot of emphasis on urban Ireland because of the issue of apartment living.  We must be very clear that in the changes we need to make, it is about rural and urban.  It is about towns and villages, country and city.  This is particularly the case with meeting the climate change challenges we face where we need a switch to public transport and to reduce the demand to travel by creating services in our towns, so everything is close by and people do not have to travel all the time.  However, as well as the commitment to housing mentioned earlier, this requires a commitment to public transport.  Again, in the context of the Covid crisis, we should look at the figures.  The spending is mainly because of the crisis but it is still an indication this is important.  In 2019, &euro;300 million was spent on subventing public transport.  That increased to &euro;610 million last year and &euro;650 million this year.  The rural bus services are particularly important because as the Deputy said, there are many people who do not have access a car and who have just as much of a right and entitlement to be able to move around, get to the hospital, to other appointments or to wherever they need to go to.<\/p>  <p>  One good bit of news is that I met the commercial bus operators.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also runs these kind of commercial operations with specific supports to keep them going.  I refer not just to the public service obligation, PSO, services but also commercial operators because they were in real difficulty during the Covid crisis.  I met them in recent months.  The support was due to come to an end and they asked that I keep it going for another few months because we are coming to the end of this, lockdown is starting to ease and we do not want to fall at the last hurdle and lose services at the last minute.  I talked to the NTA, as did the industry groups.  I was very glad to commit to extending that into the summer months, so we do not have a cliff edge in support for public bus services.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a key role.  It is true the company is changing the routes, adding some new routes and taking some services from others; it must manage that as it sees fit.  It is also operating these services, the likes of route 51, in a commercial market where there are a lot of private operators as well.  Bus &Eacute;ireann must allocate on the basis of where it sees it can best meet customer demand.  We have given a clear commitment that a reduction in services cannot be done where it leaves people without a commensurate service, be that private or otherwise, so we will not leave people without.<\/p>  <p>  I have another bit of news, which is a positive development.  To take up what Deputy Canney said about Local Link and the need for additional services, recognising that and that we need to change and be more efficient is important, the NTA has been working with Leitrim County Council on a pilot scheme I hope to announce shortly.  It would be for three years and would look at a really innovative way of combining our HSE public transport services with Local Link and bus services so we start developing new rural bus transport services.  Let us not do it the way we always did but look to innovate and try to create new services.  It has not been announced yet but I hope it will be really significant for the people of County Leitrim.  There is potential if the pilot works for it to be spread elsewhere, whereby we increase, enhance and allow the people of rural Ireland make the switch to a better system using public transport in a low-emissions world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000023#V00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621509600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and welcome his announcement about the pilot scheme for County Leitrim.  I agree we cannot have more of the same, where there is a mismatch.  We must start with the very basics, look at where the rural populations are, where they are migrating to work, how they are going to work and how they come back home in the evenings.  If Members listen to the AA Ireland traffic reports, they will hear about Claregalway.  Every evening we hear about Bothar na dTreabh in Galway.  The people who are causing the congestion, if I can put it that way, are the workers from the east of the county who are trying to access the city.  We must provide the services so they can access the city in a different way.  Some of the finest private bus operators are operating from east County Galway to bring people into the city.  However, we cannot get a bus lane built from Claregalway into Galway.  It has been planned for maybe the last ten years and still is not done.  It is a very simple process as there is no land acquisition required; it is just a question of getting it done.

They were finding that as soon as they put new routes on, customer demand was rising to meet them; they were on a big expansion plan.  I hope we can get back to that.<\/p>  <p>  A connected issue with respect to what we must do in transport to have a low-emissions future is in our roads programme, which will still be significant.  Our public transport programme will be bigger and be enhanced but it is also important we maintain roads and build new roads to get over where we have pinch points and problems.  As we look at this climate plan, I have been saying that within the roads programme, we must really focus on bypasses of towns, and a large number of them.  They do not have to be big motorways or huge expensive projects.  We can spend our money wisely and have it go further and be spent more widely by doing a whole series of small bypasses.  These will often be single carriageway but they will get traffic out of the bottleneck.

There is no dual aspect for the properties and little communal space or storage.

We need to provide housing for young people and it must be close to the city centre, of high quality and in large numbers.  The strategic housing development approach will not continue after early next year.  It will be wound down and it will mean we will, correctly, have to rely on our councils to get much of this right.  The council must deliver a range of other services, as well as housing, to get the balance right for good quality living.  This means there should be local green space, good bus services, local shops and community centres, as well as work near by.  It is balanced development, which means it is not all housing in one place and work somewhere else.  We want mixed development and we can get it right.<\/p>  <p>  Height is probably the most contentious issue right across the city, particularly now.  We cannot keep going up.  I rely a lot in this regard on the likes of Ciaran Cuffe MEP whom the Deputy will know from the council and who has real planning expertise.  He makes the point that the sense of community weakens slightly when buildings go over a certain height.  This is site-specific and it depends on neighbours, for example.  Costs also go up when heights increase.  There is a balance to be struck.  This might be four, five or six storeys.  Other cities do it, and the likes of Paris and Barcelona, which are historically famous, get the balance right between density and quality.  There is a sense of connection or community that may be lost when we go with some of the really high developments that have been suggested.<\/p>  <p>  We need density, though, and this sometimes requires difficult decisions.  We also need other services that require difficult decisions.  The BusConnects project is on my desk and I hope that can go to planning very shortly.  That will be key in bringing down cost.  For example, we do not need car parking for everyone.  If we thought about this and designed projects well, we could reduce cost of apartments by not having to build expensive and extensive car parking but rather having other solutions to give people a really high quality of life.  We must get that mix or balance right.<\/p>  <p>  This is not easy and no one idea for what we need to do might have more virtue than another idea.  I agree with the Deputy's basic premise.

It is also noticeable when we look at the research statistics that there has been an amazing increase in the amount spent on special needs education in our country, be it on special needs assistants, special teachers or special schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>However, there are gaps and if Dublin 15 is one of these then absolutely we need to close them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>It is very important that we protect every child in the way we manage this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000026#Y01600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621511400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I want to raise the employment of behavioural analysts who, as with other key members of staff in education, are being taken over by the Department of Education and brought into the public sector system.

Yesterday, at the start of my intervention, I welcomed this Bill and I thanked the Minister of State for bringing it forward.  It is good legislation which protects the productive income from the farm or business and that is what is most important.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that if someone has been in care for over three years, once he or she appoints a successor, he or she will no longer have to pay the 7.5% contribution based on his or her asset.  If someone is in care for two years and ten months and appoints a successor, does he or she have to pay just the two months or the entire three years to bring it up to the three-year cap?  I do not know the answer to that question and I hope the Minister of State will clarify this for me in her reply.  I hope it is the latter case.<\/p>  <p>  I want to return to an issue I have spoken about before, which is the increasing challenges being faced by private nursing homes, especially some smaller ones in rural areas.  We are talking about a fair deal, so it has to be a fair deal for everybody.  The average weekly fee in 2018 for public nursing homes was &euro;1,564, whereas it was &euro;968 for private nursing homes.  I recognise in some specific cases, those with more complex needs may be more likely to be cared for in a public nursing home.  Nonetheless, the vast majority of people are being cared for in their locality.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, public nursing homes cost the State 60% more in County Sligo, 68% more in County Leitrim, 70% more in County Roscommon and 81% more in County Donegal.  All nursing homes, public or private, must operate to the same standards and I am not, for one instance, suggesting we pay public nursing homes less, but we have to look at paying private nursing homes more.<\/p> <p>Back in 2015, a review of systems for setting prices under the nursing homes support scheme was set up by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  It was supposed to report back in 2017.  Before Christmas, I asked the T&aacute;naiste why that report had not been published.  I still do not know why, and it still has not been published today.  Why is that?  It seems fundamentally unjust to commission a review of pricing policy in the sector in 2015 and to leave nursing home owners waiting on its recommendations six years later.  It was needed then; it would not have been commissioned if it was not.<br\/><br\/>The truth is that many of those private nursing home owners are barely hanging on.  I have spoken to many of them in my constituency and they are under serious pressure financially.  They cannot compete with the HSE when it comes to terms and conditions for their staff, even though they want to do so because they have top-class staff.  They have difficulty in retaining staff.  If some of those nursing homes close, the State will have to step in, which will mean greater cost to the taxpayer.  Foreign investment is already coming into the sector.  I am not saying it is like the housing sector but there are parallels.  That is not negative in itself but it changes the dynamic.  We need to take a more holistic view of our procurement model and we must never equate value for money with a race to the bottom.  I am not saying that is happening; I am just sounding warning bells.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister of State to publish the review of the systems for setting prices under the nursing homes support scheme.  I have given plenty of anecdotal evidence about the need for that review to be published and acted upon, and I am sure other Deputies will do the same, but I am not just relying on anecdotal evidence.  I have read HIQA's yearly overview reports and what they say is very clear.  The 2017 report notes:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn 2017, five registered providers advised HIQA that they had made a decision to close their nursing home.  The five nursing homes [were] all small centres with less than 40 residents... <\/blockquote> <p>In 2018, HIQA stated that &quot;smaller nursing homes &mdash; which often provide a more homely environment &mdash; are closing voluntarily due to concerns over their financial viability.&quot;  The 2019 report read:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe nursing home sector in Ireland has changed considerably in terms of the size of new centres ... [and many of] these new centres are largely concentrated in the east of the country, particularly in Dublin.  At the same time, smaller centres are closing across the country, presenting a challenge to rural communities.  <\/blockquote> <p>It is happening.  We need a vision for the sector and that vision must be underpinned by the resources necessary to deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000029#EE00400","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621513200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>The traffic in Dublin nearly had me beaten.  I welcome the Bill.  There is one issue I would like the Minister of State to clarify.  My office has been onto her's about it already.  Will people who have been in nursing homes for three to five years so far be covered under the three-year rule straight away when the legislation comes in?  Going by what she has said, they will have to be there three years starting now.  That is a pity because many people in farming and business are financially stretched at the moment and their next of kin are paying large amounts for nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  This is a progressive step forward.  Rural Deputies from all sides have been lobbying for this change for the past four or five years.  It is welcome because it will take pressure off families down the road.  We have to remember that a business or a farm is like a torch for people to hand on.  The situation that had evolved was that someone could have a house worth &euro;1 million somewhere and once the three years were up it would be gone out the window.  However, if that person had a farm or a business, the rate was 7% a year and that kept going for whatever length of time.  It is great that those people were living a good while but the longer they lived another 7% was defrayed and the State would end up owning the farm or the business.  I ask the Minister of State to look again at people who have been in homes for the past three years.  People are paying for their loved ones for eight or ten years and that has put a fair amount of financial pressure on them.  Farming or running a business is not the simplest thing in the world at the best of times and it puts big financial pressure on people but it also keeps them in their community and keeps them in employment.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I would like the Minister of State to look at, and she probably will because we were on a group regarding to it previously, is helping local communities to keep a nucleus of people from the area in one-bedroom or two-bedroom chalets.  That way, one carer or nurse could call to them and they would stay in their communities for as long as possible.  We are well aware that it would not work for everybody but it might help people with Alzheimer's and so on, and new technologies could be used to keep them safe and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the issue of carers and the hours and hours that sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles spend looking after their loved ones in houses around this country.  I have seen people working in Dublin give up their jobs to go down the country to look after their mother or father, and because they had a house here in Dublin, they had to get it assessed and all that craic.  They get damn all, to be quite frank about it.  It would be helpful if we could look at that situation.  I welcome the Bill and I know the Minister of State had a personal interest in it.  I ask her to look at the issues I talked about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000030#FF00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1621513200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I pay tribute and thanks to all the staff and support workers in our nursing homes and community hospitals who have taken care of many of our elderly family members over these difficult and sometimes lonely times during the past year and throughout the pandemic.  These were very difficult times for residents, who were isolated from their loved ones and family members.  The staff provided security, comfort and care to many of our family members.  I am glad that visits have now been restored on a phased basis to those family members we have missed so much.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, which has taken some time to come to fruition.  It was included in both this and the previous programme for Government.  Since the commencement of the nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme as it is more widely known, farmers and small businesses have raised concerns about the charges on their farms or family business assets under this scheme.  Some compared it to the death duties that were abolished decades ago.  Those charges were abolished because families often had to sell the family farm or small business to pay taxes, which left the younger members of the family without an income or a home.<\/p> <p>The family farm or small family business is not used as a capital asset to transfer wealth from one generation to the next, but rather as a means to provide an income for hard work, often undertaken 365 days of the year.  We must remember that according to the IFA only 34% of family farms provide a viable income.  This Bill recognises that fact.  Inheriting a farm is not a road to riches and wealth, but an invitation to work hard for many years to earn enough to provide for one's family and the next generation.  <\/p> <p> The need for a scheme such as this has come about mainly due to improvements in our health services, which has increased life expectancy for all our people.  It was not long ago that average life expectancy in Ireland was in the mid-to-late 60s, but it is now in the mid 80s.  Those born in Ireland today are forecast to have a life expectancy closer to 100 years of age.  The nursing home support scheme, sometimes referred to as the fair deal scheme, is a scheme of financial support for people who need long-term nursing home care.  Under the scheme, a person contributes towards the cost of care and the State pays the balance.  The fair deal scheme represents an annual investment of &euro;1.4 billion by the State and it benefits more than 22,000 people.  <\/p> <p> I am proud to say that the changes included in this Bill were adopted by the Government led by Fine Gael in July 2018, on foot of the proposal from my former colleague, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, former Deputy Jim Daly.  He stated at the time that these changes would take away a great deal of stress and worry from affected families and allow them to plan for the future, while allowing them to continue to run family business without the fear of losing it.  <\/p> <p> I mentioned earlier that this Bill has taken some time to come before the House.  I understand that a review of the scheme was published in 2015 by the coalition Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The review recommended reconsidering how productive assets were dealt with in the scheme.  The process of reforming this scheme has taken more than seven years, and during that time many families have endured extreme hardship in meeting these charges.  Often, they have had to sell parts or all of their family farms, or businesses, which may have been worked on by those families for generations.  <\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State consider setting up a hardship fund that would repay or not levy some of these charges?  I refer to the possibility of it being necessary to sell some farm or business assets to meet these charges and, in that context, the need to ensure these family farms are viable for the next generation.  This Bill addresses possible funding and how charges can be levied for nursing home care in respect of farmers and their spouses.  However, another group at the heart of the scheme should also be considered for special treatment.  Recently, I raised with the Minister of State some concerns from nurses regarding their pay and working conditions, including the Haddington Road agreement and registration charges.  No one doubts that nurses were on the front line and carried out sterling work in the last year when providing treatment during the pandemic.  They are also at the very heart of the nursing home care system.  There is consensus among people that nurses are undervalued and underpaid in our health system.  There is also a similar consensus that they played a vital role in the treatment of many of our elderly people during the worst days of the pandemic.  <\/p> <p> There is a belief that the Trojan efforts and contributions of nurses must be recognised and rewarded.  While I understand the complications and knock-on effects associated with giving a special pay award, I suggest that we might be able to examine other factors in respect of their pay and conditions of employment.  One possibility might be for us to examine the possibility of offering a special deal to nurses.  I would love to think that we could introduce amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage to provide for a special treatment package under the nursing home support scheme for nurses who have worked so hard during this pandemic.  One potential proposal would be to look at the three-year rule for charging.  It might be possible to change that criterion to a two-year charge for the first year.  However, that is only one potential method that could be applied.  The Minister of State and her advisers may be able to come up with some other package to demonstrate our nation's gratitude to all nurses who have worked on the front line during this horrific pandemic.  I support this Bill and I hope the Minister of State and her advisers might take on board some of my suggestions, as well as amendments, on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000030#FF00300","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621513800,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We have all seen how challenging Covid-19 has been for older people, those living on their own and people living in nursing homes.  Nursing homes are at the heart of their respective communities, meeting the vital healthcare requirements of a cohort of our society during a difficult time in their and their families' lives.  Nursing homes are very much a home away from home and a safe place in which loved ones can be cared for.  The major increase in our older population will present big challenges for our healthcare services within our regions.  It is crucial that public investment in long-term care services is maintained for those who need it.<\/p>  <p>  Care must remain accessible and affordable, including for those families with a farm or business.  I have been saying for a long time that the fair deal scheme needed to be fairer, and now it is.  I met many farming families who told me of their concerns regarding how they were assessed.  I welcome the fact that after three years the value of family-owned farms will no longer be considered when calculating the cost of care for people in nursing homes, where a family successor commits to working on the farm or in the business and allowing them to be passed down to the next generation.  That is an important point.  Farming is part of our history and culture, and in that context we must ensure that we get this legislation right.  I am delighted with this Bill because it will protect our family farms and businesses.  By inserting additional safeguards to the scheme, the Bill will promote and protect the sustainability of family farms and businesses.  It will ensure they are not consigned to the history books.<\/p>  <p>  Updating the nursing home support scheme legislation to enhance protection for farmers and business owners was an absolute priority for the Minister of State and I applaud her for her work.  This legislation has been her priority since she became a Minister of State, and especially in recent months.  I have spoken with her several times and I know she has faced many obstacles, but this is a really good Bill and it is good for our farmers and businesses.  This is what we must do to protect the most vulnerable in our society.  The Minister of State shares my desire to find ways to support and enable older people to live in their own homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible.  In that context, this again is a great Bill and I support it.  However, we all know we must do more when it comes to achieving the goal of finding better ways of enabling our population to stay at home while ageing.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been speaking to families and many of them would like to have their elderly parents in their homes.  This aspect is a priority for the Minister of State, and we must look at more supports in that regard, including more funding and full-time care.  It is a matter for another day, but I ask the Minister of State to examine that area as well.  We are lucky that people are living longer.  It is great to see that happening.  My mother at home is 86 and my sister is her carer.  We are so lucky.  They have had all their vaccines now as well, which is great.  I got my vaccine yesterday, and I am delighted.  Things are changing.  <\/p>  <p>  I compliment everybody involved in nursing homes.  It has been such a difficult time.  The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been very hard on nursing homes, but they have been absolutely brilliant.  We must express our thanks to all those involved for what they have done for elderly people.  It is important that we do that.  We appreciate all that has been done and we must show that.  Life is precious, and if we have learned anything from Covid-19 it is that we must make the best of what we have and try to work with, be kind to and look after people.<\/p> <p>It is the Minister of State's role, as she has responsibility for older people, to put their needs first.  I thank her for that.<\/p> <p> We have discussed the issue of rental income in respect of the fair deal scheme.  That is an issue for another day.  <\/p> <p> This Bill is to be welcomed.  I have spoken to many family farmers in my own area of Carlow and they are delighted with this Bill.  They feel that they have been waiting a long time for it.  Indeed, it has been in the pipeline for some time.  Now it is here.  This Bill shows that we, in Fianna F&aacute;il and in government, are committed to looking after our older people.<\/p> <p> I have only question left for the Minister of State.  What is the timescale with the Bill?  I am delighted that many of the parties are supporting the Bill.  As it is such an important Bill, I am wondering about the timescale.  It is important that we try to get it through the House as soon as possible.  Perhaps the Minister of State can write to me, providing me with details of a timescale and how long the process will take.  I urge the Government and all Members to get this legislation through the House as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> I wish to thank everyone involved, including the Department and the Minister of State, for putting such hard work into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000031#GG00200","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621514400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  It aims to limit the period for including the value of family farms or businesses to three years for financial assessment under the fair deal scheme, where the family successor continues to operate the farm or business for six years and takes over the running of the farm or business within three years.  It is, indeed, a welcome reform.<\/p><p>However,  it is a real shame that the Bill does not address some of the other issues with the scheme that I and others have been highlighting for several years.  For a number of years, I have sought to find a way to stop the double charging of residents of private nursing homes for items and services to which they are entitled as medical card holders.  This practice goes on in many nursing homes where elderly residents or their families have to pay for items as basic as wound dressings, certain medications, sanitary products and services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  If these residents were living in the community, these would be provided free of charge under the medical card scheme.  The legislation states that this should not happen, but in practice, residents have to sign contracts that include clauses allowing nursing homes to charge them for these items and services.  These residents need the nursing home care; they have no choice but to sign the contract.  I have highlighted this matter repeatedly to the Government, but it has failed to address it or even to acknowledge that it is a serious problem for some people who have to pay enormous bills for items that should be provided free of charge.<\/p><p>That is only one issue that needs to be addressed.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I know only too well that there are significant shortcomings in how the fair deal scheme is run.  Last October. we raised the fact that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which decides what price nursing homes will charge patients in private and voluntary nursing homes, had <i>ad hoc<\/i>and inconsistent record keeping, which meant that the process was not transparent in some cases.  We know that the maximum price decided upon for a patient's care is always the actual price.  That is not acceptable.<\/p><p>We also know that when some assessments are done, the process of checking when properties and other assets were signed over to family members is not thorough, meaning that people who hastily sign over assets a year or two before they join the scheme often do not pay the correct amount as the scheme is unaware of the actual value of assets they owned.  <\/p><p>We also know that some private nursing homes will not accept certain high-dependency residents, particularly those who are very unwell, or have significant impairments.  The public nursing homes often look after these residents, which places an unfair burden on them.<\/p><p>We have been told that some of these are being addressed and the committee will continue to work on these issues.  However, I have seen no evidence that any of these issues have been addressed.  <\/p><p>I hope that this Bill is only a first step in addressing some of the problems with the fair deal scheme, as a huge number of people rely on it.  It has to be fair and work for as many people as possible.  <\/p><p>I take issue, in particular, with the charging of residents who are in possession of a medical card for items and services.  If they were living in the community, they would be entitled to those products, medicines and therapies free of charge.  However, because they are in private nursing homes and have signed contracts, they are being charged.  If the residents cannot afford to pay, their families must pay.  I came across a family facing a bill of almost &euro;1,500 for a one-year period.  That is unfair.  The resident in question was entitled to all of the items for which the family was being charged under the medical card scheme.  If there is one issue that I ask the Minister of State to tackle from today onwards, it is that.  It is wrong. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000032#HH00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1621514400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I also wish to welcome this Bill.  It is a resolution of sorts to what has been fundamental unfairness in the so-called fair deal scheme.  It has affected farming families, in particular.  In capping the contributions at three years as they relate to family farms, the scheme now essentially reflects the reality that in many cases, family farms are extensions of the family homes rather than a speculative asset that is hoarded or treated as a business or other type of asset.  That is most important.<\/p>  <p>  My regret, which I believe is shared by many in this House, is that we are so late in bringing the legislation to this point.  My fundamental regret is that the people who have highlighted this anomaly and campaigned for changes in the legislation will not get the benefit of it.  Those people who have been in nursing home care for more than three years will not receive a rebate.  I appeal to all parties to work as hard as possible and explore every avenue with a view to finding a legal basis by which the issue can be resolved so that those people can get their payments back.  Undoubtedly, if that is not the case, farm holdings will be lost to families who simply do have the resources to pay the nursing home care bill.<\/p>  <p>  While the resolution makes the fair deal scheme fairer, it still does not make it an entirely fair deal.  In bringing this Bill to Committee Stage, I urge all parties to reflect on the stories that we have heard from our constituencies and ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>  <p>  It is a good opportunity for us to reflect on how we deal with legislation that comes before the House, particularly from Departments that may not have an explicit responsibility for rural communities.  The difficulty with the original legislation is that it was adopted without any consideration as to what it might mean for farm families.  We are only now getting to the point where that is being addressed.  The Deputies will be aware that Sinn F&eacute;in has been trying to pass what is referred to as \"rural equality legislation\" in this House since 2015.  Most recently, the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy for the Roscommon-Galway constituency, Deputy Kerrane, brought legislation before the House that is designed to essentially ensure that every Bill passed is \"rural-proofed\", for want of a better term.  It involves assessing what the legislation might mean, and what its implications might be, for the rural communities that we know are struggling in many ways.  In the past, this legislation has been opposed by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I encourage Members to work with us to ensure that that Bill can be brought through this House and passed to make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>  <p>  I also support Deputy Munster's call for focus to be placed on addressing anomalies in nursing home care.  We need to move to a point where we actually have publicly-provided nursing home care.  Just like all other forms of healthcare, nursing home care should not be driven by motivations of profit; rather it should be considered to be a fundamental part of our healthcare system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000032#HH00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621514400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Situation in Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel: Statements","time":1621515000,"counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000033#JJ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1621515000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Carroll MacNeill.<\/p><p>We are here this afternoon to address the current cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.  It is the latest in a long, brutal and inhumane conflict that has taken an unspeakable human toll.  This week, I have spoken about the situation in the Seanad, at the UN Security Council and in a meeting of EU foreign ministers.  I repeat here my calls for an immediate cessation of violence.  Indiscriminate rocket attacks from Gaza must stop.  Israeli air strikes must stop.  Over 120 civilians in the Gaza Strip have been killed in the last ten days, 63 of them children.  Among the 12 civilians killed in Israel, two were children.  This is shameful and will reinforce and embed hatred, grief and a continuance of what drives this conflict into the future.  Today, as we debate in this Chamber, 57,000 people have been displaced by hostilities in Gaza and are now taking refuge in almost 60 schools, many of them UN facilities, in an effort to find safe refuge for themselves, their families and their children.  The protection of civilians must be paramount.  The impact on civilians, particularly children, has been simply unacceptable and the international community must call it out.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I spoke to the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Shtayyeh, and expressed Ireland's condolences on the deaths and violence of the past week.  Ireland has been urging the UN Security Council to use its voice.  The council has met four times since the outbreak of hostilities.  I must be honest that I find it difficult to comprehend how the UN Security Council has not yet been able to agree a clear joint statement on this issue.  The global structure for preventing conflict and bringing conflict to an end has been unable until now to call for a ceasefire on a conflict as significant as this one.  I addressed the UN Security Council on Sunday and underlined that we need to send a clear and united message that the council and its members have a responsibility to speak.  Ireland is working closely with France on intensive negotiations in New York today to agree a Security Council resolution.  I will be meeting later this afternoon in Dublin with my French counterpart on this issue.  I sincerely hope that all council members will come to the table constructively to try and reach agreement.  The UN Security Council must speak on this issue.<\/p><p>The President of the UN General Assembly has also convened the General Assembly today.  This reflects the widespread concern among UN member states.  The conflict is of particular concern to neighbouring states, many of which have been at the forefront of efforts to try to secure a ceasefire in recent days.  I have been in close contact with my counterparts in the region, be it in Egypt, Qatar or Jordan.  I have urged all states to use their influence with parties to support efforts to end hostilities.  Yesterday, I met the Foreign Minister of Iran, Mr. Zarif.  I made the point clearly to him that Iran has a responsibility to use its influence in the Gaza Strip to insist on a ceasefire and an ending of violence and the firing of rockets.  EU foreign ministers met virtually on Tuesday in an emergency setting.  I called for a clear EU message in support of an immediate ceasefire and for humanitarian access to Gaza.  I welcome the clear call from the High Representative, Mr. Josep Borrell, for a cessation of violence, for the implementation of a ceasefire in order to protect civilians and for full humanitarian access to be given to those most in need in Gaza.<\/p><p>Beyond securing a ceasefire and humanitarian access, we must also address the root causes of this ongoing cycle of violence.  I was clear about this at the Foreign Affairs Council on Tuesday.  The EU has a responsibility to step up.  This is in our neighbourhood and we must be a much more influential actor than we are currently.  As I said, this afternoon I will meet my French counterpart, Mr. Jean-Yves Le Drian.  We will discuss how we can work together at both EU and UN Security Council levels to support all efforts to de-escalate and, looking ahead, how we can reinvigorate the international community's commitment to the Middle East peace process and restart badly needed negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians on the basis of equality of esteem, which we have not seen for a number of years.<\/p><p>The loss of life, destruction and trauma we have seen in the last week across Israel and Palestine have been horrifying, but must be a wake-up call for the international community in terms of its responsibilities.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the Gaza Strip, where 2 million people were already living in acute humanitarian need and suffering the consequences of repeated cycles of violence and long-running blockades.  That is why I have announced an immediate response of &euro;1.5 million in emergency supports for the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip.  Irish Aid will support the UN in delivering emergency humanitarian supplies to those who most need them.  Some &euro;1 million will be provided to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, which provides services to Palestinian refugees, for emergency food, water and sanitation supplies and health and psychosocial services for 50,000 people sheltered in UNRWA-run schools.  The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, will also receive &euro;500,000 for child protection and medical and sanitation services for thousands of children in acute need.  This includes emergency psychosocial services to 5,000 children suffering trauma as a result of hostilities.  We will respond further to the humanitarian situation in the weeks ahead.  This money is additional to the money we already provide to organisations such as UNRWA and other UN actors.<\/p><p>While much of the focus today is rightly on the violence and tension in Gaza, the West Bank and across Israel, we cannot and must not shy away from the enabling factors in this recent tragic cycle of violence.  I have to say that they are primarily Israel's continued strategy of expanding settlements and the discriminatory practices by Israeli authorities against Palestinians, with forced relocation, demolition of properties, forced evictions and continuing to expand settlements that are not legal in the first place.  Once the immediate hostilities have ended, we cannot go back to the <i>status quo<\/i>of a few weeks ago.  I remain supportive of a two-state solution, but it cannot be delivered if Israel&rsquo;s actions on settlements, demolition and evictions continue unabated.  Brutality and dispossession will not lead to a peaceful, secure outcome for anyone, either for Palestinians in a future state of their own or for Israelis who want to live in peace with their neighbours as well.<\/p><p>Ireland will continue to use its voice at the Security Council to draw attention to these issues.  We will speak up even if it is not comfortable to do so.  We will continue, along with our EU partners, to engage in renewed and reinvigorated international and regional efforts, which are more necessary now than they have been for many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000033#JJ00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1621515000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for sharing his time.

Homes, media offices, libraries, police stations, a university, nine primary healthcare centres, six hospitals, the main Covid-19 laboratory and the office of the ministry of health have been deliberately destroyed.  Those are all grave breaches of the Geneva Convention or, in other words, war crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Like all witnesses, we face the challenge to act under our moral obligation to attempt to put an end to this onslaught or to retreat into the role of passive observer.  The Irish Government has adopted an approach that perhaps can be best described as straddling the two in its attempt to achieve consensus that has no chance of success.  The deck is stacked.  All attempts to achieve consensus are doomed to failure when allies of Israel cynically employ their veto at the UN and within the EU to prevent anything that could resemble a coherent approach emerging.  Thus, we are morally, ethically and justifiably compelled to act unilaterally.<\/p>  <p>  In the dark days of South African apartheid, Ireland, spurred by the passion of the ordinary people of Ireland as epitomised by the Dunnes Stores strikers, was proud to act in support of the victims of state oppression and discrimination in South Africa.  What has changed?  Human Rights Watch, an internationally respected organisation, recently laid the accusation of the crime of apartheid against the Israeli state, an allegation backed by the most irrefutable of evidence.  The Government of Israel has been engaged in a systematic campaign of absolute domination over the Palestinian peoples for decades.  Human Rights Watch, along with reports from other human rights groups such as Al-Haq and B'Tselem, have called this out now, which is welcome.  However, the reports, in conjunction with the latest round of attacks on the Palestinian people, must be seen as a catalyst for action.<\/p>  <p>  The current violence is not taking place in a vacuum.  It is the product of 54 years of Israeli colonisation of Palestine.  Since 1967, 250 illegal Israeli settlements have been created on Palestinian lands, now inhabited by more than 650,000 illegal Israeli settlers.<\/p> <p>This is an Israeli strategy of remove, fragment and replace, designed to allow Israeli settlers to seize the maximum amount of Palestinian land for themselves while locking the remaining Palestinian people into a patchwork collection of Bantustans.  This is apartheid in practice.<\/p> <p> It is a fact that 83% of all demolitions of Palestinian buildings take place within a 2.5 km range of Israeli settlements.  When I say buildings, I am describing homes, schools, health centres and basic critical infrastructure funded by the Irish taxpayer and other donors.<\/p> <p> In 2020, 848 Palestinian homes were destroyed, impacting on 6,380 Palestinians, including 534 children.  Up to 30 April this year, 316 buildings were destroyed.  This represents an increase of 108% on figures from 2020.<\/p> <p> The human cost of this is catastrophic.  Thousands are left homeless, hopeless, and destitute.  Very often, following the destruction of schools, young children are forced to travel 14 to 15 miles to schools, during which they often have to pass by the illegal Israeli settlements.<\/p> <p> It is time for action.  We can issue all the statements we want.  The statements that have been issued would plaster the walls of the convention centre but it has zero impact on the illegal aggression by the Israeli state.  We can and must take action.  Ireland must be prepared to act alone on this when the international community has failed the Palestinian people.<\/p> <p> We must officially recognise the Palestinian state.  We must also move to bring forward the occupied territories Bill and recognise the fact that annexation is happening as we speak in East Jerusalem and in the occupied West Bank territories.  We must act, and if that means acting unilaterally, we must do so, otherwise, we are failing on our human rights and our obligations to the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000034#KK00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621516200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Gaza is a tiny enclave 41 km long and 11 km at its widest point.  It has endured a military and economic blockade since 2007, effectively imprisoning almost two million people in an area the size of 362 sq. km.<\/p>  <p>  For almost two weeks now, this third most densely populated spot in the world has been under sustained and shocking bombardment by one of the best armed military forces on the planet.  We know that at least 230 Palestinians are dead, including 65 children, which I read as I came into the Chamber.  The rockets launched by Hamas against Israel have killed ten people, including two children, and two other Israelis have also died in civil unrest.<\/p>  <p>  The scenes emerging on our televisions have horrified all right-thinking people.  We expect a ceasefire to be agreed, particularly after the intervention of the US President, Joe Biden, this week.  We also know, however, that actual ceasefire will not come about until the Israeli military is satisfied that it has bombed and destroyed every target it wishes to.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister said, a ceasefire is and must be our first priority.  The first thing we must achieve internationally is to stop the killing, but what then?  Do we refocus on other issues until the next flare-up of violence or do we seek now to join anyone willing to join us in taking a stand?<\/p>  <p>  The international community has an understood settlement for the Israeli-Palestinian disagreement, which is two separate sovereigns states, Israel and Palestine, both with sustainable and viable territories and borders, sharing Jerusalem as their capital.  On occasions in the 1990s, this objective was thought to be within our grasp.  Now, it has been systematically undermined by years of Israeli settlement in Palestinian territories.  It has been undermined to the point that many academics and politicians alike have despaired of its implementability.  The viability of a Palestinian state is now in question because of the obvious policy of Israel to dismantle it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has sought to build a common position internationally, on which I commend him, at the United Nations, where the United States prevents any consensus emerging in the Security Council, and in the EU, where countries like Hungary prevent a common position emerging.  So be it; it is time for Ireland to act.<\/p>  <p>  During last week's Priority Questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I said there must be a consequence for the outrageous actions we see, which assault human rights and all international norms, and not the normal verbal condemnations but concrete actions.<\/p>  <p>  Today, Norway's sovereign wealth fund dropped two companies that were involved in the development of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are called Shapir Engineering and Industry Ltd. and Mivne Real Estate KD Ltd.<\/p>  <p>  We, too, must take a lead in meaningful economic sanctions aimed at any company, individual or state entity that violates international law by supporting or facilitating illegal settlements.  The rights and legal entitlements of an entire nation cannot simply be extinguished by a sustained, deliberate and relentless policy of dispossession, eviction and suppression.<\/p>  <p>  The only hope for long-term and sustainable peace, as we in Ireland know only too well, is to provide a basis for both communities to coexist, with equal rights, as citizens of two separate nations.  The real security rightly sought by the people of Israel can only be guaranteed when an acceptable settlement, not one forced by strength of arms, is mutually agreed by both sides.  I believe the people of Ireland want their Government and their Parliament to act now to build the international pressure to bring this about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000035#LL00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins is sharing time with Deputy Cahill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000035#LL00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516200,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I wish to begin by condemning the violence in Palestine and Israel.  I have stood in the West Bank and in places like Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah.  I have crossed the border at Kulandia and gone through the checkpoint alone in the darkness of night.<\/p>  <p>  I stood in Hebron during Passover when hundreds of heavily armed Israeli soldiers burst out from a military zone into a Palestinian town.  I watched helplessly as those Israeli soldiers banged on the doors of Palestinian homes, gained entry into people's houses and illegal access onto the roof in order that their snipers could, from afar, police what was going on below.  And why?  To watch over a religious tour to a holy site in a Palestinian town.  We estimated there were eight Israeli soldiers for every one of those tourists.<\/p>  <p>  I recall standing on a side street in Hebron under a caged roof that was burned through in places by acid thrown down from the settlement.  I remember standing there and counting seven snipers who were aimed at me and my cousin, who worked for a NGO in Palestine.  The tension, fear and intimidation is something I will never forget.<\/p>  <p>  The difference between those Israeli soldiers and soldiers I have come across elsewhere in the world is that I knew instinctively they were not there to protect me or the people around me.<\/p> <p>They were there to protect a certain faction of society and to hell with who got caught in the crossfire.  It is easy to get caught up in the legalities, the legislation and the big news stories about what is going on right now, but this is what is happening in Palestine and, in fact, it is a million times worse in Gaza.  People are living in fear and hopelessness and that is absolutely wrong.<\/p> <p> There are no simple answers.  If there were, they would have been found by now.  However, that does mean we can give up.  We must continue to use our position to find a path to a peace process and a credible solution.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been very clear that much of what is happening in the occupied Palestinian territories is against international law.  Expanding settlements is illegal.  Demolishing the homes of Bedouins is illegal.  Forced evictions in East Jerusalem are illegal.  All of these actions have contributed to rising tensions in an already tense region.  It is up to us and countries like us to stand up for the people who are caught in the crossfire.  We must use our platform on the UN Security Council to find a path to lasting peace and put an end to people dying needlessly every day, children dying because of a war that has been going on since before they were born, families being torn apart and communities being destroyed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000035#LL00400","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Over the past week, the Irish people have shown both their generosity of spirit and their care for global human rights in their response to the human rights violations against the Palestinian people.  Due to our colonial history, we have a strong affinity with the Palestinians and the Government must honour that connection.  First, it is important to look at recent events not in isolation but as examples of how Palestinians are treated on a daily basis.  The current escalation began when the Israeli authorities attempted a forced removal of Palestinians from their homes in neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem.  This attempted eviction is still ongoing.  It is important to remember that the families at risk of eviction are descendants of those who were made refugees when the state of Israel was created in 1948.  They will more than likely be made refugees again.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.  In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the Israeli authorities demolished, forced people to demolish or seized at least 292 Palestinian-owned structures across the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, thereby displacing 450 people, including 246 children.  According to the UN, this constitutes a 121% increase in the targeting of structures and a 126% increase in the number of people displaced, compared with the same period in 2020.  As of 2019, the estimated that Israel had razed 49,532 Palestinian structures.<\/p><p>These demolitions are further compounded by the increase in Israeli settlements, which have ramped up over the past number of years.  Between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, there are now nearly 600,000 settlers.  Settlements are strongly linked to the demolitions that have occurred, as each house demolition takes place strategically, with the aim of making way for more settlers.  The largest settlement has 80,000 people in it, which is exactly the same population as Galway city.  A settler who arrives in the West Bank or East Jerusalem from any place around the globe has more rights than a Palestinian who was born and bred there.<\/p><p>We all know the result of Israel's bombing of Gaza.  At least 65 children are dead, media buildings have been destroyed, one of Gaza's few neurologists was murdered and whole families have vanished.  Are we really meant to believe Israel when it says it is only targeting terrorists?  No one here supports the firing of rockets into civilian areas in Israel but the truth is the truth and the wider context matters very much.  For a prolonged period, we have witnessed a sustained attack on the right of Palestinians to exist.  A Palestinian life seems to be worth less than that of most others around the globe.<\/p><p>The people of this country are demanding action.  We have two options before us.  First, the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 represents a real step that we can take.  It would ban exports from arriving into this country from illegal settlements and would apply to any occupied territory in the world.  The second option is full recognition of the Palestinian state.  That is something for which previous Governments have expressed support and we should not be waiting for permission to do it.\u00a0 It is easy to dismiss either of these measures as token gestures but the occupied territories Bill received global coverage for its potential to act as a model for other nations.  The brutality of Israel's actions in Gaza has rallied global solidarity like never before.  Even in the USA, many Democratic Party politicians have found their voice.  We have a decision to make.  Do we want to be on the right side of history and be the leader we can be, or do we want to play it safe?\u00a0 Israel should have a right to safety, but so should Palestinians.  I hope we can play our part in ensuring that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Cronin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I understood I was sharing time with Deputy McAuliffe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00400","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1621516800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>There is no time left in that slot, according to my list.

They are a dignified change from those of his predecessor during the assault on Gaza in 2014.  Strong words are necessary from Ireland, a country that was occupied and knows the cosh of the coloniser.  This week, Gaza is awash with anguish.  There are reports that 60% of electricity lines are down.  Water pipes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing and tens of thousands of people have no access to clean drinking water.  A M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res clinic has been destroyed, Red Crescent operations are severely disrupted and a Covid testing laboratory was wiped out.  Some 48,000 people are crammed into schools, which the UN hopes will be protected this time by the blue flags flying overhead.  That is not always the case.<\/p>  <p>  There are reports of families sleeping together in one room so that, if they are bombed, they will die together.  In the rubble of their home, a brother and sister found their pet goldfish.  In the rubble of his home, Riyad Eshkuntana was not so lucky.  His wife and four of his children were killed.  Only his daughter Suzy was pulled alive from the wreckage of their home, now the wreckage of their lives.  Suzy is six years old.  Her younger brother Yehya was four.  Yet Israel tells the world it is targeting armed terrorists.  As I wrote this speech, I had to keep updating the number for the deaths of children.  In Israel, there were two.  In Gaza, 40 became 50, 50 became 60 and we are now at 65.  Eleven of those children were receiving trauma counselling when they were killed.  Yet Israel claims it is the victim as the normal service of evicting, settling, displacing, degrading, threatening, annexing, arresting, shooting and beating turns with depressing regularity to bombing.  In this perverse logic, condemning the razing of Palestine and its people is deemed anti-Semitic.  It is not.  Nor is condemning the Israeli Government for its excessive force and its murder of children.  Likewise, the descendants of Holocaust survivors protesting Israel's violence against the Palestinians is not anti-Semitic.<\/p>  <p>  The Kildare bard, Christy Moore, sang: \"[They] tell us who suffer the tear gas and the torture that we're in the wrong.\"  The Palestinian people are in the wrong in shelters, on the beach, in schools, in trauma counselling and in what they hoped, like Riyad Eshkuntana, were safe spaces.  They are in the wrong in childhood.  I say to the terrified people of Gaza today that as a country that knows occupation, Ireland is with them in heart, soul and spirit.  Four years ago, on the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War and the capture of Palestinian lands, the Israeli conductor and peacemaker, Daniel Barenboim, warned Israel that its occupation had \"eroded all sense of decency and humanity and morality from people like me, who had been persecuted for over 20 centuries\".<\/p>  <p>The tide is turning and the world is watching.  The Minister should tell his partners on the UN Security Council, that, as was said by my leader Deputy McDonald earlier, we see them.  We see them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000036#MM00800","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621517400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>In an ideal world there would always be time for diplomacy, a time to temper our language and talk of peace.  However, when children are being bombed in their homes and in their beds, there should be a time to tell the truth.  The truth is that what is happening in Gaza at the minute is a massacre.  Diplomacy is failing when children are bombed in their homes.  Now is the time for plain speaking, to not equivocate in our condemnation, to not equivocate in our language and to not create a false impression of \"both sides-ism\".  Now is the time to call this for what it is.  This situation, the Israeli annexation of Palestinian lands, is an annexation.  There are evictions, there is the bulldozing of homes and there is displacement on a massive scale: it is an annexation.  Now is the time to call out the apartheid and the persecution of the Palestinian people on their own lands for just that: a form of apartheid and a persecution of the Palestinian people.  The international organisation Human Rights Watch took that decision over the last number of weeks.  It has the full support of many within the international community and the Government would do well to follow suit.<\/p>  <p>  Now is the time to call the leaders and the perpetrators of this massacre, this annexation, what they are: warlords.  In particular, the Israeli Minister for Defence campaigned in 2019 on his warlord credentials, and on what he carried out on the people of Gaza in 2014.  This is an old tactic of people who create the idea of an enemy at the gates and present themselves as the only one who can fend them off.  They dehumanise, they create an impression of being constantly under attack and then they present themselves as being the only ones who can save the populace.  The massacre happening in Gaza as we speak will be used to prop up these warlords in elections to come.<\/p>  <p>  When we hear talk of terrorism, we should remember that terrorism has many forms.  Terrorism, as we know it in the post-9\/11 world, comes from terrorists in caves and terrorists firing rockets but terrorism has another form too.  I speak of state-sponsored terrorism, state-aided terrorism and state-enacted terrorism.  We hear of, and I mentioned, children being bombed in their beds in Gaza as if these children were asleep.  These children could not have been asleep, they would simply have been too terrified.  As Deputy Cronin mentioned, 11 of the 65 children killed were undergoing trauma counselling.  That is a form of state-enacted terrorism against children and we should call it what it is.<\/p>  <p>  When we speak of the truth we should also talk about how we act.  The Government has a responsibility to take action and the people demand we take action.  We have a number of options open to us in that regard.  There is a mandate in this Chamber for the passing of the occupied territories Bill.  The Irish people have a proud tradition of boycotts.  Boycott was a weapon of the weak used against the strong throughout our traditions and it is something we can enact in this Chamber by means of that Bill, to say no more will we trade in or do business with the Israeli occupation and annexation of Palestinian lands.  There is legal argument and dispute but I argue strongly in favour of having those legal arguments out on Committee Stage.  Let us bring it through.  Everybody in this Chamber is acting with good intentions, be they in the Government or the Opposition, but there is a bulwark in the form of one particular party and one particular Minister against bringing the occupied territories Bill to the floor of this Chamber and letting it be debated.  Now is the time to act.  We cannot be equivocating in our language; we cannot be equivocating in our actions.  Our diplomacy is failing.  Now is the time to recognise the Palestinian state.  Now is the time to recognise we all have a responsibility to be brave.  We can take actions in this Chamber that will have ramifications around the world.  We did it by not handling goods from apartheid-era South Africa and we can do it again.  To not do so would be the utmost form of cowardice.

I want to step back and look at the root causes of the onslaught we are witnessing on television.  As another Deputy said already, the spark that ignited the current flame was the attempt by the Israeli Government to confiscate homes and to expel Palestinians living in occupied East Jerusalem.  This was an action of annexation.  It was a deliberate action inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in East Jerusalem.  This is what we have been witnessing and what has been going on, not just in East Jerusalem but across the West Bank.  We are dealing with an occupation and a de facto annexation, and we need to start calling it that.  When the Minister was here taking a Topical Issue debate the other day, he spoke about Irish diplomacy preventing the annexation of the Jordan Valley.  That may be a <i>de jure<\/i>annexation but we are witnessing a de facto annexation in East Jerusalem and across the West Bank, and it was the spark that caused the current flame.  That annexation is rooted in the illegal occupation that has been going on since 1967.  That occupation has lead to the annexation but also to all the other things we have heard about today, including the brutality of the occupying soldiers as witnessed by Israeli NGOs like Breaking the Silence, the demolitions, the dispossessions, the checkpoints, the ID cards, the restriction on movement, the restriction on access to education, the violence and the brutality that is upholding this occupation.  That is the root cause - occupation and annexation - and that is what we must tackle.  As I have said, when one looks at Israeli Government policies, they appear to be deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in large parts of the occupied territories.<\/p><p>I also want to take as step forward because we are, one hopes, going to have a ceasefire.  The rockets will stop firing, the bombs will stop dropping and then what do we do?  In 2014 the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, GRM, was set up to help to rebuild Gaza.  The name GRM is Orwellian.  The Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism essentially stops the reconstruction of Gaza and prevents humanitarian aid coming in.  All it did was increase the stranglehold of occupation and control over the Gaza Strip.  We are now in a position at the UN Security Council to be engaging in that next round.  The GRM was a tripartite agreement between Israel, Palestine and the UN.  We must ensure that if there is another GRM, it should work this time.  Ultimately, we should be ending the occupation because that is the only way we are going to reconstruct Gaza but in the meantime, before that, we must ensure the GRM works.  We must support the International Criminal Court, ICC, to ensure any war crimes committed now actually end up there and do not happen with impunity.  We must ensure that if there is going to be another Goldstone report, it should be funded and supported properly.  All these things are essential but in the long term, the only thing we can really do to end this is to recognise the annexation, call it out and work to end the occupation.  All of the things other Deputies have spoken about, including recognition, the occupied territories Bill and recognition of de facto annexation are the things we should be doing to achieve that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000037#NN00300","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1621518000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The death toll in the region has surpassed 200 as we look on in horror at the terrible violence unfolding in the Middle East.

The killing of innocent civilians and children by Israelis is truly appalling and Israeli air strikes in the heart of Gaza killed at least 26 people and destroyed three buildings at the weekend in one of the deadliest attacks since fighting broke out.  Ten women and eight children were among those killed in Sunday's attack, with another 50 injured.  An Israeli air strike destroyed the offices of the Associated Press and other media outlets.  This was an attack on the press itself and the proverbial two fingers to a free press that seeks to expose the horrors unfolding in the region.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has given us the latest death tallies for the Palestinian people.

The current violence is not taking place in a vacuum and it is the product of 54 years of Israeli colonisation of Palestinian lands.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1967, 250 illegal Israeli settlements have been erected, with well over 650,000 illegal settlers.  This is based on an Israeli strategy of remove, fragment and replace, which is designed to allow Israeli settlers to maximise the amount of Palestinian land for themselves.  This is apartheid in practice.  In 2020, 848 Palestinian homes were destroyed, affecting 6,380 Palestinians, including 534 children.  Up to 30 April this year, 316 buildings were destroyed, representing an increase of 108% on the rate for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The human cost of this is catastrophic.  Thousands have been left homeless and very often following the destruction of schools, young children are forced to travel 15 miles to other schools, during which they will often have to pass settlements where they can be subject to abuse.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in call for the implementation of UN resolutions and the enforcement of international law.  We call on the Government to exert its power, influence and moral authority to help bring an end to annexation and use its position on the UN Security Council to full effect to create the moral impetus required for the international community to act.  We also call on the Government to formally recognise the state of Palestine on the basis of the 1967 borders, with east Jerusalem as its capital, and give its support to the occupied territories legislation.  We further call on the Government to expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland for crimes against the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000038#OO00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1621518000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Ten days of terror have been raining down on the people of Gaza.

It was support for the Israeli regime and its actions.  It took nine days of this horror for US President Biden to even call for a ceasefire, and when he did so, he made sure to reiterate what he described as his &quot;firm support&quot; for Israel's right to defend itself.  How do we translate Israel's &quot;right to defend itself&quot; in this discourse?  This equates to the right to continue to murder Palestinians.<\/p><p>Of course, Israel should immediately cease fire but the truth is there will be no long-lasting peace unless there is justice and an end to the occupation of Palestine.  It will not happen unless there is a kicking out of the forces of imperialism and capitalism, which have brought nothing but division, racism and exploitation to the Middle East.  On the basis of ordinary working-class people being in power, this could ensure a just solution, including the rights to a homeland of the Palestinian people as well as the Israeli Jewish people.<\/p><p>Something positive in the horror that has unfolded, which has given a glimpse of how a force exists to bring about that sort of just solution, is what we have seen with Palestinians, no matter where they are located, rising up together.  It is happening in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, within the borders of Israel, in Gaza and in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  We saw the impact of the general strike of Palestinians yesterday shutting down construction in large parts of Israel.  With this we get a glimpse of the potential power and the outlines of a new third <i>intifada<\/i>, which if based on the methods of the first intifada of mass struggle and democratic control from below holds the key to ending the occupation.<\/p><p>Within the horror of widespread racism in Israeli Jewish society there are small but significant indications of rejection.

The response of Israel to peaceful protests across the West Bank and in East Jerusalem has been confrontational.  It is unacceptable.  The air strikes by Israel on Gaza are brutal and disproportionate.  Many innocent civilians, including children, have been killed.  The air strikes by Israeli defence forces on Gaza and the rocket attacks by Hamas from Gaza on Israel have to stop.  There is an urgent need for a ceasefire.  The international community must intervene.  Ireland must continue its efforts to restore peace in the short term and bring about a long-term political settlement in the region through the UN Security Council, the EU Foreign Affairs Council and the Council of the European Union.  So far, the United Nations Security Council has failed in this regard and we know the reasons for that.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, there is a long history to these hostilities.  Israel began to implement its plan to occupy and resettle Palestinian territory decades ago, which resulted in oppression and injustice being visited on the Palestinian people ever since.  This activity is relentless, and especially now in the West bank and East Jerusalem.  It involves home demolitions and forced displacement and transfers.  The appropriation of Palestinian homes, lands and properties continues.  This expansion of Israeli settlements and the creeping process of annexation has to stop.  These actions are fundamentally breaching Palestinians' human rights and are, in so many ways, a breach of international humanitarian law.  Palestinians are being denied equal rights and are being discriminated against in areas effectively under Israeli control.  By any objective standard, this can be called apartheid and should be treated as such by the international community.  A long-term political solution is needed to resolve this ongoing cycle of violence.  Strong commitments are given in the programme for Government on this issue, which refers to the need for a two-state solution, to recognising the state of Palestine, opposing the annexation of territory in the West Bank and opposing the maintenance and expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.  All of this has to happen.  Israel must be persuaded to the existence of a Palestinian state.<\/p>  <p>  The occupied territories Bill did not make the programme for Government, and there are political reasons for that.  In any event, the Attorney General has stated that it is incompatible with EU law.  Next month, however, the European Commission will publish a legislative proposal on mandatory EU-wide human rights and environmental due diligence.  I believe this is very relevant to the situation in the occupied territories in the Middle East.  I hope that this proposal can be agreed and implemented as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that this debate is taking place in Government time but the D&aacute;il must pass an all-party motion dealing with these issues.  The all-party motion would call on the Government to take all measures within its power to make sure Israel is held accountable for its annexation of Palestinian territory, that it halts all settlement activity and that it ensures equal rights and an end to discrimination to all people who are, effectively, under its control.  This would send out a powerful message and I hope we can all agree on this.

Gaza is 41 km long and 10 km wide, with 2 million people locked into it.  Can one imagine if 2 million people were locked into that block of land in Ireland?  The blockade by Israel goes back to 2007.  It is in breach and in contravention of international humanitarian law.  In ten days of the recent bombardment of Gaza, 184 residential towers, 34 media centres, and 1,335 housing units have been destroyed, some 13,000 housing units were partially damaged, 230 people are dead, 65 of whom are children, and more than 1,700 people are wounded.  Innocent bystanders such as a man who was disabled, his pregnant wife and their three-year-old daughter all died in recent bombings in Gaza.  Currently, more than 80% of the 2 million people in Gaza are dependent on international humanitarian aid.<\/p>  <p>  I visited Gaza in 2009 after the bombardment by Israel between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009.  In that bombardment, 1,440 people were killed, of whom more than 330 were children.  Is the same target now being set by the Israeli Government in the current bombardment?  We do not have answers to the question of when this atrocity is going to stop.  When will the continuous bombing of the area stop?  Cluster munitions were used in the 2008 and 2009 bombardment, which are what we would call \"nail bombs\" in Northern Ireland.  White phosphorus was also used, which burns not only the skin but also right into the bone.  No-one is held accountable.  That was in 2009.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting how the US has now vetoed the UN Security Council.  We see too the latest arms deal of more than &euro;700 million.  It is interesting that a motion is now going before the US Congress looking for that to be stalled.  More than $3.8 billion is given by the US to Israel every year.  This is where we should apply the pressure, for the US to stop giving the support so that we can stop the atrocities that are currently occurring in this region.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Gaza 12 years ago.  Are we going to have the same debate in another 12 years, with no change?  Will it be 20 years when we have the same debate with no change?

The UN said this could amount to war crimes.  I say this is a war crime.  The international community and the Irish Government have a duty to step in to help end this crisis and defend the rights of the Palestinian people.  How can the Government do this?  It can start by recognising the state of Palestine.  This would send a really strong message of solidarity and is the correct path to move forward.  Successive Governments have continually dragged their heels on recognising the Palestinian state.  The continued and worn out mantra that the time is not right is just an insult.

I welcome the additional humanitarian aid the Minister announced this afternoon and the extra &euro;1 million for UNRWA and the additional &euro;500,000 for UNICEF on top of what had already been pledged.<\/p>  <p>  I have spent long enough in the Middle East, and that region in particular, to know there are no angels on either side from a combatant point of view.  It is clear from the casualty roll that the Israeli defence forces are operating in an indiscriminate, disproportionate and unacceptable manner.  While all nations are entitled to self-defence this strays way beyond self-defence, particularly so because the iron dome missile interceptor system gives the Israeli defence forces a distinct and decisive advantage.  A central tenet and principle of international humanitarian law is that the side with the greatest power bears the greatest responsibility when it comes to civilian casualties.  There is a lot of extra work the Israeli defence forces needs to do from this point of view.<\/p>  <p>  Uttering these things in an Irish Parliament outside of Israel does not make anybody anti-Semitic.  If anything, this Parliament is pro-Semitic.  It is pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian, pro-Palestine and pro-peace.  We are good friends with the people in the Middle East.  Good friends should be able to speak frankly and honestly with each other and tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear.  I echo the call of the Minister for a ceasefire and guaranteed humanitarian access to Gaza.  I urge the Minister to continue his diplomatic shuttle diplomacy between various capitals to try to seek a resolution.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise getting a ceasefire will not be easy and that diplomacy is not easy either.  As Victor Hugo once said, not being heard is no reason for silence, so keep up the work from this perspective.  Getting a ceasefire from midnight tonight or midnight tomorrow night will not be easy.  Perhaps we should consider a more interim phased approach before we get to a complete truce to allow the opportunity for a political process to kick in.  Perhaps the Minister might wish to consider getting one side in particular, and we all know what side that is, to make a unilateral declaration of proportionality at least, and make a unilateral declaration that it will look after civilians to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  To the Israeli Embassy, which I have no doubt is listening to this exchange and debate, I ask that it convey the sentiment of the Irish Parliament, which is at least a consensus sentiment and perhaps a unanimous sentiment, back to the Prime Minister.

In the past 11 days, we have seen untold suffering being inflicted, predominantly on the people of the Gaza Strip.  We need to recognise the violence that breaks out in the Middle East seems to follow a standard pattern.  Sometimes rockets are fired by Hamas into Israel and inevitably we get a response from the Israeli military and Government that is always disproportionate, excessive and indiscriminate.  We see this by looking at the numbers of casualties in the region over the past 11 days.  To date, it appears 230 Palestinians have been killed in this violence.  Of them, 65 are children.  We also note that ten Israelis have died.  None of these lives should have been lost.  None of these people should have died.  The comparison between the number of Palestinians killed and the number of Israelis killed indicates the indiscriminate and excessive level of violence being perpetrated on the Palestinians by the Israeli Government.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, none of these deaths should have occurred and they could have been avoided if there was recognition that what is required in the Middle East is a political resolution.  We have seen in our own country the pointlessness of violence for the purpose of trying to achieve one's political gains.  It simply does not work.  We have also seen in our country the benefit of negotiation and political leadership to resolve political disputes that appear intractable.  Unfortunately, when it comes to political resolution a huge obligation rests on the more powerful party.  In this instance, the more powerful party is Israel.  Regrettably, we have not seen brave political leadership in Israel since the days of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres back in 1994.  We should recall that peace can be achieved in the Middle East because these two men, along with Yasser Arafat, won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on the Oslo Accords in 1994.<\/p>  <p>  What has happened in Israel, and perhaps in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, is that hardliners have assumed too much power.<\/p> <p>We need to recognise that this violence will continue excessively until such time as there is a political resolution.<\/p> <p> It is extraordinary that there is such unanimity coming from this Chamber.

We have a strong voice.  We are on the Security Council.  We need to use our voice to ensure the United Nations and, more specifically, the United States respond more appropriately to the ongoing inappropriate use of violence by Israel.

I listened careful to what my colleague, Deputy Haughey, said in respect of that.  We should use that opportunity next week in terms of what the European Commission is doing to ensure there is a unified response from the European Union to the ongoing actions in the Middle East.<\/p> <p> We also need to recognise that what is going on is, in effect, the plantation of settlements for the purpose of the annexation of Palestine.

Of Ireland, he said that &quot;though it is a tiny nation, it is a ... moral giant in today's world of fake news, doublespeak and injustice&quot; and he begged us to use that voice to speak out and to rethink our policy on Palestinian-Israeli conflict by upgrading at the very least the status of our office in Ramallah to an embassy.  I say that in the context of the programme for Government which commits to recognising the state of Palestine in due course when it furthers peace but, significantly, before that, to protect the integrity of Palestinian territory.  If this is not a time to stand up and protect the integrity of Palestine, I do not know when that time will come.<\/p><p>The Minister has given figures today.  They are actually out of date.

He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tMr. President,<br \/><br \/>There are no words that can describe the horrors our people are enduring. ...<br \/><br \/>When you embrace your children and grandchildren tonight, think of our children and of how you can honour those killed and [that important little part of the sentence] spare those still alive.  ... each time Israel hears a foreign leader speak of its right to defend itself, it is further emboldened to continue murdering entire families in their sleep.<br \/><br \/>Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, one family at a time.  Israel is trying to uproot Palestinians from Jerusalem, expelling families, one home, one neighbourhood at a time.  Israel is persecuting our people, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.  [It] is unapologetic ...  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am absolutely supportive of Palestine.  I am absolutely supportive of Israel in its right to live peacefully as well.I absolutely condemn the violence of Hamas, but the violence by Israel is out of all proportion.

The power of social media is bringing us their stories and the stark realities of their lives.<\/p> <p> I unequivocally condemn the state of Israel&rsquo;s apartheid aggression and the US and EU that turn their eyes away from this genocide.  The inappropriate responses from President Biden and President von der Leyen and others about both sides and the comments that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas rockets while completely ignoring the rising number of children&rsquo;s deaths is the worst of international politics.  It is not anti-Semitic to speak out against the murder of innocent children, to boycott goods from occupied territories or to call out genocide.  <\/p> <p> Once again, the Tortoise Shack podcast has brought us harrowing on-the-ground news.  A recent recording included a short podcast with Gaza-based journalist Hana Salah when loud explosions could be heard very close to her location.  The short episode ended with her saying that she had to leave the building and get to safety.<\/p> <p> The Twitter feed of the Israel defence forces is just bizarre.  They are tweeting in English and have 1.4 million followers.  The Twitter feed of the state of Israel has been tweeting rocket emojis.  That is the state of its defence.  A thread of tweets was full of rocket emojis.<\/p> <p> On 9 December last, I moved the motion that restored Senator Frances Black&rsquo;s Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill to the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il for this term after others had refused to do so.  It is time to urgently progress this Bill, which is constitutional despite the advice of the Attorney General.  The Government should move it forward right away.<\/p> <p> Ireland should also expel the Israeli ambassador.  The Ceann Comhairle will remember when we expelled a Russian diplomat in a show of solidarity with the UK in 2018.  The Ceann Comhairle should immediately disband the Ireland-Israel parliamentary friendship committee.  It is something we as Members of this House can do right away.  It is completely fair for Members of the House to say that we do not extend friendship to those who kill innocent children and civilians.  Let us show Palestine that Ireland stands in full solidarity by doing the things we can do now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000041#RR00600","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621520400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I want to add my voice to the unanimity of the House in pleading with the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to act.  We had great respect all over the world as a neutral and peaceful country.  We now seem to be beholden to greater powers in Europe and the United States.  We need to send an unequivocal message to the world, and especially Israel, that we will not stand idly by, to use a 1969 phrase from a former Taoiseach.  It is probably the wrong phrase to use.  I refer to the genocide, the murder and slaughter of innocent children and the demolition of houses.  We have talked about homes in Ireland and how hard it is to create a home.  Homes are being knocked down by rockets and bombardments in front of our eyes.  Families are being wiped out.<\/p>  <p>  There is a genocide and a plantation going on in Gaza.  It is happening incrementally.  We have the numbers.  We have seen the might of Israel.  I do not condone Hamas throwing rockets into Israel.  It is being provocative.  Quite simply, it is like a lion against a mouse.  The response is shattering.  Israel can flex its muscles.  The arms industry and the amount invested in armaments are frightening.  It was interesting to listen to Deputy Berry's contribution because he knows the area from his Army experience.<\/p>  <p>  We have to send a message out.  I support Deputy Pringle's call to put forward Senator Black's Bill.  We regularly hear excuses involving the Attorney General.  I have no disrespect for him, but it is one view of a legal situation.  Deputy O'Callaghan made a contribution to this debate.  One could get another view from another senior counsel as to legality.  We need to be independent and to have the best and fairest examination possible of Senator Black's Bill.  We need to do something.  Standing idly by is not an option for the Government and the Irish people. <\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Government to challenge the President of the European Commission to do more and push for more.  We want a ceasefire and we want peace.  That is not easily achieved.  We could look at our own situation in the North and what we got in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  It was a remarkable feat involving a number of former taoisigh, Fr. Alec Reid, Dr. Martin Mansergh and many others.  Where there is a will there is a way.<\/p>  <p>  The tweets being sent by Israel are teasing the rest of the world.  We have to send a clear message that we do not support or condone it.  I agree that we must re-examine the Ireland-Israel friendship group.  We have no truck for it at the moment.  That would be a first step.  It would be a p&iacute;osa beag.  It would tell Israel that we do not appreciate its actions.  It might not respect us, but a lot of countries around the world had, and continue to have, great respect for us and our diaspora.<\/p>  <p>  We need to act, and we must act now to stop the slaughter.  Imagine what it would be like going home tonight to my family, including eight grandchildren, and having three generations wiped out by one rocket launch or bomb.  It is so horrific that one cannot conjure up such images and words are not strong enough to condemn it.  On behalf of the six Rural Independent Group Deputies, I call on the Government to act in a forthright and very firm manner, condemn this for what it is and call it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000042#SS00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1621520400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their statements on this issue.  I would like to restate the Government&rsquo;s deep concern at the intensification of violence in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel over the past week.  We are all in agreement that now is the time for de-escalation and we must encourage all efforts to reach a ceasefire.  We cannot ignore the fact that these events are terrifying for Palestinian and Israeli civilians.  The number of child casualties, over a quarter of all fatalities, is particularly shocking.  The protection of all civilians is of paramount importance and, indeed, it is an obligation under international humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  Israel has a right to defend itself.  The deaths of Israeli citizens are unacceptable and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has rightly called on all factions in Gaza to halt indiscriminate attacks on Israel immediately.  However, the impact of Israeli strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip is disproportionate, a fact to which many Deputies alluded.  The impact on children in an already difficult humanitarian situation is especially worrying.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to address some of the points raised regarding these civilian impacts.  As Minister of State at the Department of Education, it is especially shocking to read reports of damage and destruction to schools and educational facilities.  The UN reports that 45 schools, two kindergartens and a vocational training centre have been damaged in the Gaza Strip since the start of the escalation.  Education, as we know, is a lifeline for the 2 million people of Gaza.  It is an opportunity to escape the daily realities of the blockade which has left them forcibly isolated from the rest of the world for over 13 years.<\/p>  <p>  The repeated cycles of violence and bloodshed, as well as living in fear of the next air strike, have a strong effect on the emotional and psychosocial well-being of students, teachers, and their communities.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;500,000 for UNICEF&rsquo;s emergency appeal, which will include emergency psychosocial services for 5,000 children suffering trauma as a result of the hostilities.<\/p>  <p>  The damage to hospitals and the knock-on impact on the provision of healthcare in the Gaza Strip is deeply worrying.  Six hospitals and 11 primary healthcare centres have been damaged, with one centre suffering severe damage.  In addition, damage to vital infrastructure and insufficient fuel supplies have affected water, sanitation and hygiene services for hundreds of thousands of people.  Electrical power shortages hinder healthcare provision throughout Gaza and one hospital is not functioning due to the lack of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  The latest hostilities have displaced over 58,000 Palestinians, many of whom are seeking refuge in UNRWA schools across Gaza.  There is, of course, the added concern at this time around the transmission of Covid-19 between vulnerable people huddled in crowded shelters and the inability of the healthcare system to cope.<\/p> <p>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs referenced in his statement, this is why we have announced funding of &euro;1.5 million to enable UN agencies carry out vital work in support of these vulnerable civilians.  <\/p> <p> While the focus today is rightly on the intensification of violence, we cannot, and must not, shy away from the fact that the overall human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories remains a matter of serious concern.  The protection and promotion of human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels.  <\/p> <p> Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard.  Ireland is a consistent and strong contributor in interactive dialogues with the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories at the council and, indeed, at the UN General Assembly.  At the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in March, Ireland made a statement under No. 7 during the general debate, which restated our commitment to principles of accountability and emphasised that Ireland will continue to speak out against unilateral actions that are in breach of international humanitarian law.  We regularly convey our concerns on human rights issues to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs raised these concerns with the Israeli ambassador last week.  We also provide financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs working on human rights issues.<\/p> <p> The events of the past week have not happened in isolation.  They come after settlement expansion, threats of evictions and violence against Palestinians.  Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution based on international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies raised a few issues, one of which was the occupied territories Bill.  As previously stated, the Bill would not be compatible with EU law and would not be implementable.  The Government will not, therefore, take it forward.  We acknowledge that support for the Bill is a sign of very deep concern about settlements.  Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements and will continue to so.  The Government's position on settlements is that we are absolutely opposed to them.  <\/p> <p> With respect to calls to expel the Israeli ambassador, Ireland's bilateral relationship with Israel is important as it is a means for us to directly communicate our concerns about actions such as those we witnessed in the past week.  On 11 May, the Minister called in the Israeli ambassador and underlined that Israel's actions in Gaza, which are causing significant civilian casualties, are unacceptable and Israel must act responsibly and comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.  These messages matter.  By expelling an ambassador, we would close down our channel of communication with the Israeli Government.  <\/p> <p> Furthermore, some Deputies asked whether Ireland will recognise Palestine.  As some Deputies pointed out, the programme for Government states that the Government will honour its commitment to recognise the state of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or, in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-state solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory.  The Minister has been clear that, in the absence of progress towards a two-state solution, he would be prepared to recommend to Government early recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful.  It is a matter that is also being discussed with EU colleagues.  Recognition by Ireland, outside the context of an overall peace agreement would, however, be likely to affect Ireland's influence on the Israel-Palestine conflict at EU and international level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000042#SS00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nursing Home Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1621521000,"counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621521000,"counter":418,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy was in possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I was in possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It has been some time coming.  Many people are interested in the issue and would have liked to see the Bill being brought forward sooner.  Its provisions will be important for those affected, particularly small family farmers and small business owners.  It will provide them with some solace and protection and will also ensure, in some part, that their businesses and farms are sustainable and viable.  That is a really important point for our rural communities, in particular, and is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  It also speaks to the greater point about models of care and the nursing homes support scheme.  There are very significant challenges.  Those of us interested in the demographics and the nature of our health services know that we have a very particular challenge in Ireland in sustaining nursing home support and care of the elderly.  We all want to see a model that provides for people living at home for as long as possible.  That is an important element.  Nursing homes have an important role to play, but much needs to be done to ensure that older people can live at home for as long as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the role of carers and the need to support them to care for people in their homes, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, brought forward a charter for carers.  A number of important measures would be of significant benefit in terms of practical supports for carers, such as talk therapy and expanding GP visit cards, in addition to increasing and expanding carer's allowance, carer's benefit and support grants.  The introduction of a discretionary grant for carers would be another important measure that would be a significant positive.  I know many who are struggling to pay their heating and electricity bills, such is the nature of their work and, unfortunately, the way in which they are valued by this State.  It is well recognised that carers play a major role in providing care, which is not valued in the way it should be.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The greater point about the role of the nursing homes scheme is that it has developed in a largely uncontrolled way.  I see it in my county of Meath, where there was much speculation, general tax breaks and incentives for people to build nursing homes.  People have ended up in that sector for reasons other than having a traditional background in healthcare provision and delivery.  That, in and of itself, raises the real need for a strong role for HIQA, but also for ensuring maintenance of high standards, which includes the terms and conditions of employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, certainly in its first wave, many of the weaknesses within the system.<\/p> <p>We will have an opportunity to address that.  Many people working in the sector are dedicated and tremendously hard-working.  It would be to everybody's benefit to put in place robust standards and protections for staff, workers and the residents themselves.  That will be important going forward as the growing ageing population puts pressure on those services.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and there will be further opportunities to develop it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000043#TT00700","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621521600,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy O'Rourke.  We are glad to see this legislation.  The nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme, needs significant tweaking.  More widely, we need not only to support people in nursing homes but ensure we are not impacting on the sustainability of small businesses and small family farms.  That is something that has to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic period has made us look at how we deal with elder care.  There have been a number of reports in the last while, including those from the expert panel and HIQA, which stated that nursing homes should not be the only option for older people in need of enhanced care.  We are going to need an entire package.  We all know that home care packages can be lacking and that has been mentioned in this House from time to time.  Multidisciplinary supports are required to facilitate people in later life.  Our demographics are going to change and we will have a greater number of older people.  They should be able to stay living within their own homes, which is possibly better for them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Both HIQA and the expert panel agreed that we need reform of nursing home care.  We need to look at the way we do it, how we audit systems and the way we situate, organise and construct buildings.  We have to look at public versus private provision.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, some of our system was not necessarily designed but was the result of unintended consequences from tax breaks.  Money went in a particular direction and we ended up in the situation we are now in.  A number of nursing homes operated as separate businesses and outside the wider controls of the State or did not have the relationship with the HSE and the healthcare system that we would have wanted.  That led to difficulties, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic.  That is why a major part of the report of the Covid committee was on the requirement for an inquiry into how we dealt with that period.  There needs to be significant emphasis within this House on ensuring draft terms of reference are provided because they are required and we are behind time.  That was meant to have been done already.  There have been discussions and Government sources have said in the papers that we are moving towards an overall inquiry into elder care, and particularly into how it was dealt with at the beginning of this pandemic.  That is absolutely required.  We also need a committee to look at the guidance that has been given to us by these reports on how to deal holistically with elder care and produce a system that will deliver for all of us, especially our older people.<\/p>  <p>  We all remember the significant tragedies that occurred in nursing homes a year ago and we had a repeat of that in January.  A number of families who have gone through deep trauma and hurt are looking for answers.  They will require these inquiries.  I have spoken previously to both the Minister for Health and the Minister of State about the terrible tragedy that occurred in Dealgan House, with the loss of 22 residents.  That had a significant impact on their families and I commend them for the considerable work they have done in looking for answers.  The Minister and Minister of State have met with them and there have been discussions about creating a mechanism to provide them with answers.  As much as there needs to be a wider inquiry into the nursing home sector, how we dealt with the pandemic and how we deal with elder care in to the future, we also need a specific public inquiry into what went wrong in Dealgan House and what the lessons are for the future.  Everyone needs that.  The families are also experiencing difficulties in accessing information from the HSE.  I understand that we are in a difficult period due to the recent ransomware attack but this is something I will continue to bring up.  I will have conversations with the Minister and the Minister of State about this matter because we have to provide for these families.  Beyond that, we need to deliver a fit-for-purpose system and scheme for our elderly across the board.  I commend this legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000044#UU00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1621521600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>This Bill has merit as regards the fair deal scheme and family farms and businesses.  I am sure there is great regret in homes across the State that funds that went out cannot be recouped.  The care of their elderly is preoccupying many families at the moment and it never stops, because true as night follows day, we are all getting older.  There is just no way out of that.<\/p>  <p>  While the fair deal aspect of the Bill has merit, I regret that it takes no proper account of the ongoing privatisation and commodification of the nursing home sector, where personal and State money is increasingly going to global wealth funds.  We should be asking questions about this in our Parliament, here in the D&aacute;il, and in public, because it is degrading and diminishing for our older people that their needs as they age are the subject of international profit and speculation.  We learned last week that French healthcare giant Orpea is to become the biggest provider in the nursing home market.  Orpea was reported as having a half-year revenue to June 2019 of &euro;1.9 billion.  That is almost &euro;2 billion revenue in six months alone.  This is serious business news with equally serious social consequences.  We are talking about wealth fund billions for the essential care of our own people, who worked hard, raised their families, bought their homes and paid their taxes all their lives.  I do not see anything in this Bill at this stage addressing how the care of our older people is being increasingly profitised and commodified.  That is everyone&rsquo;s business because if we are lucky, we will all live to be old and the care being speculated on as a market commodity will be our own.<\/p>  <p>  I know I speak for vast numbers of my constituents when I say we would like to age under our own steam and in our own communities wherever possible.  That is why in government, Sinn F&eacute;in will establish a statutory home care scheme, in order that our care is based around our needs, as opposed to our experience of ageing being made to fit the preferred care model.  A model that favours private profit over public service is just not acceptable.  I am not referring to the small, family-run private nursing homes.  I am referring to the huge investors and wealth funds.  We have been talking about these funds coming into our housing market but they are taking over our nursing homes as well.  We have to see elder care as a necessity and a right.  We would rather have supports for community living than the elevation of the nursing home model, and the private nursing home model at that.  However, it is inevitable that some of us will require nursing home care and we favour the public model in that necessary instance.  It can come as quite a shock to people to find out that only 20% of our nursing homes are in public ownership.  Just as with housing and childcare, elder care should never be commodified, because these are not options or luxuries.  These are essentials of living in which we, as citizens of this State, should not be placed at the mercy of profit and the market.<\/p> <p>It should be the same as in housing and childcare and in the care of older persons.  I believe it is fair to say that in the social contract, there is no deal, fair or otherwise, about that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000044#UU00300","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621522200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>With the agreement of the House, I am going back to Deputy Flaherty, who is now in the Chamber.

I pay special tribute to the Minister of State for her work on this Bill.  It is an area she has been extremely passionate about for several years.  She identified the many inequalities in this sector early in her political life and resolved to put them right.  It is fair to say we have a great champion for our older, and often most marginalised, people.  I digress somewhat, but I also take this chance to commend her on her hands-on role in the administration and management of the home vaccine programme.  It was, arguably, one of the most difficult strands of the vaccine programme, but the Minister of State realised that it was one we had to get right.  Working with the National Ambulance Service, she made it her personal mission.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to thank the staff who have worked in our nursing homes and care facilities throughout what has arguably been the most difficult 14 months of their lives.  I think especially of St. Joseph&rsquo;s care centre and Laurel Lodge nursing home in Longford town, Thomond Lodge nursing home in Ballymahon, Our Lady's Manor nursing home in Edgeworthstown, and Costello's care home and Innis Ree Lodge nursing home in Ballyleague, which, although they might be over the bridge in Connacht, we still regard as part of Longford.  <\/p>  <p>  In all these locations, staff have gone above and beyond the call of duty over the past 14 months, and often in the most trying of circumstances.  It has been a terribly difficult time for the residents of these facilities, while for their family members who have been unable to see and visit them, it has been truly agonising.  Again, however, it was the Minister of State who campaigned week after week for greater access and visitation rights for family members.  As our vaccination programme rolls out with momentum, we are finally nearing a return to normal visiting access for these and many other care facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Rural Ireland has waited a long time for this Bill, as many speakers said.  Every constituency office has tales of despair and disappointment concerning the existing fair deal scheme.  Finally, we have the long-sought scheme to provide greater protections for farm families and family-owned businesses.  I am very proud Fianna Fail&rsquo;s fingerprints are evident on this Bill.  It was a firm commitment from our party, north, south east and west, that we address these inequalities, and thanks to the Minister of State and her team in the Department we are able to stand over that commitment today.  After three years, the value of family-owned farms or businesses will no longer be factored in when calculating the cost of a person&rsquo;s nursing home care.  This will be the case where a family successor intends to continue working the farm or running the business.  It is a necessary change if we want to sustain and protect the family farm and the many related small businesses, all of which, when combined, are the bedrock of rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We are incredibly proud in this House of rural Ireland and the stellar international appeal and reputation which it enjoys.  Rural Ireland looks green, spectacular and incredibly inviting, and that is thanks to the many farm families and small family businesses.  The farm family is not a business, an institution or some legal entity.  It is a family treasure, burnished over generations, and protecting it and its dependents is sacrosanct for any Government.  I am extremely pleased to see that this Bill has almost universal support.  There is a message here and it is a simple one.  When ideological differences and agendas are parked, solutions can and will always be found.  Too often in this House, debates and problems are battled out on ideological  grounds.  Rather than arriving at solutions, we are allowing and, in many cases, forcing issues to fester and deteriorate further as the House loses itself in acrimony and the recycling of past failings and future fears.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State and all the parties listened to the public, to the families affected, to the farm organisations and to the many owners of small family-run businesses and realised that change was needed.  The nursing home support scheme has operated for more than a decade and in a political world that is a lifetime.  We all readily agree that it has been a success and a mechanism through which families have been able to access the care and supports for loved ones which would otherwise have eluded them.  Up to the end of  2020, 22,755 people were participating in the scheme at an annual cost of more than &euro;1 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Participants in the scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The overall aim of the scheme is that participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The capital value of people's principal private residences is only included in the financial assessment for the scheme for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three-year cap.  Currently, this unqualified three-year cap does not apply to productive assets, such as farms and businesses, except in the case where a farmer or business owner suffers a sudden illness or disability and as a result requires nursing home care.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to address this issue by introducing additional safeguards to the scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed on to the next generation of many families.  The proposed change is to cap the financial contributions based on farm and business assets at three years, where a nominated family successor commits to working with the productive asset within the first three years of the resident&rsquo;s time in care.  Sadly, this Government struggles to find favour as we are caught in a maelstrom of public discontent and frustration in the face of Covid-19 and crises in health and housing.  Today is a good day for the Government, however.  It is a great day for the Minister of State and also a great day for our colleagues in Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party who were involved in talks on the formation of a Government.  We can all say that this is one they did get right.  <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that I have a few minutes left, so I have two key questions for the Minister of State to respond to, if she is able to do so.  First, regarding the case of a family member who has been in a nursing home for two and a half years, will that time count towards the three years?  Will only six months remain in that case?  Finally, it is important that the Minister of State and her Department can today give the House commitment regarding the implementation of these changes, because this Bill has been in gestation for a long time, as many speakers have said.  We are beholden to the Irish people, and particularly the many families who have struggled with the fair deal scheme, to give a clear and distinct timeline concerning when this legislation will come into effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000045#VV00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1621522200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill.  I did not get a chance today to count all the parliamentary questions I submitted over the years concerning when this Bill would be introduced.  It was promised and promised, and yet, like many things, it never happened.  The Minister of State is less than a year in government and she has already brought this Bill before the House.  I congratulate her on doing that.  Promises never fed anybody or solved a problem.  Action is what was needed here, and action is what we are getting.<\/p>  <p>  In this State, we need to look holistically at our care of the elderly.  We have not done that for many years.  Many policies impact on care provision.  Covid-19 made one thing very clear in that regard.  It was interesting that a statement made at the height of the pandemic crisis by then Taoiseach, and now the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, remarked that it was not a great policy to put people into nursing homes who, if better arrangements were put in place by the State, communities and society, could have lived independently or with intensive support within the community.<\/p> <p>In looking at this, the issue of physical planning has to be taken into account.  Looking at our rural areas, all of the plans and designs of the great experts in planning seem to be designed to stop people living in the area from which they come and near their parents, particularly in rural Ireland.  I have argued repeatedly that the free choice of people to live in the community from which they come and to live near their parents should be facilitated.  There are two very obvious human consequences from that, which professional planners and academics, in particular, seem to overlook.  The first is that in the earlier years, parents often become grandparents and become a very big support within the family network in terms of babysitting, nurturing, supporting and educating, doing all the things that grandparents can do and can do in a special way.  As the years go by, the grandparents are often looked after and cared for by the next generation.  In those situations it is often possible to continue living in one's own home, which I believe is the wish of most older people.<\/p> <p> Therefore, we should think this out again post Covid.  It does not matter what mistakes we have made in the past.  Just because we may have got it wrong, there is no need to avoid putting our hands up and admitting that is the case.  We can admit that we did not think about a particular element and revise our thoughts on the matter.<\/p> <p> The second option is the provision of dedicated housing for the elderly in small clusters.  There is a perfect example of the provision of such housing in my parish.  It is a community-operated social housing scheme.  It is built around an old convent which is now a day care centre and a health centre.  It is located beside the church, the shops and the post office.  There are eight houses in the development.  In my parish, the vast majority of older people choose to stay in their own homes, but there is a minority for whom that is not a viable option.  They move into these houses where the services are all near-by.  There should be one such scheme in every parish, so that support and meals can be provided easily.  However, meals-on-wheels should be available pervasively throughout the community.<\/p> <p> There are also models which provide even higher levels of support that are not nursing home care.  Therefore, in many cases nursing home care should be the last option.  However, it is one that is absolutely vital and for which there will always be a demand.  Some people choose to go into a nursing home for reasons that are good to themselves.  For others, there is no choice because of the level of disability and the support that they need.  All of these must be facilitated.<\/p> <p> When we look at our model for nursing home care, the one good thing is that I can always reassure people that those of very little means will go into the same nursing home as those of significant means.  They will get the same care and they will only pay according to their ability to pay.  According to the scheme, 80% of the person's income is assessed, and he or she gets to keep 20%.  However, assets are taken into account.  That is the issue that we are addressing.<\/p> <p> Normally, a couple's assets are divided into two in the means test.  In the case of a single person, all the assets are taken into account.  There is a disregard of &euro;36,000 for a single person and &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple.  The house or principal residency is taken into account and 7.5% of that value is included in the assessment each year for three years.  Therefore, the maximum amount that is taken out of the estate by means of a charge is &euro;22,500, because the collection of this money can be deferred.  However, there was a problem with the scheme.  The value of family farms and small businesses could be assessed continuously, with no cap, at a rate of 7.5% per annum.<\/p> <p> The average stay in a nursing home is less than three years, but there are many people in respect of whom it is longer.  I recall the case of a neighbour of mine, who went into a nursing home.  I visited that neighbour two years later.  I did not think that person would survive as long.  It was a great thing that the person did survive for years as a single person who had been living alone in the nursing home.  If that person had a farm or a business, the amount included in the assessment would have increased until virtually the whole farm or business would be taken away.  For many families, a family business or farm is something that they have effectively inherited on trust, which they pass on to the next generation.  They hope to pass it on intact.<\/p> <p> The other rule that catches people out is illustrated by the following example.  If an elderly parent had a son or daughter working on the farm with him or her, unless he or she transferred the farm to the son or daughter five years or more before going into the nursing home, except in exceptional circumstances, the assessment would include the total value of the farm.  So, if he or she transferred it three years before going into the nursing home and did not own the farm on going into the nursing home, he or she would still be assessed as owning the farm.  Of course, that rule has placed a huge burden on people.  I have often pointed to what I refer to as the double lock system in rural Ireland, whereby parents are reluctant to hand over the ownership of their property at times and they will it to their children.  For one reason or another, they keep their name on the deeds of the property as they get older.<\/p> <p> There are many reasons, which I do not need to into, why this might happen.  By introducing the rule whereby if the successor has worked on the farm in three of the previous five years and undertakes to continue to devote a reasonable amount of time to the farm in the following years - I believe it is six years - the value of the property will only be included in the assessment for three and a half years.  This means it will be treated on the same basis as the family home.  What that means is that if the person lives in the nursing home for three years, 22.5% of the asset will have a burden on it that will have to be repaid to the State.  That is a far cry from what can happen if somebody lives, for one reason or another, in a nursing home for ten years.  The inclusion of 7.5% of value of the property in the assessment would amount to 75% of its value.  That does happen in some cases involving various conditions that we can fully understand and that we have all come across.<\/p> <p> There are many other issues, but I will run out of time before I can cover all the issues I would like to cover.  I would like to raise an issue that I think needs addressing.  I refer to the example in which a couple or a single person goes into a nursing home and they have a private principal residence which is empty.<\/p> <p>They are in the nursing home for one, two, three, four years and so forth.  After three years the clock stops, but the house is empty.  However, if at any time one liquidates the asset and ensures that somebody can occupy the house, in other words, one sells the house, one then becomes liable for the cash one received on a continuous basis in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years.  There is no doubt that at a time of huge housing shortage there are houses in this country that are owned by people in nursing homes.  They are either afraid that if they cash out now that after the third year, if the people in the nursing home survive, they will keep having to pay, or where they have already spent the three years in the nursing home, they would certainly be levied indefinitely on the capital they would realise.  Therefore they do not sell and make the house available.  This is a pity because, as I said, housing is in short supply.  We should consider a provision whereby if a vacant house belonging to somebody in a nursing home is sold after the person goes into the nursing home, the proceeds of that sale, whether it happened within the three-year period or afterwards, would be treated as if they were the house.  If we made that change, we could do away with the scandal of vacant houses around the country at a time so many people are screaming out for housing.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the model of private versus public nursing home care.  First, HIQA does a very thorough job.  One of the good decisions was to bring HIQA into the equation.  The authority was set up during the Taoiseach's time as Minister for Health.  It certainly was proposed at that time.  It is very important that such a service exists to monitor, on our behalf, the human and physical standards adhered to in the many health facilities, particularly in the nursing home sector, because ultimately we do not know which service, be it private or public, might leave a little or a lot to be desired in how it operates.<\/p> <p> The argument regarding the private and public sectors is old, and one I do not find easy to resolve.  Public care is very good and there is a number of the facilities in my constituency.  They earn universal praise.  Most of the private nursing homes in my constituency appear to be owner-run.  They, too, provide top-class services.  If we had relied on the public service to provide all the nursing homes we needed with a burgeoning older population, I am not sure that we would have met the demand in time in the way the private sector did.  There were flaws and difficulties with that, but in the greater scheme of things, the private sector delivered in great measure to meet a rapidly increasing demand, brought capital into the process and delivered projects.  As I said, there is a very strict regime in terms of scrutiny by HIQA.  The other issue is that because people have a choice in nursing homes, it is fair to say that there is fairly fast migration away from the nursing homes that are not providing a high standard of care.<\/p> <p> That said, as in so many facets of life, I do not like the corporatisation of businesses by big players.  I would much prefer the small operator dedicated to the task.  I do not know if there is any way to try to incentivise that approach, particularly in line with EU rules that can often be a barrier by favouring one thing rather than another.  I would prefer that because personal attention is very good.  I recall reading a document about the 1940s when the question was asked of Fianna F&aacute;il as to what its policy was on private property.  A very interesting answer was given.  It was that Fianna F&aacute;il was in favour of private property, but, and this was vital, in as diffuse an ownership of private property as possible.  The party was making it quite clear that many people owning a little was a great deal better than the few owning a lot.  Unfortunately, modern trends are going the other way and it appears that small operators of every type in social and commercial services and in so many facets of life are being swallowed up by the might of the euro, and those who have a large number of them.  Whether it is private housing, social care, nursing home care or ordinary private business, I am not sure that this is a good model.  It is not just confined to this sector, and it is something on which we need a wider debate on another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000045#VV00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621523400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this much promised debate.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on steering this through the Department and the Government.  I know the tenacious way she applied herself to the job, to ensure the Bill was brought to the D&aacute;il and, hopefully, through the Seanad and onto the Statute Book as soon as possible.  I wish to ensure that it be done as soon as possible.  It is a very important legislative measure.  No constituency office, rural or urban, unaffected by this or is not having discussions with family members about small businesses and farms, trying to do the right thing for them and trying to ensure the future viability of small businesses and family farms into the next generation.  It has been a discussion for many years between farming organisations, business organisations and the Department.  However, it took the Minister of State to ensure that this came through, and I congratulate her on the way she did it.  She should keep up the good work she is doing in the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Before I discuss the substance of the Bill, I should point out that nursing home care is a massively important part of the care of the elderly in our society.  For decades, community hospitals provided nursing home care.<\/p> <p>It was, by and large, done in the public sector and in community hospitals up to 20 or 25 years ago.  Going back decades, the acute services in those hospitals, of which there may have been some, were withdrawn and they became hospitals providing care for the elderly.  The debate on refurbishment enters at that point.  I am glad to say that the Department of Health and the HSE are moving to advance the refurbishment of Macroom, Kanturk and Millstreet community hospitals.  Those hospitals have provided vital services over the years.  The staff and management of those hospitals must be commended for the excellent way in which they have cared for the people, particularly in the Kanturk and Millstreet hospitals.  They have cared for the people of Duhallow in their most vulnerable time of need.  There is not a family within our communities that has not had a loved one in those hospitals for some time.  Many have spent their final days in either Millstreet or Kanturk hospital.  The workmanship and standard of care provided by the nurses, care assistants and all who are inside those hospitals need to be applauded and they should be thanked for their dedication and work.  Any time that one goes into those hospitals, one can see the commitment of the staff and the compassion they have for those whose care they are charged with.  It is important that we acknowledge and accept that, and applaud it in every way we can.<\/p> <p> Over the past number of years, HIQA has come on board.  HIQA was initiated approximately 20 years ago and it has done various reports into the community hospitals and residential settings and has been critical of the antiquated buildings.  The Department and the HSE have worked at a slow pace to bring those community hospitals up to standard.  It was clearly evident many years ago that these hospitals would not meet the correct standard required today.  The bed numbers were reduced because of HIQA reports.  The capacity was reduced.  While nursing homes would take up the long-term care, many people would require acute hospital and medical care.  Such people were predominantly being cared for in the community hospitals.  It is important that the HSE and the Department of Health come up with the money to ensure that any community hospitals which receive a critical report, stating they are not up to standard, are brought up to standard and their capacity is maintained.  I am glad that the hospitals are working at pace to get the foundations laid and work started.  Tenders, documents and so forth are in place.  It is important that we keep an eye on it and ensure that the work on those hospitals starts.  It is long-awaited and long-promised but it will happen at last.<\/p> <p> An amount of work is being done by the private nursing homes.  In some past instances, families have started nursing homes.  There is regulation in respect of nursing homes nowadays, guidance for care and instruction as to what is needed and expected of someone who starts up a nursing home.  In some of the instances where nursing homes were started, the dedicated people involved understood people's care needs and built nursing homes with little or no help or guidance.  We must applaud them.  They have continued to maintain those nursing homes.  The people who work in those institutions have committed their lives to caring and are dedicated.  <\/p> <p> It would be remiss of me while speaking on this topic not to refer to the recent report of the Ombudsman about young people who require long-term care, whether they have a capacity issue, in terms of disability, or have been the victims of a road traffic accident or any other issue.  Such people are sometimes committed to long-term nursing homes because no other residential setting is available for them.  We as a country need to take that head-on.  It is vital that we ensure it is no longer acceptable that nursing homes or community hospitals are settings for young people with long-term care needs.  Some people in their 30s or 40s, or younger in some instances, with care needs have been left without alternatives.  We as a State need to be mindful of that.  We need to take head-on the report that was published a couple of weeks ago.  We need to try to challenge what is in that report and ensure it is corrected in the shortest possible period of time.<\/p> <p> This Bill is predominantly to ensure a fairer deal for people with small businesses and farms, and to ensure a nursing home set-up is there for them.  I know that the Minister of State has been a champion of keeping people at home and in their own communities as long as possible.  That must be an extremely strong arm of the State.  It must be strong in the context of public health nurses, home help co-ordinators, the people who provide help at home and home care assistants, who were once called \"home help\".  They have been doing invaluable work.  Our family has benefited enormously from the professionalism of the public health nurses and the home care team and we are deeply indebted to what they did for our family when we needed them.  We will be indebted to them for the rest of our lives for the work they did in our setting.  Many other families are in the same position and understand this too.<\/p> <p> We must further empower the sector and ensure that it is stronger, better and more robust.  Some people are looking for extra hours of home help and, depending on a family's circumstance, they may need help in the evening to get an elderly person to bed and so forth.  We need to accommodate the needs of people, including the families and the people who require care.  People will try to manage for as long as they possibly can but when they go looking for help, we need to be more robust in ensuring help is out there.  Much of the time, the challenges relate to getting home help professionals and people to do the work in different parts of the country.  We need to take a fundamental look at the whole home care package to ensure that people are kept in their homes as long as possible.  It is far more beneficial for society, whatever way you look at it, to have people in their homes for as long as is humanly possible.  It benefits everybody, including the patient, the family and the State.  We should be looking at it in a critical way and examining how we can improve the position as we go forward.  Those services have been invaluable to many families but there are gaps that need to be addressed and we need to be mindful of that.  We must be at the forefront in ensuring the continuation of those services.<\/p> <p> I pay the utmost tribute to those who are on the front line and providing those services in people's homes on a daily basis.  They have showed professionalism, particularly over the past 12 months.  They dealt with the situation and stepped up to the plate, showing courage and commitment in everything they did.  I am referring to public health nurses and care assistants, and I say \"well done\" to everybody for what they have done over the past while.<\/p> <p> Some nursing homes have added different services and extra charges.  That is unfair.  A family with somebody in a nursing home are depending on their means and circumstances.  They are paying so much towards nursing home care that we need to be mindful there is not much more that family can give.<\/p> <p>Some people have paid extraordinary fees over the years, in particular, as I said, the family farm units.  They do not have very big farms but because it is on paper, it is valued for a huge amount of money, which causes an awful lot of difficulty.<\/p> <p> As we are debating it, the discussion must acknowledge that our population will grow older over the next number of years.  We have to be mindful that the policies being discussed by the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government, which we should discuss on a regular basis, will impact on society for the next 25 years.<\/p> <p> We must recognise the direction in which the demographics are going and what is coming down the tracks in terms of what we need regarding care.  We also need to make sure we are not just doing it the cost-effective way.  The State is always looking at the cost-effective way and how much it will cost but what is best for the greater good of society?<\/p> <p> The previous speaker, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, spoke about the role of planning.  It might be very far away from this Bill but it is fundamentally right.  If one can ensure the support is intergenerational, then a couple of generations of people who live in close communities will support themselves.  The older families would support the younger families in the first instance and, as time goes by, the younger families would support the older families.  That has always been the case going back over the decades.<\/p> <p> There was this notion that we should urbanise the entire country and have nothing in rural communities.  Covid-19 has  shown without any shadow doubt that this was a wrong policy.  We need to reverse that and recognise the greater good in terms of providing the intergenerational support that was there in decades past.  It can be recreated if we have the mind to challenge some of the rhetoric or policies.<\/p> <p> There is much we could talk about.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State on the way she has brought it forward.  It is important this Bill becomes law as soon as possible.  Will the Minister of State in her closing remarks give us an idea of when she envisages that it will be on the Statute Book?  Will it accommodate people who are going into nursing homes today and tomorrow?  Will it ensure the family farms or small businesses will not be affected if people are going into nursing homes on the last week of May 2021.  The Minister of State might refer to that issue.<\/p> <p> I also pay an enormous tribute to all those who worked on the front line during the last 14 months in community hospitals and nursing homes given the challenges they faced and the suffering and heartache they saw among the elderly people who died as a result of Covid-19.  As a result of that pain and suffering, it will be two or three generations before the heartache those workers saw in the families who lost loved ones to Covid will be erased from memory.  The way they had to part with their loved ones, particularly in the earlier part of the pandemic, will resonate for a long time.<\/p> <p> I thank all those who have put their lives on hold for their professionalism in how they deal with people who are at the end of their days.  It is important we treat the elderly with respect.<\/p> <p> I also want to ensure the Minister of State takes on board the Ombudsman's report on people with intellectual and physical disabilities who are in long-term nursing homes or community hospitals.  It is not a setting for them, certainly not in 21st century Ireland, and it needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p> We must bear planning in mind in every discussion we have with regard to the next generation and the ageing of our population.  We have to bear in mind that a huge swathe of the countryside needs to be repopulated, where people have family support.  That feeds into a whole raft of other issues in terms of housing and everything else.  That is a sc&eacute;al eile.<\/p> <p> The other issue is sheltered houses and the sheltered housing model in terms of people who are moving into towns or villages.  The sheltered housing model that was in place comprised the small community groups, which were set up as section 39 housing organisations, did such great work right throughout the country.  We should be encouraging this more, and encouraging those who have it done it in the past to perhaps add another number of units onto their facility, because they are doing excellent work.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State will be aware, there is a huge appetite for daycare centres, which provided massive services to elderly people in their own homes, and to reopen them as soon as possible.  Sage Advocacy has issued statements over the last few days in that regard and I support what it is doing.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle very much for the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000047#XX00200","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621524600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The Solidarity slot is next but I do not believe anyone from that group is present.

I will go first because I am probably closer to benefitting from the legislation than Deputy Devlin.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on this legislation, although not just this legislation but on her work over the last number of years as Opposition spokesperson on older people in pioneering this legislation and delivering it within ten months of the lifetime of the Government.  I commend her persistence and commitment in a very challenging time to ensuring we will get there.<\/p>  <p>  I have some concerns about the legislation, particularly where a direct successor may not be available to a person or may not be in a position to carry on the business.  The Minister of State is taking those concerns on board, otherwise there would not be the same benefit for the legislation.  I acknowledge her interaction around that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I also commend her on the vaccine roll-out in nursing homes.  It is very difficult to think back even a year ago, let alone last January and February, on the pressure and horrendous experiences that were seen daily in nursing homes.  They are now in a much better place because of the vaccine programme, even though many people have lost their lives.  Our thoughts are with their families.  The vaccine programme and the roll-out in nursing homes, in particular, is a tribute to the Minister of State and her work.  I commend her on that.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that despite its challenges, the fair deal scheme has given people many options and opportunities.  I acknowledge the various offices around the country which run the scheme and their professionalism and fairness in dealing with it.  It has given opportunities and options to families which may not otherwise have been there.  It depends a lot on the private nursing home sector to make it functional and to give those options.  I join with previous speakers in acknowledging the role of the private nursing home sector.<\/p>  <p>  All nursing homes, public and private, play a very important role.  They are all staffed by people who care deeply for those who live with them.  In the last number of months, however, the private nursing homes sector has faced particular pressures.  I hope that as we catch a breath at some stage in the coming months, we will reflect on the challenges facing the sector, particularly the owner-occupied and owner-managed parts of it, which have to deal with unequal funding from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  They have to deal with the challenge of trying to keep staff in competition with the HSE, which can offer higher rates, or with other care companies.  They are an important component and they need support.  I know the Minister of State will try to level the playing pitch for them in view of that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to come back to a point made by Deputy Moynihan, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v before him, about community generally.  Nursing home care is an important part of community.<\/p> <p>Care in the home is even more important and it should be facilitated and made easier where it can be done.  We are lucky to have extraordinary people providing home help throughout the country.  The role played by home help providers, carers and palliative care nurses, co-ordinated by an amazing team of public health nurses and district nurses, is vital.  However, many families are left trying to put together the jigsaw of publicly funded supports while also trying to source private help.  That puts a huge strain and burden on families and often on one family member in particular.  It would be worthwhile to consider setting up a home care hub in each area that would assist families to identify people who provide home help and home care services.  Families are told to do that online but it is hard to do so when people are working and trying to juggle many responsibilities.  A home care hub in each locality would help to promote and encourage the concept of keeping people in the home.<\/p> <p> To pick up on a point made by Deputy Michael Moynihan, it is important that sheltered housing schemes are not forgotten.  As a huge investment goes into responding to the housing challenge, which needs to be done, we must keep in mind that older people may decide to stay in their community if there is sheltered housing available, along with the appropriate healthcare supports.  For many older people, faith-based supports are important and they can be provided in a sheltered home care setting.  That type of provision keeps communities alive.  All over the country, local community organisations have developed sheltered housing that has enabled older people, in particular, to stay in their communities.  Sheltered housing is often built near, or adjacent to, a community centre, where people can get meals, have interactions with neighbours and attend religious services.  It is a model that keeps rural communities alive and allows individuals to stay among their own people rather than going into a nursing home as the first option.  I hope the Minister of State will consider providing an increased investment in sheltered housing for older people in communities.<\/p> <p> I join colleagues in paying tribute to everybody who has served on the front line over the past 14 months, particularly in the nursing home sector.  It is extraordinary that just as the success of the vaccine programme had allowed us to begin to take a little breath, we got hit last Friday by the cyberattack on the health service.  The service has, once again, shown an amazing capacity to respond quickly and flexibly and the sacrifices being asked of the staff this week are phenomenal.  It is absolutely despicable that somebody would think that a health service is ripe to be attacked in this manner, that it could be subject to a ransom note and that the concerns, illnesses and lives of people are worth the ransom note.  It is an absolutely sad indictment of our world that there are people who see an industry in that.  It is an even sadder indictment that people see opportunities in it for legal challenges and promoting legal services when the focus should be on protecting the information that was compromised and the individuals affected.  We saw during the week a rush to judgment in that regard.  I wish the HSE and the Department of Health well in dealing with the issue.<\/p> <p> The Ombudsman's report on the nursing home sector declared very clearly that younger people in nursing homes are being forgotten.  That needs to be addressed.  The nursing homes commission report last year laid out the future options for the sector.  The lessons of the past 14 months in terms of the experience of nursing homes during the pandemic must be learned and changes enacted without delay.  We cannot wait any longer.  There must be supports and backup for owner-run nursing homes to enable them to rebuild their staff complement and give them a chance to take a break after a very intensive 14 months.  Similarly, staff across our public home care sector will need breaks and time to take stock of what they have had to deal with for more than a year.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State, with her mental health hat on, to put in place a specific programme of mental health supports for nursing home staff and service providers throughout the country, as well as for nursing home residents, to help them come to terms with what they have witnessed and lived on a daily basis for the past 14 months.  After the Covid pandemic, many nursing homes will find that the heart of their community has been taken away.  Many of the residents who made up that heart and were part of their nursing home community for many years were taken by Covid.  Staff and owners will need support to rebuild their communities and allow staff and residents to grieve, in the same way that communities all over the country, separate from nursing home settings, will need the same support.  As the Minister of State begins the process in the next few weeks of planning for budget 2022, I ask that she focus in the mental health side of her brief on rebuilding communities and giving supports to communities to deal with the legacy of Covid.<\/p> <p> Is Bille an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo mar d&eacute;anann s&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte le haghaidh feirmeoir&iacute; agus daoine le gn&oacute;tha&iacute; beaga.

I welcome the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021, which updates the fair deal scheme to give greater protections for farm families and small business owners.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on her work in bringing the legislation forward in such a short period.  Since her election to the House in 2016, the fair deal scheme has been in her focus.  Now, after only ten months of being in office, she has brought it to fruition.  I thank her for that.  It has always been a priority for her and the update to the policy is very welcome.  I also take this opportunity to thank her for her efforts on the vaccine roll-out programme.  She has always been very available to Deputies on all sides of the House in dealing with individual queries, which is greatly appreciated by all of us.<\/p>  <p>  The nursing home support scheme has been in operation since 2009.  As of 31 December 2020, there were 22,755 people participating in the scheme, at an annual cost of just more than &euro;1 billion.  Participants contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant's means are assessed as 50% of the couple's combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The overall aim of the scheme is that participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  Where an individual's assessed weekly contribution is greater than the cost of care, he or she does not qualify for financial support.  Therefore, applicants with substantial assets or incomes are unlikely to qualify for financial support.  The capital value of individuals' principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the scheme for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three-year cap.  Currently, this unqualified cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except where a farmer or business owner suffers a sudden illness or disability and requires nursing home care as a result.  The Bill seeks to address this issue by introducing additional safeguards into the scheme to protect further the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation.<\/p>  <p>  Reforming the fair deal scheme to support farm families and entrepreneurs was a firm commitment in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto in the last general election.  I am delighted to see progress being made in this regard.  The change to the scheme, which Fianna F&aacute;il has long sought, will mean that after a period of three years, the value of family-owned farms and businesses will no longer be taken into account when calculating the cost of a person's nursing home care.<\/p> <p>This will happen when a family successor commits to working the farm or taking on the business.  This change is essential to the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses, allowing them to be passed down to the next generation.  This will ensure that the fair deal scheme is fair, more accessible and more affordable for farm and business-owning families.  This has been a hugely emotive issue for farm families and business owners in communities right across Ireland and one the Minister of State has acted on as promised.<\/p> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the vulnerabilities of many older people, especially those living in long-term residential care.  It is absolutely critical that public investment in long-term care services is maintained for those who need it and it should be increased as our population ages.  We must see more capital investment in facilities for older people to allow them stay in their homes as long as possible - particularly the construction of more dedicated sheltered accommodation.  I am thinking of the ones in my constituency such as Rochestown House in Sallynoggin, Beaufort day centre in Glasthule, Glasthule Buildings, Kilbegnet Close in Dalkey, Ailt and &Oacute;ir in Glenageary and the list goes on.  We are very fortunate in our urban area to have a number of different types of residential accommodation for our elderly which have been built up over time.  However, that is not to say there is enough such accommodation.  Not everybody wants to go into long-term residential care.  The vast majority of older people want to live independently, as the Minister of State knows from her own engagement with the organisations and services for older people.  However, it is essential that not only the private sector but the State looks to plan over the long term for residential care and residential settings.  If we look at the financial contribution, Dublin City Council, for example, has used that quite successfully, although it must be said it was limited.  I would like to see it used in other local authority areas, where people in private accommodation can, if they choose, sell that accommodation and look to step down into accommodation that is council-owned, provided through an associated housing body or through other agencies.  It is very important that we look at this and plan now.  Arguably, not enough planning has gone into it over the last number of years but it is essential we look not only at reforming fair deal, as we are doing today, but also at reform of accommodation and sheltered accommodation for those who may need it over the next number of years.  I hope the Bill will receive cross-party support to ensure these welcome and necessary changes are introduced without delay.<\/p> <p> In the time I have left, I have a query for the Minister of State which she might come back to me on.  I know she may not have the information to hand but I am wondering whether there is an inbuilt review of the fair deal system with this particular change.  If the Minister of State has time she might come back to me on that.  I am thinking of an automatic review in, perhaps, three years because while these changes are welcome, other changes may come to light over the next little while.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have any answer to my final question today but her office might reply to me in writing.  It concerns the promotion and better understanding in the public domain of the power of attorney.  It is really important that knowledge and understanding of that system is out there.  It is not only about, as I said, planning for people's accommodation needs into the future but so people can actually plan for their future if anything happens with their mental or physical needs into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000050#AAA00400","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621525800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State for progressing this legislation which was a commitment in the programme for Government.  It is very welcome, particularly for rural communities, farm families and people with businesses.  The fair deal scheme has been successful, very important and vital in providing community care settings for people.  As the Minister of State knows, the scheme has been criticised in the past for the difficulties with qualifying and the numbers that are on it.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad demographic fact that our country's population is ageing and the care burden is going to increase.  What is also salutary for all of us to consider is that family sizes are getting smaller.  It would traditionally have been recognised that the care for elderly parents would have fallen to sons and daughters.  They might have shared that burden and indeed do every day but there are fewer of those coming through and the burden of care is getting greater.  Also we are living longer, thankfully, but that means we have different needs at different stages and later in life.  Therefore, we must look to try to enhance community care, elderly care and residential care.  That also extends right across the other spectrums of population that are implicated in that, particularly the disability sector.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I welcome this legislation and hope it will go on to improve things but it cannot go far enough in trying to expand it.  It is also the case that every sector of the economy, particularly every sector providing a public service, is looking for more money, and there is not endless money.  We therefore need to prioritise where money should be spent.  We must also create efficiencies in public service spending.  That is an area where we have probably taken our eye off the ball in this last year of crisis.  Certainly, at the end of this crisis we will face very significant challenges to the Exchequer and public payroll.  We are going to have to really get down to the minutiae of how we are spending our money and what we are getting for that spend.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that people would like to stay living at home for longer, where possible.  I hope the Minister of State will look at this again and particularly at new technologies.  There are a lot of new technologies that are allowing people to carry on living at home for as long as possible.  I know of very few people who would be rushing into nursing homes if their quality of life was such that they could remain in their own place.  Most of us would like to remain in our own place as long as we possibly can.  We can see now where technological advancement is going, particularly with home monitoring systems, which have revolutionised the care of people at home.  I am aware of this in rural areas of County Waterford.  Relatives of mine have been facilitated to spend longer in their homes because of home monitoring systems and these should be looked at.  I know there are grants available for those who are challenged but again, we should look at spending more money in this area rather than trying to divert people into community settings, where their care costs much more.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Covid, I raise the reaction of both the public and private sectors with respect to community care of the elderly and people with disabilities.  When it came into the country, the main danger of Covid was that it was targeting the elderly.  I will not rehash the problems we had with elderly people perhaps finding themselves in settings where they were at risk.  I want to give a special shout-out to the health service in general, and those in residential care settings in particular, for the Trojan work they have done over the past 12 months and that they continue to do.  With that in mind, last year the Government announced it would give a temporary assistance scheme to nursing homes, particularly private ones - nearly 80% of the burden falls on them - to support them with costs.  That was done at the outset to provide, in the main, for PPE.  It also went into creating isolation space and also with recruitment.  Those challenges have probably abated somewhat but the money is very much required.  At present we are operating visiting guidelines within the nursing homes and they are being facilitated by the temporary payments because people have been brought on to act as visiting co-ordinators.  This is because we are trying to check whether visitors are vaccinated and to determine what setting the residents are going to see them in, be it in the resident's room as per the protocol, or perhaps outdoors.  We need people to manage all that.  I understand this scheme is due to finish.  Has the Government thought about that or how it is going to support nursing homes to continue these protocols without that money?<\/p>  <p>  The other thing that has been going on for quite some time is the HSE and Health and Safety Authority, HSA, were doing screening testing where outbreaks occurred.  Again, I understand that is to be stood down soon.  Essentially, the HSE has taken a position that where 80% of staff are vaccinated, this testing will finish.  We must be mindful that we have vulnerable people there.  Happily, we have done very well on the vaccination front, especially with the elderly.  Everybody in those settings should now be vaccinated but one imagines there may still be a risk, perhaps with temporary staff cycling through those settings, where someone may carry an infection from one facility to another.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to look again at that money.<\/p> <p> Beyond that I will mention the existing supports.  I was a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and the question of nursing homes and congregated settings came up quite a bit.  There was a massive bias on the committee at times in favour of public nursing homes as opposed to private operations.  Private nursing homes were often presented as being purely for profit, which is not a fair representation.  I know many people in the private nursing home business and they are excellent carers of elderly people.<\/p> <p> In the private care setting there are people who get &euro;1,000 per week in support but in public settings those supports can go up to &euro;1,500, &euro;1,700 or &euro;2,000 per week.  In providing exactly the same care, there is a difference in the country as we support public costs more than private.  As I stated, nearly 80% of the care in the sector is provided by private operations.  That does not make sense to me and tells me there is inequity that should be looked at.  It is very hard to stomach talking about the lack of adequate care in the private sector if we are going to pay them 50% less for doing the same job.  That is something that must be considered.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State is aware of the expert review panel convened to look at concerns in nursing care.  There were 84 recommendations made in that report and perhaps the Minister of State will return to the House at some point to provide an update on where those recommendations are now and on the number that have been implemented?<\/p> <p> Another matter topical in the media for some time is rapid testing.  I am on record as saying I brought the idea of rapid antigen testing to the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in May 2020 but to date we still have not implemented antigen testing.  A recent debacle saw a senior person in NPHET describing rapid antigen testing, which is approved by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as \"snake oil\".  That is more than regrettable and it also demonstrates a medical bias.<\/p> <p> In the past 14 months of the Covid-19 pandemic, I have engaged with senior specialists, some of whom were using antigen testing informally in hospitals to try to guide Covid-19 pathways in their hospitals because there were not sufficient beds.  Those doctors were more than happy to use the test and reported 100% success in identifying people in danger of transmitting the disease.  Nonetheless, the HSE still appears, under NPHET guidance, to have taken advice that it will not use antigen testing, or it is at least very slow in adopting it.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, when he participated in the proceedings of the Covid-19 committee, supported rapid testing.  He has probably moved base slightly in the past few weeks.  I heard Dr. Holohan describing the Cochrane report as saying antigen tests are effective only 50% of the time but that is absolutely not the case and it depends on what is being measured.  They are effective 100% of the time when detecting transmission levels or when a person is in danger of transmitting Covid-19.<\/p> <p> In this country we are now trying to figure out how to open the economy and get aviation operating in some way in the country.  We have a proven test, and in America testing has been done on more than 300,000 antigen processes, with the rate of false positives at one in 10,000.  The rate of not detecting virus at a high load was zero.  Nonetheless, we are still trying to figure out how we are going to do this.<\/p> <p> Professor Mark Ferguson from Science Foundation Ireland undertook a report on antigen testing at the behest of the T&aacute;naiste and the request for such a process to be introduced.  He was asked how many Departments engaged with him but only one did so, which was the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, was looking at the possibility of using antigen testing for the back end of the year and the reconvening of universities.  On top of this legislation I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Department and consider the matter again.<\/p> <p> Another question raised recently at the health committee was vitamin D supplementation.  There is a large body of international evidence suggesting the major benefits that can be found by supplementing vitamin D, but this does not happen overnight.  Most of us in this country are low in vitamin D levels because we live in northern latitudes and none of is outside enough.  Perhaps from now on we might get adequate sunshine to generate vitamin D but we have not had that up to now so we should have this supplement.  It is a very cheap fix for many problems and it is well regarded and known to benefit immune supports over years.<\/p> <p> I have spoken with a number of doctors who have used vitamin D deficiency as a marker in determining patients who could have adverse outcomes from Covid-19.  Some of those doctors gave a presentation to the health committee and, to be fair, that committee produced a very substantial report on the benefits of vitamin D.  Despite that, we cannot get NPHET to make any public pronouncements that people in general in the country should have these supplements.  It is a cheap process and it is a small number of people in different patient cohorts who need to watch their vitamin D levels.  They can do that in conjunction with GPs.  The levels being spoken about for the majority of the population are in no way dangerous and could be beneficial.<\/p> <p> Not alone has the message not got out but it has been obstructed, like the message on antigen testing.  That has been obstructed by NPHET and I do not know why.  I have said many times before on record in this House and in committee rooms that the test is used widely everywhere.  We must seriously consider how to revive the economy.  I am thankful we are making good progress on the vaccination front but we will still need rapid testing and ways to test in case of future outbreaks, potentially of variants.  Antigen tests will play a part in that.  Will the Minister of State take back that message to the senior health officials, including those in NPHET?  They are not listening to me and do not seem to be listening to the wide body of science or other medical opinion outside of what is in their own think tank.  That has been a problem for some time.<\/p> <p> I congratulate and say \"well done\" to the Minister of State on the legislation.  I welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000051#BBB00200","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621526400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>It gives me great pleasure to speak to this Bill, which amends the nursing home support scheme.  Like others, I compliment the Minister of State on her doggedness and determination to get this Bill before the House.  It has been a difficult year for the Department of Health and great recognition and praise is due to the Minister of State that in the space of 12 months, she has managed to get this Bill to the floor of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  I was president of a farm organisation when the fair deal scheme was introduced in 2009.  At that time we saw the unfairness in the fair deal scheme, and unfortunately it has taken from 2009 to now to get amending legislation to take that unfairness out of the process.  As Deputy Calleary has said, there are still some matters we would like to discuss to ensure there are no anomalies in this new legislation.  I am nonetheless thankful this will take away the major financial hardship that farm families and small business owners have had to endure over a long period since the fair deal scheme was introduced.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen farm families being brought to their knees financially in trying to meet the contribution to fund the fair deal scheme.  It brought hardship on them when a farm is just an ability to make a living for farming families.  The main wish of the majority of farmers is to pass that farm, intact or improved, to the next generation.  Unfortunately, when ill health strikes and a person must go into a nursing homes, for example, the initial contribution is 7.5% per annum with no cap and this puts huge pressure on the family farm structure.  This Bill, as a result, is most welcome and many people will breathe much easier with the introduction of this cap.<\/p>  <p>  A significant contribution must still be made but that is only right.  Where an asset exists, a contribution should be made, and this will be done over three years.  The continuous drain with no end is being taken out by this legislation being brought forward by the Minister of State.  I cannot give her enough credit for the haste with which she has brought the legislation before the D&aacute;il.  We were both elected in February 2016 and we pressed a former Minister of State, former Deputy Jim Daly, when he held the relevant position in the previous Government.  There were many false dawns but it is great day for the Government that it is now on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I praise it highly.<\/p>  <p>  I will make another few points to the Minister of State when I have the opportunity to speak about care for the elderly.<\/p> <p>As other speakers have said, people's main aspiration is to be able to stay in their own home as long as possible.  With regard to home care and extending home care, I am aware it is a solid ambition of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to improve the home care system currently in place.<\/p> <p> On the package that is there and the home care workers and support teams that go around to individuals to help them stay in their family residence for as long as possible, a point was made to me about the shortness of the visit being imposed.  This needs to be looked at.  The duration of the home care visit by the home care worker in the home must be a reasonable level.  This is not just to make sure the person can get all the work done.  To attract home care support workers into the scheme we also must have consideration that the person has to be able to make a reasonable income from it.  To expect the support worker to come in and have half an hour or three quarters of an hour at one location and then to rush to the next location does not make sense with regard to getting the work done from the perspective of job satisfaction and from an economic and practical point of view, such as allowing people to earn a reasonable income.  These workers are going to be a key part of our healthcare going forward.  I am aware that the Minister of State is fully committed to home care support and that she will take these observations on board.  It can really benefit a family.  Everyone has a lot of commitments, we live in a rat race of a world and we have financial commitments to meet.  To be able to devote the time to look after the elderly in the family can be very taxing.  This support from home support teams can make the complete difference between trying to keep an elderly relative in their home or having, regrettably, to put them into a nursing home.<\/p> <p> During Covid we saw the excellent care delivered by nursing homes and the huge pressure they came under.  Unfortunately there were cases of clusters in nursing homes but the precautions and care taken by nursing homes with their patients during Covid must be commended to the highest degree.<\/p> <p> Members have all been lobbied by private nursing homes.  The contribution they get from the State per patient needs to be looked at.  The public bed costs roughly 170% to 180% what a private care bed gets from the HSE.  This must be examined going forward to make sure there is a level playing field and to make sure the private nursing homes, which are a key part of our health system, are able to continue and do so viably.  In the days when we had pre-budget submissions and pre-budget lobbying these nursing homes had lobbied us all intensively.  In my view, they made a very solid case for themselves.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this to see if the contribution paid by the HSE to private nursing homes could be increased to make sure their viability is not threatened.<\/p> <p> The roll-out of the vaccine for the elderly has been excellent.  I commend the Minister of State on it.  I made representations to the Minister of State about some people who were housebound and she really got her shoulder to the wheel to make sure it happened.  The National Ambulance Service got involved and there was a very speedy delivery of what was a very tedious process to visit people in their homes to make sure those people, who were probably the most vulnerable in our society, got the vaccine.  It was done with great speed and great efficiency.  We had a few outliers for a couple of weeks, but when representations were made they were taken care of very quickly.  Again, it was a job extremely well done.<\/p> <p> Thankfully, the vaccine roll-out is going exceptionally well.  We have a lot of critics in this House but not a lot of them are standing up to praise the vaccine and the way the Department of Health has handled the roll-out.  It has exceeded all expectations with the level of efficiency and the amount of people per week who are getting vaccinated.  Hopefully, we are over the hump with the roll-out and we are coming down now into the younger age groups.  This will greatly benefit the opening up of our economy, for which we all yearn.<\/p> <p> This Bill has taken an awful lot of pressure off a lot of families around the country.  It will stand as a testament to this Government.  It was in our programme for Government and we have delivered on it within a year.  It is most welcome legislation.  I am delighted to be able to speak to it.  When the Bill was introduced I was wearing a different hat, but I saw the unfairness of the system.  It is great to be part of the Government that is taking that unfairness out of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000052#CCC00200","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621527000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>Like previous speakers I commend the Minister of State for bringing this legislation before the House.  Sometimes one marvels at how resistant the system is to change and how long it takes to achieve change.  When someone does bring a measure before the D&aacute;il that changes the system, albeit long argued for and long promised, they are to be commended.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on that.  As Deputy Cahill has pointed out, it removes a potential unfairness from the fair deal scheme.  The scheme is excellent and is availed of by many.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill removes a potential unfairness in the scheme.  Where there is an asset, and where people have to pay something towards the support of their family member, it is not unfair.  It is unfair, however, if the entire asset is dissipated, especially in circumstances where it is a working asset and where a family member is willing to take it on to farm it or work in the business.  Just because a person became unwell or aged more rapidly than he or she had anticipated and did not have time to transfer their assets, it should not be a reason the entire asset is dissipated or that the person should somehow be disadvantaged.<\/p>  <p>  The five-year rule, by which anything that has transferred within the previous five years is looked at, does seem a little unfair.  I can, however, appreciate why it is there.  We do not want somebody on the eve of going into a nursing home dissipating all of his or her assets and somehow frustrating any attempt to have to pay.  I understand why the five-year rule is there but it does seem a little bit unfair.  I am aware that the Minister of State has officials in the Chamber who would say that the line has to be drawn somewhere.  I accept that a line must be drawn somewhere and I will come back to this drawing of the line towards the end of my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Like many previous speakers I wish to talk about the need to resource home care packages adequately.  In fairness, the Minister of State is well aware of this and I know it is something she intends to move towards.  I do not want to seem churlish in any way by pointing to that or to diminish the achievements of the Bill.  They are an achievement of this Government and of the Government I have at times been highly critical of.  It is a particular achievement of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I would take the credit when it comes because, as she well knows, it does not come very often in politics.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State was a member of the committee for Covid-19.  Deputy Shanahan said there was a bias in the committee against private nursing homes.  I am not entirely sure I agree with that.  There was certainly a strong bias by some members of the committee against private nursing homes, but I am not entirely sure that this was a bias of the committee as a whole.  I rather think it was not.  Many committee members realised that private nursing homes exist to fill a lack of capacity by the State, which the State has not managed to fill.  The State certainly should provide more nursing home care.<\/p>  <p>  A new site, St. Joseph's, is one of the things that have been pledged and I look forward to it being delivered.  I was delighted that Raheen District Hospital, which was effectively slated for closure when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 2011, is certainly flourishing now.  It is a huge asset to the community and one that is very close to my own heart.  It means a lot to people to know that their family members are looked after.  One cannot put a financial value on that.<\/p> <p>This is equally true of private nursing homes as it is of State nursing homes.  The one my family member was in is a public home.  I have been critical of the visiting regime and I endorse what Deputy Shanahan said about antigen testing and anything that enables visiting to take place safely.  I am not saying that we should abandon our duty of care to the residents because it is their home and it has to be protected but anything that can make it safe should be looked at.<br\/><br\/>I very much agree with what Deputy Shanahan had to say in respect of vitamin D.  NPHET's attitude to antigen testing and vitamin D is inexplicable.  I have spoken to doctors who are respected in their profession and communities and who hold very senior positions of responsibility in our hospitals.  I am not a doctor, and I do not ever wish to pretend I have any medical expertise.  However, these doctors convinced me that there is a correlation between vitamin D inadequacy and the ill-effects suffered when people contract Covid-19.  This attitude to vitamin D and antigen testing is inexplicable and is almost dogmatic.  Of course, dogma is the polar opposite to empirical science.  We are told we are being led by science in this regard.  I digress slightly and I will return to the issue.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas Committee on Covid-19 made a number of recommendations.  I see Deputy Durkan, who was also a member of the committee, in the Chamber.  The report of the committee stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe State is over reliant on institutional care for our vulnerable population.  This issue was starkly highlighted by the Expert Panel report and was also a central theme of the Committee's Interim Report on Covid-19 in Nursing Homes in July 2020.  The Committee is grateful to Professor Kelleher and the Expert Panel for providing a blueprint for the further care of the elderly and will make recommendations accordingly.  The Committee is of the strong view that future moves to support the older people at home must have, as a priority, a publicly funded and publicly provided model of care that is underpinned by community intervention teams from the HSE. <\/blockquote> <p>I know this is not something the Minister of State has forgotten about but I fear it has the potential to be forgotten.  The committee recommended that an implementation plan be drawn up in respect of the recommendations contained in the report of the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel, which was the panel chaired by Professor Kelleher, with a requirement to provide six-monthly progress reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee also recommended that standards regarding staffing and staff ratios in nursing homes be developed by HIQA.<br\/><br\/>This goes back to the idea of home care.  I am not unique in believing that the latter is essential.  I was not here for all of the debate, and I appreciate the fact the Minister of State is here to listen to all of it.  That shows a certain attitude to the Parliament and it is one I respect and I am grateful for it.  I heard Deputies Cahill, Calleary, Moynihan and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referring to this idea.  This view is broadly held across the House and it is something that I hope we will see some movement towards in due course.<br\/><br\/>While we are all grateful for the fact nursing homes exist, I do not know how I would react if and when I am put in one.  I would say the same of the Minister of State.  It may become an inevitability some day but if it is an inevitability, it is one we all want to put off for as long as possible in the context of ourselves and our loved ones.  I have seen that our loved ones will put it off for as long as possible, and understandably so.  We need to move towards care in the home and in the community even from a humane and societal perspective.  If the past 12 months have taught us anything from a disease control and infection control perspective, it is that we have a further reason to move towards care in the community.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister of State to this because it needs to be highlighted.<br\/><br\/>The alternative to care in the home is a risk of institutionalisation, and I appreciate that some nursing homes are far more institutionalised than others.  Two very recent HIQA reports happen to pertain.  One, in respect of an unannounced visit to Cahercalla Community Hospital and Hospice, was published on 9 April 2021.  The visit took place on 20 January 2021.  It has to be said it was in the midst of the Covid outbreak and in fairness to Cahercalla this has to be borne in mind.  HIQA stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tA system of communication was in place throughout the centre that included loud speakers on every unit.  This was used to call members of staff to different areas of the centre.  Inspectors found this system to be intrusive distracting and incongruent with an environment that is meant to be a residents home.<br \/><br \/>Inspectors observed some residents watching television or listening to the radio to pass the day.  However, over the three days of inspection there was limited social engagement observed between residents and staff.  One resident explained that she had not had access to a newspaper for a couple of weeks and that while she had a radio and access to television, a read of the newspaper everyday kept her going.  Limited access to meaningful activities and little opportunity for social engagement are repeat findings from the inspection last September. <\/blockquote> <p>These are the two passages I wish to highlight from the report in respect of Cahercalla.  A report on St. Joseph's Hospital was published on 11 May, the unannounced inspection having taken place on 10 March.  Again, this was during a Covid outbreak, in fairness to the staff and management of St. Joseph's Hospital, and it should be borne in mind.<\/p><blockquote>\tDuring conversations inspectors were told by residents that they were not allowed to have showers as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Residents spoken with were of the understanding that if assistance was required this meant that the option of a shower was not available for them.  Inspectors reviewed the care records and spoke with care staff.  Records evidenced that there were periods of months where residents did not have a shower.  This was discussed with the nursing management who took immediate action and on day two of the inspection all residents that chose to have a shower were facilitated to have one. <\/blockquote> <p>I do not draw this to the attention of the Minister of State to beat her up over it or to beat up the HSE or the management teams at Cahercalla or St. Joseph's.  All of us, the Minister of State included, would accept it is not acceptable as, I am sure, would the management of St. Joseph's and Cahercalla.  We need to move away from this.  It is not enough to accept that it is unacceptable.  We need to move forward.  We need to move towards care in the home and in the community.  If anything, not being able to choose when to eat or what to watch on television, or whether to watch television, and not being able to choose what newspaper, if any to read, shows how important this is.  There was a time in my house the <i>Irish Press<\/i>had to be read every day, and it had to be the <i>Irish Press<\/i>.  To some younger Members of the House, this is of no consequence but Deputy Durkan has a certain understanding.  I am making the point that autonomy is hugely important.  It is part of what gives us dignity as human beings.  It is better served by care in the community if and when possible.  I urge the Minister of State to move, if possible, in this direction.<br\/><br\/>Another point I want to bring to the attention of the Minister of State is a slight unfairness that has emerged in the existing system.  As the Minister of State is aware, the nursing home support scheme, which she is reforming - I congratulate her on doing so - essentially means that a person who is a resident of a nursing home is able to borrow money that pays for his or her care against an asset.  He or she borrows this money from the HSE and it is repayable to the HSE.  It is against an asset and is capped at 7% a year and now will be capped at three years.  All of this is excellent.  Rightly, this money has to be repaid and it is set out in the primary legislation that the interest shall start to accrue following the person's death.<\/p> <p>That is all dealt with by way of statutory instrument and it could be changed at the stroke of a pen.  The way it is set out is as follows.  There is an interest rate set out.  It is 0.02% per day payable on the overall amount until it is repaid.  That is entirely fair.  The rate is 8% a year.  I suppose 8% a year seems high because interest rates are so low.  When the statutory instrument was introduced in 2009, however, interest rates were probably a bit higher, and were certainly a higher than they are now.  When the nursing homes support scheme was introduced way back, interest rates were much higher.  As a result, 8% a year seems low.  Interest is not payable where the money is repaid within a year of the person's death.  If they do not pay, however, it all becomes payable thereafter and payable from the moment of death.<br\/><br\/>The point I would make, and I think the Minister of State will agree, is that this has not been an ordinary year for regulating affairs in terms, for example, of selling part of a farm - if it is a farm that is involved - if that is what is required.  Obviously, the vast majority of people will do a lot rather than sell a piece of a farm.  To repay the money, they will try to refinance and get a loan, as Deputy Cahill said, in order to keep the farm together and pass it on to the next generation.  It has not been an ordinary year in terms of going to solicitors, banks and, where necessary, auctioneers.  The statutory instrument states: &quot;Interest shall not be payable on a repayable amount which arises from a relevant event or a deferred relevant event where the repayable amount is paid within the period of time specified in Regulation 3(2)(<i>a<\/i>) or (<i>b<\/i>), as the case may be.&quot;  It also refers to &quot;the period of 12 months from the date of the relevant event or deferred relevant event, as the case may be ... .&quot;  What I would urge the Minister of State to do, by way of a further statutory instrument, is merely to say, &quot;the period of 12 months from which can be deducted any time that we were in a level 5 lockdown.&quot;  That is not unfair.  I am not suggesting that people should not have to repay the money.  Of course, they should have to repay it.  I am not saying that there should not be an interest rate.  Of course, there should.  It is merely the period of 12 months about which I am concerned.  Interest does not start to accrue after the 12-month period; it starts to accrue from the moment of death.  It is quite punitive in that regard.  I urge the Minister of State, in light of the year that we have had and given the unfairness to which this can give rise for some people, to look at whether that period could be extended by, for example, including the wording, &quot;In the context of Covid-19, periods of level 5 restrictions shall not be taken into account.&quot;  It is a few of words but it would bring a great deal of fairness to bear.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate that this is not something the Minister of State can decide here and now, but it is something I would urge her to look at in the interests of fairness.  Like Deputy Cahill, I who was brought up on a farm family.  Deputy Cahill, unlike me, was chairman of a national farming association.  Fair is fair.  If one has an asset, one has to repay the money.  However, the timeline that is provided for in the relevant statutory instrument is something that I would urge the Minister of State to look at in the context of the year we have had.  In terms of contacting professional people, I think the Minister of State will agree that it was all quite difficult.  Even contacting the Department was quite difficult.  People were working from home.  That was, of course, true of any of the professionals that one would need to go to in order to regulate affairs after somebody's death.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Minister of State on bringing this Bill before the House.  It introduces a degree of fairness.  If a person has an asset and he or she is availing of a service, that asset should be used to pay for the service but there should be a cap on that where it is something like a family business or a farm that is being farmed by the next generation.  I am aware that the idea of a designated successor is slightly controversial and has the potential to be unfair.  The Minister of State has agreed to look into that to see what can be done.  I again congratulate the Minister of State for having brought some small bit of change to an institution that sometimes looks completely impervious to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000053#DDD00200","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621528200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I cannot see anybody else offering so I call the Minister of State to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000055#FFF00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1621528200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their valuable contributions.  I greatly appreciate the positive words and the cross-party support for the Bill.  We have heard many contributions over the past three days.  I understand that the Bill is technical and complex in nature and that there will be some further work required to refine it as it passes through the Houses.  I look forward to working constructively with the House to achieve the best possible outcome for families with farms and businesses.  We will work through the details of the Bill on Committee Stage and consider any amendments tabled by Deputies.  As I already indicated, I will also have a small number of Government amendments.  It is my sincere hope to progress this Bill through the Houses as quickly as possible in order that this long-awaited measure can begin to have a positive impact on the lives of families with farms and businesses across the country.  Indeed, I am already in talks with the select committee to have Committee Stage taken next month.<\/p><p>This is a complex Bill, as I have said, involving many legal considerations, but its core aims are straightforward: to ensure fair treatment for farm and business-owning families without impacting negatively on the future sustainability of the scheme, thereby preserving access to care for those who need it.  The Government recognises and acknowledges the real concerns that farm and business families have had for many years regarding the fair deal scheme.  This legislative change will address the uncertainty faced by family successors to a farm or business as they will now be able to operate that business or farm in the knowledge that the maximum charge on the property for the person receiving care services will be 22.5% of its value, provided all of the conditions of the scheme are met.  This will assist in protecting the future viability and sustainability of these productive assets for many families.<\/p><p>Farms are traditionally passed down by families through generations and it is important for rural communities that farms can continue to operate within the family unit and be maintained as sustainable productive assets.  Small farms, in particular, play an important role in supporting rural employment and maintaining the social fabric of rural areas.  This amendment will help sustain rural communities by encouraging the orderly succession of farms to family successors, encouraging young farmers to remain farming, and potentially encouraging family members who had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the important contribution of the business community, particularly small, family-run businesses, to Irish society.  As someone who worked in a small family business for many years, and sold both the <i>Irish Press<\/i>and the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, I know how important it is that we recognise and value the investment of time and effort that business-owning families have made, and their equally strong desire to pass down their livelihoods to the next generation.  The preservation of smaller family-owned businesses is a priority for the Government and has been a key focus of the supports we have provided throughout the pandemic.<\/p><p>I again thank all the Deputies who spoke on the Bill and raised important questions.  I will address some of their points now, although there will be more time to discuss them in detail on Committee Stage.  I will first address the matters that were raised in respect of the provisions of Bill.<\/p><p>Several Deputies asked whether retrospective payments will be considered for contributions to the cost of care already paid by nursing home residents with farm or business assets.  This matter was examined in detail and, unfortunately, retrospective payments will not be possible.  Retrospective application of the proposed legislative changes would create a challenging precedent, involving high legal and administrative costs and risks, in attempting to apply retrospectively a complex set of conditions.  Following the contributions by Deputies Harkin and Fitzmaurice, however, I wish to make clear that the absence of retrospective payments does not prevent a person who is already in the scheme from availing of the three-year cap.  The time that a person has already spent in care counts when making up the three years to quality for the cap.  If, therefore, a person has spent five years in care, he or she can qualify for the relief from further contributions straight away once he or she appoints a family successor and meets the other conditions of the relief.  Similarly, if a person has spent two and a half years in care, he or she can avail of the cap after he or she has paid contributions for the final six months and has met all the other relevant conditions, including the appointment of the family successor.  However, the family successor must still be committed to working the farm or business for six years from the date he or she is appointed.<\/p> <p>Deputy Pringle raised a number of issues regarding the operation of the scheme, including when the three-year cap will apply.  The three-year cap will always apply after three years have been completed within fair deal, provided that the family successor has been appointed at some point in those first three years.  However, applicants would be advised to appoint their family successor as soon as possible after they enter care services, so that the six-year period which the family successor must commit to can begin.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pringle also mentioned the situation where an identified family successor who may have been working abroad returns to run a farm or business when a parent needs care services.  When applying to appoint a family successor, the applicant must declare, by way of statutory declaration, that the farm or business asset had been actively worked for at least three of the five years before he or she entered care services.  The family successor does not have to have worked the farm in that period as long as it was being actively worked for at least three of the five years by the person in care or his or her partner.  One point to note is that the family successor does not need to provide proof of income or having worked the farm at this point.<\/p> <p> The review process was also mentioned by Deputy Pringle.  Although it is expected that most applicants will only appoint one family successor, this amendment allows a person in care to appoint multiple family successors to multiple different assets, although only one family successor can be appointed to any given asset.  Once the three-year cap applies, the HSE will review each appointed family successor to ensure compliance with the conditions of the scheme.  There will be an appeals process for all decisions made by the HSE.<\/p> <p> I continue to hold the view that the scheme should not be extended to change the method of assessing income from productive assets that are subject to a lease agreement.  The policy intent of this amendment is to protect family farms and businesses that will remain within the family as a source of employment and income into the future.  This policy would not be advanced if income from leasing arrangements was included in the cap.<\/p> <p> I would also like to thank Deputies for their contributions on matters that extend well beyond the scope of this amending legislation.  It is heartening to hear the commitment across all parties to the improvement of older people's care in Ireland.  I am particularly encouraged by Deputies' support of existing Government policy, which is to support people to live in their own homes and communities for as long as possible with the correct wraparound supports.<\/p> <p> As Deputies are aware, the programme for Government commits to the introduction of a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes which will provide equitable access to high quality, regulated home care.  To advance this, I am committed to establishing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  Work is ongoing in my Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the ongoing reform of the health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p> <p> This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme, the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.  Regarding the development of a regulatory framework for home support services, I am pleased to say that the Government gave approval on 27 April to draft a general scheme and heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for publicly funded for-profit and not-for-profit home support providers.  I intend to progress this general scheme and heads of Bill as a priority with a view to bringing it through the Houses at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, real progress is being made that will enable us to put the scheme in place.  I expect the national home support office in the HSE to be established this year and sanction has been provided for the appointment of 128 assessors to roll out the use of the standardised tool for the assessment of care needs.  I have championed the single assessment tool in opposition and in government as I know it will be a vital part of improving how care is delivered for older people.  I look forward to bringing this legislation to Government and anticipate strong cross-party support for it.<\/p> <p> In the interim, 2021 saw unprecedented levels of investment in home support, with an additional 5 million hours provided to support older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.  This means that 23 million home support hours will be available this year to support people to live well and age well at home.<\/p> <p> Deputies also emphasised the need for broader reform of services for older people, including the development of new models of housing to support older people to age in place.  Experiences over the past year have provided us with clear indications of where and how services need to be improved.  The work of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel is a very important element of this and I am fully committed to its ongoing implementation.  I also fully support the collaborative working that is ongoing under the joint policy statement, Housing Options for Our Aging Population.  We must ensure that these and other strategies and plans deliver real change for the older people of Ireland.<\/p> <p> Several Deputies highlighted the impact in communities where homes are left vacant for a period of time as a result of residents being in long-term care.  It has been proposed that rental of these homes might alleviate the housing crisis.  However, this brings with it real challenges and high risks of unintended consequences.  There is no other exemption of rental or other business income from assessment in the scheme and care needs to be taken to ensure that incentives do not incentivise premature entry to care or create financial abuse or other safeguarding risks.  It is also important to note that there would be complex legal and other impacts and responsibilities arising for residents and their families, including eligibility for reliefs and benefits they may currently be entitled to. <\/p> <p> Throughout their contributions, Deputies emphasised the critical importance of ensuring that the fair deal is fair.  Therefore, we must ensure that any incentives do not undermine the principle of fairness at the heart of the scheme or create precedents that would undermine its financial sustainability into the future.  These challenges are not, however, wholly without solution and I believe that working constructively with Government colleagues on this matter will bring results.  My Department is actively working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this issue.  I am certain that we can work together to devise and bring forward policies in this area that are targeted, equitable, safeguarded and based on robust evidence.<\/p> <p> My priority at this time is to bring forward the legislation for farmers and small business owners without delay.  In the meantime, I am committed to working towards bringing forward an amendment on Committee Stage on extending the three-year cap to the proceeds of the sale of a principal private residence.  This proposed amendment relating to the three-year cap, which is the subject of this Bill, is grounded in the principle of fairness that is fundamental to the fair deal scheme and seeks to remove a disincentive to those who would otherwise choose to sell their home.  It is also targeted at bringing into use those homes that would otherwise be vacant for many years.<\/p> <p> I also thank Deputies for their contributions that relate to wider questions of the financial model of the scheme and the balance between public and private provision.  These are important questions that the Department is actively considering and will be an integral component of the overall reform of services for older people.<\/p> <p> Finally, I would like to emphasise the extensive range of supports provided to all nursing homes throughout the pandemic.  These have included serial testing, the provision of free PPE, infection prevention and control supports, training, financial supports, the availability of 23 Covid-19 response teams and temporary accommodation for staff.  Under the temporary assistance payment scheme, up to &euro;92 million was made available in 2020 for nursing homes, with up to &euro;42 million available for 2021.<\/p> <p> The last 14 months have been an incredibly challenging and difficult time for people living in nursing homes, their families and nursing home staff.  However, the advanced stage of the vaccination programme across nursing homes has had a considerable impact to date with the current positivity rate at 0.11% and the number of outbreaks reduced to five.  To put this in context, there are currently 571 registered nursing homes operating across the country.  I would like to join with each and every one of my colleagues who have over the past three days complimented and paid tribute to the incredible work that has been done in the nursing home sector, including private, public and voluntary services, over the past 14 or 15 months.  It has been an extremely difficult and challenging time for all. <\/p> <p> To conclude, as a Minister of State from a rural constituency, and based on my own experience in family business, I am fully aware that family farms and small businesses form the backbone of our economy.  They perform a vital role in providing employment and enhancing the future development of rural Ireland.  I am also aware that farmers and small business owners often do not see their farm or business as an asset, but rather as something they are taking care of for the next generation.  It is, therefore, essential that these farms and businesses are protected so that they remain viable and sustainable assets for families long into the future.  This legislation will deliver a fair deal for these families, enhancing protections and improving the accessibility and affordability of long-term care for farm families and small business owners.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Deputies' support for the Bill as we move to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000055#FFF00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621529400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nursing Home Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Referral to Select Committee","time":1621529400,"counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Health pursuant to Standing Orders 95 and 181. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621529400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1621529400,"counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jennifer Whitmore - to discuss concern regarding a &quot;Do not consume&quot; water notice in Barndarrig, County Wicklow; (2) Deputy Alan Farrell - to discuss the quicker than expected growth in the renewable electricity sector within Europe; (3) Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor - to discuss engagement with SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to facilitate additional apprenticeship places across the system; (4) Deputy Dara Calleary - to discuss the design funding and operation of the defective concrete blocks, pyrite or mica scheme; (5) Deputies Louise O'Reilly, Darren O'Rourke, Kieran O'Donnell and Sean Sherlock - to discuss job losses at Aer Lingus and the urgent need for a survival and recovery plan for the aviation sector; (6) Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan - to discuss theory test and driver tests; and (7) Deputy Neasa Hourigan - to discuss the steps the Government will take to curb the amount of planning being allocated to build-to-rent developments.<\/p><p>The matters raised by Deputy Jennifer Whitmore; Deputy Neasa Hourigan; Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor; and Deputies Louise O'Reilly, Darren O'Rourke, Kieran O'Donnell and Sean Sherlock<i><\/i>have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH00700","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1621529400,"counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The Minister is present for the first Topical Issue matter raised by Deputy Whitmore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH00900","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The Minister is not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH01000","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I think he is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH01100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am here to take a later Topical Issue matter.

On 9 February this year, a \"do not consume\" notice was issued as a result of high nitrate levels in the water supply.  It has since been reissued, just this week.  A \"Do not consume\" notice is particularly difficult to deal with during a pandemic, but the residents of Barndarrig have been patient.  They have been waiting for Irish Water and Wicklow County Council to deal with this issue, but there is still not clarity on when the \"Do not consume\" notice will be lifted and what solutions Irish Water is looking at to ensure it can be lifted and that it will not happen again and on why the nitrate levels were so high in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  There are a couple of immediate issues for the community in Barndarrig.  The water which is being left for them is in 5 l bottles.  It is being left outside in plastic bottles in the sunshine.  There are huge littering issues as a result and the bottles are not handy to use, particularly for elderly residents, because they are quite heavy and cumbersome.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an issue with that water in that it has quite a high mineral content.  Numerous people have been saying their kettles are being destroyed by the content of the water.  I have asked Irish Water to put in a tanker in combination with the water bottles and I am hoping the Minister of State will be able to let me know tonight it will happen.<\/p>  <p>  There are also issues in terms of the communication.  The \"Do not consume\" notice was issued three times over the past number of months, but the residents in Barndarrig have said they have not received much communication from Irish Water on this issue.  They would like clarity on what is happening.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on what Irish Water is doing, whether it has a timeline and endpoint for this \"Do not consume\" notice, whether there is any indication of what has happened to cause those high nitrate levels and what Irish Water's solutions are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH01800","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Whitmore for raising this important issue.  My priority in these situations is always to ensure that people's health is protected.  The Deputy will appreciate the operation of the Barndarrig public water supply is a matter for Irish Water which, since 1 January 2014, has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as environmental regulator, is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU directives and national regulations for the provision of drinking water.<\/p>  <p>  However, from inquiries which my Department has made with Irish Water, I understand the \"Do not consume\" notice currently in place for the area supplied by the Barndarrig water treatment plant was issued on 9 February 2021.  This followed consultation between Irish Water, Wicklow County Council and the Health Service Executive, HSE, to protect approximately 213 customers in this area, due to elevated levels of nitrates in the water supply.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note this is not a boil water notice as boiling the water would not reduce nitrite levels and is, therefore, not a suitable measure to make the water safe to consume.  However, the water can still be used for sanitation and hygiene purposes, including hand washing which is critical during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water, together with Wicklow County Council, continues to arrange an alternative water supply by providing bottled water at a location in Barndarrig to support impacted customers, in accordance with current Covid-19 restrictions.  Delivery of water supplies are also being arranged for vulnerable customers who are registered on this supply.  However, as the Deputy requested in her opening remarks, I will raise this issue with Irish Water in terms of the tanker to which she referred.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water is installing additional equipment at the water treatment plant, which will treat the water to reduce nitrate compounds and this will help safeguard the water supply at Barndarrig.  The Irish Water team is working to install and calibrate this equipment, which will take a few weeks to complete.  Once this work is completed, Irish Water will consult with the HSE with a view to lifting the \"Do not consume\" notice.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's priority is to ensure people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for personal hygiene and the washing of hands during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We all want to see this notice lifted without undue delay, but only when the HSE and the EPA have confirmed the water supply is safe.  Additional information and advice is available on Irish Water's website or by calling Irish Water's 24-hour customer care line.<\/p>  <p>  Both our water and waste water systems require substantial and sustained investment to bring the systems up to the quality and resilience standards required of a modern service, provide for population growth and build resilience in the face of climate change.<\/p>  <p>  As part of budget 2021, I secured funding of more than &euro;1.4 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies throughout Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH01900","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1621529400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and for saying he will look into the issue of the tanker.

I am also pleased to see it looks as though it could be just a matter of weeks before the notice can be lifted.  That is a positive statement.<\/p>  <p>  A continuous biochemistry monitor was to be put on the system.  Does the Minister of State know when that will happen, or is that equipment part of what is going on at present?<\/p> <p>The issue of communication is a simple one but it is important to the people of Barndarrig.  Irish Water has notified local media about matters and puts information up on its website but in a small rural community like Barndarrig putting information in the local shop is also a good way to reach people.  We are only talking about 213 houses so it might be possible for Irish Water to write directly to those residents if there is significant news.  That would be appreciated.<\/p> <p> The other issue I wish to raise is that while Irish Water has put in place drinking water supply plans, Barndarrig has not been prioritised.  Due to the vulnerability of this system, I ask that Irish Water reprioritise it and ensure that a plan is put in place for Barndarrig because there have been many periods of vulnerability and water supply issues in the area.  From a more long-term perspective, we need to look at why there are such high levels of nitrite in that water supply, and see where it is coming from and what remediation measures can be put in place to ensure this does not occur again in the future.  We need to make that community's water supply more robust and sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000057#HHH02000","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621530000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.

As already stated, my concern is that people's health is protected.  I want these notices lifted without delay but only when the water is again safe to drink.  Irish Water is working closely with the authorities and monitoring the situation to ensure that happens as quickly as possible.  Irish Water's primary function is to provide safe, clean drinking water to customers, treat waste water and return water safely to the environment.  In providing these critical services, Irish Water plays a role in enabling social and economic growth and protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of the public.<\/p>  <p>  As a single national utility, Irish Water is taking a strategic and nationwide approach to asset planning, investment and meeting customer requirements.  However, our entire water system will need substantial and sustained investment over a number of investment cycles to fully improve performance and resilience.  Investment will also be needed to deliver new water capacity for our growing population and to deal with the increasing impacts of climate change.  Prioritising the order of the work and the associated investment will require ongoing engagement between Irish Water and its regulators, the EPA and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of necessary water outcomes and to improve overall water system resilience.  As Deputy Whitmore requested, I will ask Irish Water about the nitrates monitor and I will also raise the issue of communication.

We had a meeting with the Taoiseach earlier in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The plan that will allow aviation to reopen in a safe way is to be launched next week and the digital green certificate has been announced for the end of June.

The State is paying the PUP to staff who have been temporarily laid off.

The Government must start subventing those jobs, keep the employees on the payroll and ensure they can get through this period of turmoil.  It must enable us to retain those jobs in future and save our Aer Lingus airline.  That is the important point to be made.  I ask the Minister to please not come with the response that he has already given &euro;80 million to the aviation industry, because nothing specifically has been given to the airline sector.  People will tell us that schemes, such as the employee wage support scheme, EWSS, and the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS, were devised for other sectors.

These included the temporary closure of its base in Cork Airport from September to November this year and the permanent closure of the cabin crew base in Shannon Airport.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I met the CEO of Aer Lingus yesterday.  Among other things, we discussed yesterday's announcement, which is deeply regrettable.  I acknowledge the difficult and unprecedented challenges being faced by Aer Lingus and its staff and the cost pressures leading to the ultimate decision to restructure the company.<\/p>  <p>  The continued international crisis in aviation is increasing the pressure on all firms in the industry.  All airlines have variously issued capital, raised further borrowing, drawn on Government supports or taken measures to reduce their cost bases or both.  Major European airlines, such as Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, and IAG, have announced many thousands of job cuts.  I assure Aer Lingus and the wider aviation sector that the Government is fully committed to supporting the industry and we acknowledge the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of the employment supports before the end of June.  We recognise as well that the critical issue for the industry is a roadmap for the restoration of international travel.  The Government intends to set out a pathway for the gradual reopening of international travel at its meeting next week.  I hope there will be an extensive D&aacute;il debate and statements on the issue next Tuesday, which will enable Deputies to set out their thinking in that regard.  <\/p>  <p>  We also met yesterday with the CEO of Shannon Group and the managing director of Cork Airport to brief them on the situation and to reiterate Government support for the airports and their important role in regional development.  Similar engagements occurred between the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the unions and employer representative groups in her capacity as chair of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, and its aviation subgroup, at its meeting this week.  The Government is acutely aware of the devastating impact Covid-19 restrictions are having on the aviation sector nationally and across the world.  We are committed to ensuring that the aviation sector will be in a position to rebound quickly when the public health situation allows.  <\/p>  <p>  Government supports continue to be used to aid companies and their staff throughout this crisis.  Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made significant funding available to Aer Lingus and other aviation enterprises through a range of business supports.  It is estimated that by the end of June 2021, the sector will have received approximately &euro;300 million in such supports.  The bulk of those supports was in the form of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, programmes, which were specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees.  An additional &euro;32.1 million is also being provided in respect of support for Cork and Shannon airports this year.  My Department is also assessing applications for funding to the State airports under the auspices of the &euro;20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme, and the Minister of State expects to be in a position to provide funding to Cork and Shannon airports under this scheme shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  All our thoughts today are with those impacted by the announcement by Aer Lingus yesterday and with all those in the aviation industry who continue to be impacted by the biggest crisis this sector has ever faced.  I assure workers and all those involved in the aviation industry that the Government will continue to support the industry and to review the supports which may be required in the months to come.  While we are not yet able to permit the restoration of international travel, work is under way to ensure that we are prepared for exactly that situation.  Until then, the Government will continue to provide supports to the aviation sector, as we do to all sectors of the economy.  Aviation has been particularly badly hit.

I have spoken to representatives of Aer Lingus and Cork and Shannon airports.  The answer to the Deputy's question is \"Yes\".  The decision to shut Cork Airport to upgrade the runway to ensure the long-term success of the airport was a strategic decision made by the airport authority.  When I spoke to representatives of Aer Lingus yesterday, I asked them specifically whether the possibility of the airport remaining closed had any influence on the decision or if there is any sense that the airport will not open again after the runway is rebuilt.  The answer was \"No\".  I was told that it was an appropriate decision to take to use this period of very limited air travel to upgrade the runway.<\/p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy O'Donnell's question, connectivity will absolutely return to Shannon Airport.  It is vital.  In fact, I expect that as Cork Airport shuts down in September for the runway to be upgraded, we will see an immediate return of flights from Shannon to make sure that the south-western region has connectivity.  However, it cannot be just that.  There must be connectivity with the US and other new areas.  It will take time, but those airports will return and the jobs will return with them.  Our attention is firmly fixed on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  When I am in discussions with representatives of the airports and the airlines, they are more concerned about, and desire more than anything, an understanding of the timeline in respect of the reopening of international travel.  As a Government, we committed to providing that timeline by the end of this month, which we will.  Statements on aviation due to be made in the D&aacute;il next week will be a most useful opportunity for the members of the Opposition to set out their views as to what that plan and timeline should be.  I look forward to hearing what every Member has to say.  There will be plenty of time during statements to go into the detail of the matter.<\/p>  <p>  In reflecting upon what we have heard here, we need to be ambitious and get our aviation sector back.  We must heed public health advice, but with the roll-out of the vaccination programme, there is the possibility of a return to travel.  I have not heard many experts in the area or people in the international sector, or indeed domestically, cite the fact that antigen testing will be key or critical in that regard.  I have heard that in respect of the digital green certificate.  Antigen testing will have a role to play in widespread screening to enable the return to offices and colleges.  I am happy, by all means, for a Deputy to show me an example of international efforts where antigen testing is being used to provide widespread screening to enable air travel.  However, and from what I hear and see, it is not the key issue.  The key issue is the application of the digital green certificate and the extension, in effect, of the traffic light system that we have introduced.  This will enable a return to travel and ensure that we can get connectivity back with our colleagues in the UK, US and Europe, in particular.  In truth, in the start-back phase, it is most likely that we will see a return of air travel with those countries that are vaccinating their populations at the same rate and following the same timelines as us.

The action plan aims to deliver 10,000 apprentice programme registrations per year by 2025.  Everyone learns in different ways.  The plan to provide a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for both employees and apprentices are great, but we are currently facing serious difficulties in respect of apprenticeships because of the pandemic and the delays in the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  I have been contacted by several constituents in Carlow who have highlighted the delays that apprentices are currently facing.  Basically, what should have been a four-year apprenticeship is looking like it will be six or seven years.  These are hard-working young people who will be here to pay taxes for many years to come, hopefully.  However, these delays are going to hinder their opportunities to travel and see the world.  They have been held back significantly as a result of the Covid pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  This age group have suffered so much.  Many of them worked right the way through the pandemic in essential services.  Apprenticeship courses did not provide the same remote learning options as many other courses.  One constituent of mine started their apprenticeship in October 2019 and should be qualified and finished in 2023.  Their first college phase should have started in September 2020, but it has been postponed until October 2022, two years later than expected.<\/p>  <p>  Taking an apprentice electrician as an example, it normally takes four years to complete the programme.  Phase 1 lasts three months; phase 2, 22 weeks; phase 3, a minimum of six months; phase 4, ten to 11 weeks; phase 5, six months; phase 6, ten to 11 weeks; and phase 7, a minimum of three months.  Phases 2, 4 and 6 are college-based, and for those apprentices who were due to complete these phases in the past 14 months, there has been a major issue.  It must be addressed.  I am most concerned that this delay will have a knock-on effect on additional college places.  One of my greatest concerns is whether there will be sufficient college places available.  <\/p>  <p>  What is the plan to address this issue and what is the solution?  We will be crying out for fully-qualified tradespeople as older qualified people retire, and they will not be finished their apprenticeships.  That is without mentioning the domino effect it will have.  We know that we will badly need tradespeople in the years ahead due to the housing supply issue.  This is the sector that is most reliant on apprentices in the workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  Having equal access to an apprenticeship irrespective of background, gender or age should be an option for all.  However, if a person signs up for an apprenticeship, he or she should be able to complete the required phases of learning properly.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to stress how hard everyone has worked during this pandemic.  People have made sacrifices.  I know that the Minister understands that, given that he has responsibility for third level education.  We have seen students trying to work from home and having to tackle problems with broadband and other issues.  The pandemic has had a major effect on them.  In respect of apprenticeships, some apprentices will face a two-year delay in completing their courses.  That is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Apprenticeship programmes should be an option within the national education and training system, transforming them from a well established route to a career in niche areas such as the crafts sector, to a well established route to a broad range of careers that are attractive to both employers and learners.  If we do not address this backlog, we will have difficulty meeting that goal.  I look forward to hearing about the work the Minister has done in this area to address the issue, particularly in respect of my own area of Carlow.<\/p>  <p>  I have received several phone calls about this issue.  It is a concern and a worry.  Some of the apprentices who have approached me about the issue are paying bills and are finding it very hard.  They had a plan that they would qualify by a certain date and now that has been extended.  I want to know what work has been done on this issue.  I  look forward to hearing the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000060#LLL00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1621531200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this important topical issue.  Indeed, it is most timely because I spent the afternoon in a training centre in Glasnevin with our electrical and plumbing apprentices.  I engaged very directly with the apprentices, talked to them about their experiences and heard their insights in respect of the Covid pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned in her contribution, apprenticeships sit at the very heart of plans by the Government and myself to build a genuine third-level education and training system, one that recognises that we all learn in different ways.  Sometimes the earning and learning model can be a very useful one.  We want to ensure that we have an apprenticeship system that crosses the further and higher education sector, and one that brings together employers, education and training providers and our national skills infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  It has a crucial role to play in taking us out of the Covid-19 crisis, as apprenticeship programmes also provide a rapid route to economic recovery.  There are currently 61 apprenticeship programmes in our country, 25 of which are what are referred to as craft or traditional apprenticeships.  They have a largely standardised seven-phase programme of on-the-job and off-the-job training.  Off-the-job training is delivered in phases 2, 4 and 6 of a craft apprenticeship in ETB training centres, institutes of technology and technological universities.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, as the Deputy has alluded to and as we all know, the Covid-19 related suspension of face-to-face training in the education and training sector has had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to access off-the-job training.  The public health advice was that some of these measures could not proceed in the interests of safety for a period.  When permissible, face-to-face training is operating at approximately 50% of normal capacity to ensure adherence to public health guidance.  That training is now back, but operators must adhere to social distancing rules and follow the public health guidance.  This has also exacerbated the increasing pressure on training facilities, which had been growing as a result of the 90% increase in the apprentice population over the past six years.  Indeed, we had great success as a country in growing the apprentice population.  The combined impact of all of these factors has resulted in what the Deputy correctly referred to as a backlog in electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery and motor mechanics apprenticeship programmes, in particular.<\/p> <p>The combined impact of all this has led to what the Deputy correctly refers to as a backlog, particularly in electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery and motor mechanic apprenticeship programmes.  Remote training was introduced for craft apprenticeships assigned to off-the-job training phases from January 2021 and great credit is owed to all the staff, trainers and apprentices for this.  They managed to put in place online learning for craft apprenticeship programmes, something that had never been done previously.  That at least allowed them to progress with the theoretical parts of their courses.  However, the core of a craft apprenticeship is not theory.  It is a practical programme, and the practical nature requires apprentices to attend on site to be able to access equipment and to demonstrate their competency at practical tasks.  As such, the Government has prioritised craft apprentices for a return to face-to-face learning.  A phased return has been allowed since April, so that is the good news.  They are now back as part of a phased return.<\/p> <p> Simply returning to current Covid levels of delivery or, indeed, to pre-Covid levels will not be enough, for all the reasons the Deputy outlined.  I have taken some immediate actions to support the expansion of the craft apprenticeship training infrastructure.  I am delighted to inform the House that I have secured &euro;20 million in additional capital expenditure, which I have allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system to deal with the backlog and the concern voiced by the Deputy.  This is in addition to the &euro;12 million which has already been allocated to support additional classes and to put in place additional teaching capacity to ameliorate the Covid-19 measures.  SOLAS and the HEA are working intensively with the education and training providers to identify additional solutions to address the backlog for the off-the-job element.  The Government will not be found wanting in providing any resources that are required to help in this.  I am satisfied that with the extra &euro;20 million and the fact that apprentices are now back in the practical classes, we will eat into this backlog in the coming months and get on with the delivery of the action plan on apprenticeships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000060#LLL00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621531800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>That is very good to know.

The Government is going to do two specific things.  We are allocating the &euro;20 million to provide extra supports, and if we need to do more we will do it.  We have given it to the HEA and to SOLAS and they are examining what practical measures they can put in place to reduce the backlog.  Second, and importantly, we have prioritised getting the apprentices back to their practical face-to-face provision.  That is in place since last month.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the technological university for the south east, I thank the Deputy for her support for this project.  I am delighted to tell her that, before I came to the Chamber this evening, I wrote to the HEA about the appointment of the international independent panel, the advisory panel.  That is the next solid step.  I am not pre-empting that but, subject to things going well, we will deliver on the date and get the doors of the technological university for the south east open on 1 January 2022.  It will be a major day for Carlow and the south east.  We will keep talking about Carlow College as well, and I know we have work to do on that.<\/p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are very much at the core of the Government's education policy and the economic recovery policy.  We want to do five things.  We want to get more apprentices - 10,000 each year by 2025.  We want to ensure there are more diverse people involved in apprenticeships, especially more women.  We want to make sure there is a broader range of apprenticeships.  I am delighted with the roll-out of a new apprenticeship programme in hairdressing, for example, in recent weeks.  There are 17 more apprenticeship programmes in the pipeline.  We want the public sector not to just lecture people but to step up and play its part.  We want it to hire 750 apprentices every year by 2025.  Every county council, State agency and Department has a role to play.  We also realise we cannot deliver on this agenda without businesses, so we want to provide more supports for businesses, including financial supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is prioritising apprenticeships and will continue to do so.  We must end the narrow, elitist and sometimes, sadly, snobby attitude we have to third level education in this country.  We must recognise everybody learns in different ways.  There is no right way or wrong way, just many different ways.

I will begin by being honest in saying I do not like it.  I do not like it as a model and it did not exist when I was working in architecture.  I do not like the fact there is a two-tier standard of housing that differentiates between what you might need when you are renting and what you might need when you own a building.  I do not like the lower standards it engenders and that apply to build-to-rent versus owner-occupier units, and I do not like that Irish residents will be paying rent in perpetuity, mainly to foreign funds, for the pleasure of living in what I consider to be substandard housing, especially since the rents are often unsustainable at present.<\/p><p>However, even if I did like build-to-rent, I would still be concerned.  The increasing prevalence of any typology in a particular area is a problem, especially in Dublin.  It is an emerging issue in my constituency of Dublin Central.  The <i>Dublin Inquirer <\/i>recently published an article which stated that between 2018 and 2020 as much as 70% of housing units granted permission in Dublin City Council were build-to-rent.  My own review of strategic housing developments and their applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the past year in the Dublin City Council area indicates a similar number, with approximately 65% of units being build-to-rent.  In my constituency there is a single forthcoming development in Clonliffe College of more than 1,600 units, and 1,300 of those will be build-to-rent.  That is the size of a small town.<\/p><p>There will always be a need for rental accommodation.  People will need it for the short term, the medium term, the long term or for a particular life stage.  They might need it for a certain type of employment or for financial reasons.  They might need it just because some people like to rent and do not want to buy.  We must have rental housing stock, but we do not need low-quality housing stock.  Build-to-rent units have no requirement for cross-ventilation, minimal requirements for storage and minimal requirements for community amenity.  They have a 5% variation, which means that there can be units that are smaller than the minimum requirement.  They have relaxed fire safety regulations so there are no lobbies to kitchens and there are lower ceiling heights.  There is a variation for sprinklers.  That does not engender confidence in build-to-rent as a typology.<\/p><p>I am not sure that, when the then Minister with responsibility for housing introduced build-to-rent guidelines, he envisaged the level of uptake we see at present.  I hear a great deal about social mix from other parties when we are developing sites.  I believe we need a balance with build-to-rent developments.  We limit the amount of social and affordable housing in developments.  We should now, at a minimum, have a percentage cap on the build-to-rent element of any site, if not an outright ban.  That balance is needed for sustainable communities so they do not become dominated by transient housing models.  Those housing models are not transient because of the people in them, but because people do not want to live in them for long as they are not up to standard.<\/p><p>In November last year, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage produced a welcome report on co-living developments.  On foot of that report, the Minister took the view that the number of applications and permissions was too high and decided, effectively, to ban co-living.  That was the correct decision in my view.  I ask that the Department commence a similar review of what is happening with build-to-rent and the impact it is having on the market in inner city areas.  We must make a conscious decision about the appropriate levels and locations for this type of development because every community deserves to have quality housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000061#MMM00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1621532400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  Members will be aware that what happened in Maynooth is not acceptable, as the Government moves quickly to address this issue.  The Taoiseach was clear from the outset that the Government does \"not want institutional investors competing with first-time buyers\".  He went on to say that, \"Our priority is first-time buyers.\"<\/p>  <p>  The actions taken yesterday by the Government are evidence of the priority we have given this matter and our commitment to levelling the playing field for ordinary people who rightfully aspire to owning their own home.  I will return to this in a moment but in the first instance, I want to clear up any confusion that may exist between buy-to-rent and the recent bulk-buying of houses in Maynooth by institutional investors.  For absolute clarity, let me state that the development in Maynooth did not go through the planning system as a build-to-rent development and, therefore, was not designed or planned as such.  Concern around planning permission being allocated to build-to-rent is, therefore, not entirely accurate in this case.  <\/p>  <p>  The Maynooth issue has arisen as a result not of the build-to-rent application or planning permission but, rather, the standard-type planning permission with which we are all familiar.  It was only after the planning process had concluded that the developer chose to sell all remaining units to an institutional investor whose intention to rent those units was not part of the original planning process.  Prior to 20 May, if applicants or developers did not seek permission specifically for a build-to-rent development, they were still free to sell or rent any or all of the units, which included selling the units to anyone who wished to rent either one or all of the units.  This is what gave rise to the issue of concern in the context of the Maynooth development.<\/p>  <p>  I will summarise the issue and the way we addressed it.  Yesterday, 19 May, saw the issuance of new ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to address the regularisation of commercial institutional investment and regulations in certain housing developments.  These guidelines will ensure new own-door houses and duplex units in housing developments are not bulk purchased by commercial institutional investors in a way that would cause the displacement of individual purchasers and-or social, affordable and cost rental units.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, intends to bring further changes through in the Affordable Housing Bull 2021, which is currently before the Oireachtas, to enable local authorities specify a minimum percentage of these houses and duplexes solely for the purchase of owner-occupiers.  Specific proposals will emerge in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important for me to clarify the actions taken and that the reasons they were taken were different than those suggested by the Deputy in the question she posed.  In that regard,  I want to directly address the question posed and explain that the planning is not allocated.  It is up to applicants or developers to seek planning permission specifically for build-to-rents, which permission has particular conditions and requirements attached.  I will briefly summarise them.  Chapter 5 of the Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities addressed the relatively new and emerging build-to-rent sector and set out a number of key and distinct characteristics of this type of accommodation and relevant planning requirements.  Build-to-rent projects are usually a single entity investment for a long-term rental undertaking comprising individual residential units within the development that are not sold off separately for private ownership and-or subsequent subletting individually, which is a key difference from the traditional housing development model.  The guidelines provide for planning permission for specific build-to-rent developments to be sought from the planning authority.  Where such permission is applied for, the proposed development must also include the provision for dedicated amenities and facilities, specifically for residents, in terms of communal recreational space and works spaces, as well as a range of other support services.  My point is that there may be room for build-to-rent as envisaged and provided for in the planning guidelines while, at the same time, ensuring that safeguards are put in place to protect first-time buyers and owner-occupiers.<\/p>  <p>  Perspective and balance are also important.  Let us look at the data.  Build-to-rent developments form a relatively small proportion of the planning applications lodged.  As of February 2021, 48,397 residential units in total have been approved under the strategic housing development process, comprising 12,991 houses, 27,624 apartments and 7,782 build-to-rent units.  Build-to-rent makes up 16% of the total residential units approved under the strategic housing development process.  The amount of build-to-rent developments approved is currently, therefore, relatively small.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000062#NNN00100","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1621532400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  As he said, build-to-rent makes up 16% overall but that figure is 65% in my constituency.  That is a predominance of build-to-rent.  I take the Minister of State's point about Maynooth but we might just stick with the issue around the quality of build-to-rent accommodation.  It is a lower standard and there are lower requirements for storage and public amenities.  Even those people who rent should have a place to park their prams.<\/p>  <p>  I want to bring to the Minister of State's attention something that has been raised in the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and not only by me.  Some 13% to 15% of the population has a disability.  Such people are more likely to be living in poverty and less likely to be purchasing their own homes.  A considerable proportion of those people live in private rental situations.  The minimum requirements for spatial set-outs in build-to-rent are fundamentally in conflict with the rights of people with disabilities.  A 5% variance on spatial standards means that a studio or one-bedroom apartment of 37 sq. m can be brought down to 35 sq. m.  That is a tiny amount of space without any room for storage.  There is no generosity in that space.  We already know there is an issue in accessing the home adaptation grant for private rental properties.  There is no likelihood that the significant proportion of the Irish population who have a disability can seriously use the 65% of build-to-rent permission in my constituency.  That is the outsized impact that build-to-rent has on areas such as Dublin Central.  I would very much like if it was 16%.  <\/p>  <p>  For the record, I have no objection to professional landlords and landlords who are running properties in bulk.  My query and concern is about the standard of the buildings we are now putting in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000062#NNN00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1621532400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her interest in the matter, which I know is genuine.

We are also updating a new strategy, on which consultation is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  The question posed illustrated some confusion or misconception that may exist.  I want to clarify the point about the curbing of planning or allocations for build-to-rent developments.  I must say categorically that planning is not allocated.  It is up to the applicant or developers to seek the planning permission specifically for build-to-rent, which has particular conditions and requirements attached, as I outlined earlier.  Housing and planning, and how they interact, are complex, as the Deputy will know.  As Minister of State with responsibility for these matters, I am grateful to have the opportunity to put the facts before the House and to dispel any confusion that may exist.  I genuinely hope I have tried my very best to do this today.  There are some real and tangible issues and I do not underestimate the impact that all of these have on our everyday lives.  The Government has demonstrated by its actions that it does not want, in the first instance, institutional investors competing with first-time buyers and, for the Deputy's information, the new guidelines are now available on the Department's website, as I said.<\/p>  <p>  I have already stated that affordable housing for buyers is a key priority for this Government.  Legislation, namely, the Affordable Housing Bill, is currently passing through the Oireachtas.  Giving first-time buyers a realistic chance is important, allowing them an aspiration of realising home ownership.  It is important to recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate and Government policy must be broad and diverse enough to meet the varied housing needs of a modern, cosmopolitan society.  A mix of typology is required for a varied market and in meeting the needs of one cohort, we cannot ignore another.  That is why it is important to recognise the complexities involved and to ensure that in addressing one particular issue, we do not inadvertently create problems in another area.  We have given careful consideration to all these measures and I will outline and raise the Deputy's concerns in terms of design with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000062#NNN00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1621532400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and the Deputy.

In particular, &ldquo;the Acts&rdquo; means the Social Welfare Acts, &ldquo;the Board&rdquo; means the Citizens Information Board, &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; means any social welfare assistance, benefit or payment provided under the Acts, &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Social Protection, &ldquo;officer of the Minister&rdquo; includes, with regard to supplementary welfare allowance, an appropriate employee of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and &ldquo;social welfare system&rdquo; means the system for giving assistance to persons in accordance with the Acts.<\/p> <p> Section 3 sets out the social welfare principles that: the social welfare system contributes to realising economic, social and cultural rights that are indispensable for personal dignity and the free development of human personality; the social welfare system progressively achieves commitments made in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 45 of the Constitution; social welfare is an investment in the people and is, accordingly, for the public good and general benefit; the delivery of social welfare is a public service; respect for the dignity of persons should be at the heart of the social welfare system; the social welfare system should contribute to reducing poverty; the social welfare system should be designed on the basis of evidence; the social welfare system should be progressively improved in ways which put the needs of those who require assistance first and advance equality and non-discrimination; and the social welfare system should be efficient and should deliver value for money.<\/p> <p> The section provides that all those concerned with the interpretation or administration of the Acts or performing functions under them must have regard to the social welfare principles.  In addition, a court or tribunal in civil or criminal proceedings may take the social welfare principles into account when determining any question to which the principles are relevant.  Nothing in this section of itself, however, gives rise to a cause of action in respect of anything done in the administration of the Acts or the performance of functions under them.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides that a social welfare charter is to be prepared, published and from time to time reviewed.  The charter must set out what is to be expected from the Government and the Minister when developing social welfare policy, from the Minister, his or her officers and others when administering the Acts or performing functions under them and from persons who apply for and receive assistance through the social welfare system.<\/p> <p> The charter must reflect the social welfare principles, as spelled out in the Bill, and the Minister must prepare the charter within six months of this Act coming into operation.  In preparing the charter, the Minister must consult the board and persons who receive assistance through the social welfare system, or their representative bodies, together with such other persons or bodies as he or she considers appropriate.  The Minister must lay a draft of the charter before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their prior approval and make the charter publicly available by appropriate means.<\/p> <p> Section 5 requires the Minister to review the charter within five years of its being made, and every five years thereafter, involving the same consultation process.  Following that review, the Minister must decide whether to make any changes to the charter and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report setting out the consultation undertaken in carrying out the review, the reasons for the decision to make changes or not, and if the Minister has decided to make changes, a draft of the charter showing the changes he or she intends to make.  The Minister must lay a draft of any changes to the charter before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their prior approval.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides that a court or tribunal in civil or criminal proceedings may take the social welfare charter into account when determining any question to which the charter is relevant, but that a failure to comply with the charter does not of itself give rise to grounds for any legal action.<\/p> <p> Section 7 deals with the Minister&rsquo;s duty to promote take-up.  The section provides that the Minister must keep under consideration what steps he or she could take to ensure that persons are given what they are eligible to be given through the social welfare system, and where the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, take any of the steps identified by that consideration.<\/p> <p> For this purpose, the Minister must have regard to the importance of communicating in a way that ensures persons who have difficulty communicating with regard to speech, language, and so forth can receive information and express themselves in ways that best meet their personal needs.<\/p> <p> The Minister must have regard to the importance of providing information in a way that is accessible for persons who have a sensory, physical or mental disability; the importance of ensuring that any information required to be given to a person is done so in a format that is accessible to that person, and that any information required to be made publicly available is done so in formats that are accessible to persons with a sensory, physical or mental disability; the possibility that information obtained for the purpose of determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility for one type of assistance might be used to identify his or her eligibility for other types of assistance; and the role of the independent information, advice and advocacy services provided by the board in ensuring that persons are given what they are eligible to be given through the social welfare system.  The steps to be taken by the Minister must include measures to provide, or ensure the provision of, information about the independent information, advice and advocacy services provided by the board to applicants.<\/p> <p> Section 8 requires the Minister to prepare a strategy to promote take-up, which sets out his or her best estimate of the extent to which all those eligible for assistance through the social welfare system are being given the assistance they are eligible to be given, and the steps under section 7 that the Minister intends to take during the strategy&rsquo;s lifetime.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides that, where, in the course of determining a person&rsquo;s entitlement to assistance, it appears to the deciding officer that the person may be eligible for other assistance, the officer must so inform the person, and if it is not reasonably practicable for the officer to proceed with a determination of the person&rsquo;s entitlement to that other assistance, he or she must provide the person with information about how to apply for it.  This does not preclude an officer from requesting further information for the purpose of determining the person&rsquo;s entitlement to the other assistance.<\/p> <p> Section 10 provides that officers of the Minister must comply with a person&rsquo;s wish to have another person, that is, a supporter, present during any interview relating to the person&rsquo;s entitlement to assistance, unless the wish is unreasonable.  The role of such a supporter shall be to support the person in question during the interview, including making representations on the person&rsquo;s behalf.  The Minister is not required to provide or pay for a supporter.<\/p> <p> Section 11 confers the following additional functions of the Citizens Information Board to scrutinise legislative proposals in accordance with section 12.  It must prepare and submit to the Minister, or to an Oireachtas committee, a report on any matter relevant to social welfare that the board is requested to examine and report on.  It must also prepare and submit to the Minister and both Houses of the Oireachtas, and publish, an assessment of the extent to which any or all of the expectations set out in the social welfare charter are being fulfilled and make recommendations for improvement where those expectations are not being fulfilled.  In performing its functions under the Bill, the board must have regard to the social welfare principles and it may consult any persons it considers appropriate.<\/p> <p> Section 12 provides that where the Minister proposes to make social welfare regulations, he or she must first inform the board of the proposals, notify both Houses of the Oireachtas that he or she has done so and make the proposals publicly available by appropriate means.  Having been informed of the Minister&rsquo; proposals, the board must then prepare a report setting out its observations and recommendations and submit a copy to the Minister and both Houses of the Oireachtas to publish the report.<\/p> <p> When laying regulations or draft regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister must also lay before both Houses either a response to the board&rsquo;s report on the proposal for the regulations or a statement explaining why the Minister considers it appropriate to lay the regulations or draft regulations before the Houses before the board has submitted its report.<\/p> <p> Section 13 deals with liability in respect of overpayments under the Acts.  It provides that a person who is liable to repay the value of any assistance that was given due to an error is not so liable if the error is neither the person's fault nor the kind of error that the person could reasonably be expected to notice.  An error is a person's fault if it is caused or contributed to by the person providing false or misleading information, failing to notify an appropriate officer about a change in circumstances where obliged to do so or causing another person to do either of those things.  In considering whether an error is of a kind that a person could reasonably be expected to notice, regard is to be given to the extent to which the value of the assistance given in error exceeds the value of the assistance that would have been given had the error not been made and whether any information given to the person prior to, or immediately after, the assistance was given would have alerted a reasonable person to the fact that a decision had been, or was to be, made on the basis of incorrect information or a wrong assumption.<\/p> <p> Section 14 requires the Minister, before the end of each year, to prepare a report stating what he or she has most recently calculated to be the impact on social welfare payments of the rate of inflation in the State.  The report would also outline how the Minister calculated the impact, what he or she has done, or intends to do, in the light of the calculations and the reasons for that decision.  The Minister must lay a copy of the report before both Houses of the Oireachtas and make it publicly available.<\/p> <p> Section 15 requires the Minister, as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and publish, a report on the performance of the social welfare system in that year.  The report shall include a description of what the Minister has done in that year to meet the expectations of the social welfare charter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000062#NNN00800","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621533600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Sherlock.

I welcome the Bill and commend an Teachta Sherlock on bringing it forward.  There are some really interesting elements to the Bill and, overall, it aims to improve our social protection system.  That system is quite complex and can be difficult to navigate for some people.<\/p>  <p>  One of the principles of the Bill is that the social welfare system should contribute to reducing poverty.  I acknowledge that it does this already but it is important to say that it must do more.  In the past two budgets, core social welfare rates did not move.  More and more people are experiencing deprivation, according to the figures in the 2019 Survey on Income and Living Conditions.  After the Covid pandemic, especially, we need to see a real focus on tackling poverty.  Part of that needs to be an alignment of all social welfare rates with the minimal essential standard of living, rather than the over and back we see every year as we approach the budget, with announcements of a fiver for this group but not for that group.  Those decisions should be evidence-based and that is where we need to go in terms of our social protection system generally.<\/p>  <p>  It is positive that the Bill proposes the creation of a charter that will reflect the principles that are laid out.  The Bill seeks to ensure that people are provided with information about, and access to, social welfare supports to which they are entitled.  That is really positive.  I am sure many Deputies have dealt with situations where, for example, people are left on illness benefit for longer than a year or two and, as they approach the pension age of 66, realise they do not have the required number of stamps.  People in those circumstances often do not realise that they should have perhaps moved on to the invalidity pension but, by the time they do, it may be too late.  This happens a lot with different payments and schemes.  We see many cases within the social protection system where people are either locked out of receiving supports and face financial hardship as a result or are locked in and made dependent on payments because of impossibly strict eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  An example of what I am talking about is the case of a wonderful young artist I met earlier this week who is partially blind and in receipt of the blind pension.  She has to be careful of every gig she takes and any bursary or award she might win.  Such opportunities can almost be a hindrance because taking them means she risks losing her blind pension, which is her only guaranteed income.  That is wrong.  I cannot begin to imagine what it is like to live with that type of worry when one is partially blind or blind.  As it stands, when people apply for benefits such as the blind pension, they are, understandably, required to submit medical evidence that they are eligible, which in this case means evidence they are blind or visually impaired.  However, they are also subject to means testing of the income of their entire household.  This means that blind and visually impaired people cannot earn a reasonable income by themselves and may be linked to a partner's income, which makes no sense.<\/p>  <p>  We know there is a financial cost to disability.  People do not cease to be visually impaired or blind because their income exceeds a very specific and low threshold or their spouse or partner has an increase in income.  The social welfare system should seek to make people's lives easier, not harder.  When I met the woman to whom I referred, I was reminded of another case that came up in my constituency office nine or ten months ago that also involved a women who was blind and in receipt of the blind person.  When her partner's income increased on getting a promotion at work, she lost the pension.  I ask the Minister to look at this particular payment.  It should be paid to everyone who is blind or visually impaired, the number of whom is small in the grand scheme of things.  Regardless of what they earn or what any person living with them earns, they should be entitled to the blind pension.  When one reviews the list of social welfare payments that are means tested, this one really stands out, particularly where it is something people are dealing with throughout their entire life.  I ask the Minister to look at it.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the charter provided for in the Bill seeks to make access to advocacy and advice on social welfare more readily available.  Citizens Information provides invaluable support to many people seeking advice on their entitlements under our sometimes illogical social welfare system.  By enabling Citizens Information to report on the real-life challenges and successes it encounters, we will have an opportunity to improve the design and roll-out of social welfare measures and support families and individuals in accessing them.<\/p>  <p>  The provision in the Bill on promoting take-up of benefits is really important.  The example I gave regarding illness benefit shows that people may not be informed about, or may not realise, the negative impact of certain scenarios in respect of the social welfare system.  The Minister recently introduced a very welcome change to the one-parent family payment by removing the earnings threshold where the applicant's child is under the age of seven.  I would love to see that welcome change more widely promoted.  People need to know about it.  It would also be great to have access to information on PRSI contributions and stamps.  Under the current system, people can make a request in writing for a history of their contributions.  Many will do so, if they know about it, but it would be useful in this day and age to have some kind of online system, whether an app or something else, that would enable people to log in and track their PRSI contributions throughout their working lives.  They could see where they stand, whether they qualify for things like treatment benefit and how far away they are from the required number of stamps for the State pension.  Something like that would be hugely helpful.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill contains a number of very interesting components.  I commend an Teachta Sherlock on his work in bringing it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000064#PPP00500","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1621533600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>The Minister and Minister of State may wish to combine the time available to them, which is 20 minutes in total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000064#PPP00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621533600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Sherlock for bringing forward this Bill.  It is always good to have a constructive debate in this Chamber and I appreciate that the Deputy's intentions in this matter are absolutely in good faith, with a view to ensuring our social protection system works well for all our people.<\/p> <p>Everybody in this House wants a system that abides by strong principles, one that delivers for its people and ensures they get the payments and services they need when they need them and that all information is given to them to ensure they are availing of the broad range of supports the Department of Social Protection provides.  I do not believe in opposing Private Members' Bills for the sake of it.  However, this Bill, as drafted, raises considerable complexities which could give rise to significant unintended consequences which I will set out.<br\/><br\/>Even before I became Minister for Social Protection, I was aware of - and as a local representative had personal experience of - the great work the Citizens Information Board does for people in local communities throughout the country.  For many people, it is the first port of call for information on services provided by the State.  The work done by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is also a vital support for many people.  Indeed, I have had occasion to refer many people to MABS and they get excellent service there.  The role of the Citizens information Board is set out in legislation and the agency has a very strong working relationship with my Department.  However, this Bill, if enacted, will give inappropriate power to a State body under the aegis of my Department to scrutinise regulations, which could actually lead to delays in implementing urgent legislation.  The appropriate place for oversight of the functions of Government is here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such scrutiny, by bodies other than these Houses, would lead to additional layers of bureaucracy when necessary, and often urgent, action is required.  For example, if this proposed legislation had been enacted early last year, it would have meant that any regulations or legislation that needed to be enacted urgently would first have to be revised by the Citizens Information Board.  That scrutiny is the job of the Oireachtas.  To add an additional layer would have hindered the agile and responsive approach we took in providing immediate income supports to assist people financially impacted by the public health crisis caused by Covid-19.  Many Deputies in this Chamber have rightly praised the work of the staff of the Department of Social Protection.  While there needs to be a legislative basis for our actions, sometimes that action has to be swift so that the right policies are implemented to provide support to the right people at the right time.<br\/><br\/>This Private Member's Bill cuts across constitutional and statutory functions already in place, for example the Social Welfare Appeals Office, the Ombudsman and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Again, while I recognise the Deputy's good intentions of ensuring people can access and are aware of their entitlements, the Bill provides for an unnecessary statutory basis to underpin the excellent service the Department already provides to people in need.  For example, the Department makes significant efforts in promotion and outreach work to make people aware of their social welfare entitlements.  These include promoting the take-up of social welfare payments through numerous online and other media awareness campaigns.  For example, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and I extended parent's leave and benefit to new parents.  That was extended from two weeks to five weeks.  There was a campaign around that and it worked very effectively because in the space of just a few weeks, more than 9,700 parents have taken up the additional leave.  The recent campaign on the enhanced treatment benefit scheme regarding hearing aids also involved a national campaign both on social media as well as in print media.  Even at the moment, my Department is running an ongoing campaign on broadcast media to make people aware of the current problems with scam phone calls.  I again remind people that my Department will never ask for bank details over the phone.  Please do not engage if you get any such phone call.<br\/><br\/>As Deputies will be aware, the Department also provides constant and ongoing advice on eligibility through its nationwide network of Intreo centres and call centres.  With the easing of restrictions, Intreo offices are again open five days a week and our income support helpline also remains available.  The Department regularly consults with customers through its customer fora and is also obliged to ensure its communications are in an accessible format for persons with disabilities.  These are just a few examples of what my Department currently does but of course social protection is much more than the work of one Department.<br\/><br\/>The proposals in the Bill are focused on one Department but do not take due account of the complex range of services provided in the field of social welfare across the policy functions of other Departments.  Delivery of social protection and achievement of social inclusion is not confined to the payment of benefits.  As recognised in Article 45 of the Constitution and in reports like the National Economic Social Council, NESC's, Developmental Welfare State, social protection is a complex interaction of services, payments and active supports that cuts across health, housing, education, rural and community development and employment law.  Accordingly, the development of social protection cannot be progressed in isolation but requires a whole-of-government approach.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the Bill itself, section 2 sets out high level principles to be adhered to in the social welfare system.  However, such principles are already set out in Article 45 of the Constitution and in the Department's statement of strategy.<br\/><br\/>Sections 3, 4 and 5 make provision for the preparation of a social welfare charter.  Again, this appears to be duplication with the Department's statutory requirement to produce a statement of strategy, follow public consultation procedures and for the published version to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I remind Deputies that the Department of Social Protection also already prepares and publishes a customer charter and action plan.<br\/><br\/>Sections 6, 7 and 8 make provision for promotion of social welfare take-up.  As I have outlined, my Department already invests significantly in promoting the take-up of social welfare payments and services in multiple media channels.  I am absolutely open to working with the Deputy if he feels there are areas where we can improve upon this service.  Allowing a person to view his or her PRSI contributions online, as suggested by Deputy Kerrane, is actually a very good idea and something I will certainly look at.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 provides for a support person to accompany a person during a social welfare interview.  In reality, many customers of the Department are digital by desire.  They apply to and interact with the Department online.  Currently there is nothing, bar public health guidelines, to preclude a person accompanying a customer to an Intreo office.  The Department also provides an official translation service where necessary.<br\/><br\/>Section 10 gives very extensive powers to the Citizen Information Board including pre-legislative scrutiny, which is normally a function of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 10(4) provides that:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Board may do anything which appears to it be necessary or expedient for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of its functions under this Act or to be otherwise conducive to the performance of those functions. <\/blockquote> <p>This would create a situation whereby a Minister is held accountable by an agency of their Department to explain the rationale and merits of specific legislative proposals.  This would be done in a context whereby the agency is legally responsible for reporting to the Minister who appoints all members to the Board.  Article 28 of the Constitution is very clear that the Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Section 10(5) of the Bill provides the Citizens Information Board with the right of access to any relevant information held by any Minister, the HSE, local authority or relevant public body that it may reasonably require for its functions provided in this Bill.  Given the broad powers provided by this provision, it is very questionable that this would be in compliance with the principles of General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 of the Bill provides that where the Minister proposes to make regulations under the Social Welfare Acts, he or she must inform the Citizens Information Board, notify the Houses that he or she has done so, and make the proposals publicly available.  The board then has the opportunity to make recommendations in relation to the proposals with no time limit as to how long it may take to consider the draft regulations.  When laying the regulations before the Houses, the Minister is then required to provide an accompanying response to the board's recommendations.  This requirement, if enacted, would add considerable delays to the process of making regulations.  It would have significant, costly and unnecessary intrusions into the business of Government and as I mentioned earlier it would actually have the effect of complicating and slowing down important work.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 provides for a duty to consider the effects of inflation.  This provision does not take account of the fact that the Department undertakes a social impact assessment each year to assess the impact of social welfare measures contained in the annual budget process and how they impact on each income decile.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 makes provision for an annual report.  The Department already submits an annual report every year.  Again, this would represent a duplication of work.<\/p> <p>I hope, in going through the Bill by section, the Deputy will accept my bona fides that my officials and I have examined the Bill in detail.  I acknowledge the spirit in which it has been brought forward and the good intentions behind it but I regret that it would have many unintended consequences, so the Government cannot support it.  However, I assure the Deputy and colleagues throughout the House that my officials and I are happy to work with them if there are areas they feel can be improved.  We all want to ensure our social protection system works as efficiently and effectively as it can for all our people.<\/p> <p> Since the onset of the pandemic, more than &euro;7.6 billion has been paid through PUP, with in excess of 23 million payments issued to more than 850,000 people.  During that period, in excess of 10 million phone calls have been answered by staff in the Department.  That demonstrates very clearly that the Department wants to help and we are here to help people.  Where improvements can be made I am happy to work with Deputies on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000064#PPP00700","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000066#RRR00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000066#RRR00300","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Perhaps I could save some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000066#RRR00400","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>We are all for saving some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000066#RRR00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I can save the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, a little time, if he allows me to intercede at this juncture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000066#RRR00600","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Go on.

It works extremely well for people on a daily basis.  I acknowledge that and as a public representative of some years, my day-to-day interactions with officials within this Department are nothing short of excellent.  The culture that exists is one that seeks to help citizens, and that is self-evident.  From time to time, the process breaks down but those times are few and far between.<\/p><p>This Bill is an attempt to codify a culture and set of principles that are self-evident in the Department.

I have witnesses more people using that service.<\/p><p>Deputy Kerrane made a very good point on PRSI contributions, for example.  This Bill is designed to try to give effect to processes that could be devised to make systems more efficient.  The Deputy proposed notifying people of their yearly PRSI contributions, which might stave off cases where the citizen coming up to retirement has to phone a Deputy, who must then go through a process of engaging with the Department.  I am absolutely delighted to do this on behalf of the citizen but if the citizen had been informed of the PRSI contributions every step of the way, the system would be more efficient.  This Bill is designed with such systems in mind.<\/p><p>I accept the arguments made by the Minister in respect of the Citizens Information Board and I admit I had not thought of it when we devised the Bill.  I accept her offer to seek to engage where there are perceived failures or where improvements could be made.<\/p><p>As an example, I am currently dealing with Aer Lingus workers.  There is a category of workers who because of the Covid-19 pandemic are on what might be called the casual jobseeker's benefit.  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister and we are engaging with her and some of her officials on this.  People are finding themselves on what could be the wrong category of payment and they might need to be in another category so they do not fall off a social welfare entitlement cliff where payments might cease overnight.  This category includes Aer Lingus workers and a new batch of workers that have come on my radar in the past 48 hours from the automotive sector.  These are the Kostal workers in north Cork, Limerick and my home town of Mallow.<\/p><p>These workers may not meet the criteria set out in current policies and principles that determine payments.  This is all to do with the fact that the working week is still Monday to Friday but there should be some changes to the system to have regard to the new categories of workers emerging in society who present for social protection but the payments cease as a result of a round hole with a square peg.  They do not fit a category and are, therefore, kicked from the system.<\/p><p>The purpose of this legislation is to seek to put in place systems so individuals from different parts of the country, when they present a case to a local Intreo office, do not get conflicting information from various officers because a system can be put in place to &quot;triage&quot; such cases.  A red light could be put on these types of queries if a category of worker is encountering difficulties.  It could then be dealt with up the line in a timely fashion.  I am confident the two categories of workers I speak of will be dealt with but my Bill would have gone some way to responding to those types of scenario.<\/p><p>I do not intend to push this to a vote and I accept the Minister's arguments and bona fides about working with Deputies on all sides of the House when matters such as this arise.  If Deputy Kerrane's very innovative proposal was taken up, we would support it.  If that emerges from my Bill falling at the first hurdle, I would not see it as a pyrrhic victory.  We would still progress the social protection system as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000066#RRR01000","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1621534800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank all the Members for their pragmatic approach to this position.
