What is the Government currently doing with the employment recommendations in the report?  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that five years have elapsed since the report landed into his current Department.  Obviously the report was a response to the situation that arose with Clerys at the time.  We know that with many other companies going into liquidation, and most notably Debenhams last year and Arcadia, and more coming down the tracks we now need to see action by the Government.  Last year, we had a lot of commitments and soothing words that the Government was seriously considering the matter.<\/p><p>On 4 November 2020, the two authors of the report, Mr. Kevin Duffy and Ms Nessa Cahill, came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and spoke about what they believed needed to be done to implement the recommendations of their report.  In  particular, they said that the recommendations in the employment law sphere could be implemented, needed to be implemented and that there was no need to do anything on the company law side.  The Government in its wisdom decided to ask the Company Law Review Group what company law measures needed to be undertaken and, almost six months on, we still await the review.  At this point in time there is yet another delay and distraction in the much needed implementation of the recommendations in the Cahill Duffy Report.<\/p><p>We are all very aware of a permanent contraction in some areas.  We know that there are redundancies coming down the tracks in the retail sector and other sectors for which the Government now needs to be ready.  I believe that if we had the report in place we could have saved some of the heartache experienced by the workers at Debenhams and the many days they spent outside day after night trying to fight for what was due to them.  In particular, there would have been advanced consultation on collective redundancies, which is recommendation No. 1 of the Cahill Duffy report, the strengthening of the ability of the State to recover payments from the insolvency fund, which is recommendation No. 4, and increasing compensation to the affected workers by recognising the terms of their collective agreement, which is recommendation No. 6.<\/p><p>In short, if the recommendations of the report had been implemented before last March or, indeed, now for the thousands of workers who may find themselves in a similar situation that there is a mechanism for recognising the collectively bargained <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments that are inbuilt into their collective agreement, and a mechanism for paying that out via the insolvency fund but claiming it back from what remains of the liquidation process.<\/p><p>I ask the Government to get a move on with the report because we cannot afford any delay.  It will be an appalling indictment of the Government if more workers find themselves in a situation where they are left without their fair compensation package arising from a liquidation if the Government has failed to act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#C00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for tabling her Commencement matter and giving me an opportunity to update the House on where we are with this important topic.

The second phase of the CLRG's work, concentrating on the splitting of operations and the sale to connected parties following insolvency, has commenced and the CLRG will report on that work in September of this year.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I have jointly looked at the legislative provisions that deal with redundancy and insolvency from the point of view of both employment law, which falls under the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy English, and company law, which falls under my delegated responsibilities.  The recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report have fed into this process, and in developing our approach we met with the social partners on 4 November last year.  They made submissions to inform that process, and our policy response was issued to them on 11 May 2021.  We are due to meet the social partners tomorrow evening to discuss this matter further.<\/p><p>As part of our response, changes will be brought in under the recently announced small companies rescue package and will provide for the provision of enhanced information on those remedies designed to secure the protection of employees that are already a feature of the existing legal landscape.  In parallel, legislative proposals in the area of company law relevant to the protection of workers as creditors have also been adopted.  While I appreciate that this is a minor development, work continues at a strong pace on the substantive review of corporate restructuring, as I mentioned earlier, and the CLRG is due to report back in September in that regard.  It is our intention to progress this matter as swiftly as possible once the CLRG reports in September.<\/p><p>As for the two proposals we will bring forward on the small companies rescue package, we have given a commitment that that will be done prior to the summer recess of this year.  I also wish to inform the Senator that we have decided to move to establish an independent forum that will consider employment law issues into the future with membership to include stakeholders such as employee and employer representatives, as well as employment law and other legal experts.  This forum's remit will go well beyond addressing redundancy and insolvency matters and will work along the lines of the CLRG.  The intention is that the complementary range of measures will promote the provision of quality information, enhanced participation and transparency, and provide for continued development of employment law, especially with regard to employee rights.<\/p><p>I hope this information is of benefit to the Senator and I thank her for the opportunity to put it on the record of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#C00600","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the very detailed response.

This is a departmental matter and as both the Minister of State and the senior Minister, Deputy Foley, are new in their roles, I will not put the entire responsibility for this on them but work needs to be done in the Department of Education if we are serious about getting our buildings right for the children who spend 183 days of the year in them.  Can the Minister of State confirm how many new buildings have completed design stage with the planning and building unit of the Department?  In a post-Covid-19 greener future, can she confirm that all these new buildings have been designed with whole-school ventilation, fossil-fuel-free heating systems, sufficient outdoor multi-use games areas and safe active travel infrastructure?<\/p> <p>I will deal with each of these four areas briefly.  First, we know that these types of viruses are not going to go completely away and I received a response from the Department, which is currently putting new gas boilers into new buildings.  That is not good enough in this day and age.  At the same time, the Department is also retrofitting gas and oil burners into schools.  It seems to be insane to be wasting money on new gas boilers in new schools when we are replacing them in other schools.  Gas is a fossil fuel and there are plenty of other options now and the Department itself has been doing research on this for more than 20 years.<\/p> <p>Second, on ventilation, many new schools do not have proper ventilation.  I have seen a few new school designs for big secondary and primary schools.  They have ventilation in the toilets and perhaps in the home economics room but do not have a whole-school ventilation system. The best practice now is closed envelope, air to water or air to air with a heat recovery ventilation system.  That is what we want and need.  We see that schools currently are not fit for purpose.  The heating is on and the windows are open.  Those days are over, as this is 2021.  This is important because although we tell children that the climate has changed and that we must do everything that we can, we are not putting them in buildings in 2021 that are designed in a modern way, despite 20 years of research from the Department on getting it right.  <\/p> <p>The third issue I raise is sufficient outdoor space for play.  I spent 14 years visiting schools and all too often I saw the lack of outdoor space.  I see now these new multi-use game areas which are good for basketball and certain games.  In many new schools, however, we do not have new pitches that will be big enough to host any camogie, football or hurling matches.  I refer to one in my home town of Ennistymon in particular, where three schools are being amalgamated into a beautiful new school.  It will have no pitch big enough to host camogie, football or hurling matches, which seems mad in this day and age because there are many sports for which grass is needed.  I am not talking about small AstroTurf or basketball courts but about a proper pitch for the school and the children to be out on and having this space.  It is all about the outdoors now and we want our children and teenagers to have access to that kind of infrastructure in all new buildings.<\/p> <p>The final item I wish to raise concerns safe travel to schools to access the schools.  The Department has been working with An Taisce's Green-Schools: Safe Routes to School, which is a new programme that has come through the Minister for Transport, which is great, but that involves retrofitting and redesigning existing schools.  I am talking about new school buildings that do not have the proper infrastructure for active travel.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They see it as a secondary thing.  I have seen new designs which have winding roads leading to the school and parallel there is a winding cycling and walking route when we all know well a much shorter route could be put in at much less cost to encourage pedestrians and cyclists.  I spent 14 years working full time on behavioural change and traffic jams outside every school in Ireland.  We have to get the new builds right.  We have to look at short, small infrastructure that encourages walkers and cyclists to see there is a quicker, safer route away from cars.  We should not be running them parallel to cars, they cost more and are longer.  It makes no sense.  I would expect and demand better for our children as we move to a scary future with the new design in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#E00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>This is a matter under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Foley, but I am happy to outline the work going on.  On the large scale capital building programme, 135 school building projects are ongoing which are at or have completed design stage.  These include: Gaelscoil Mh&iacute;ch&iacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g; Gaelscoil Donncha Rua; Gaelscoil U&iacute; Choim&iacute;n; Ennis Educate Together National School; Ennistymon National School; Raheen Wood Steiner school; and Mol an &Oacute;ige Community National School in Clare.  There are also in excess of 1,000 school building projects under the large scale and additional accommodation schemes which are across various stages of planning, design, tender and construction in relation to school extensions and refurbishment projects.  All new builds have special educational needs facilities for ASD classes, etc., which is a commitment that was given in the building and planning unit.<\/p> <p>Specifically, on a post-Covid greener future the Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings.  This performance has been recognised at both national and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification.  The Department's technical guidance document set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency.  They are based on solid energy research projects.  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements.  Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through the Department's technical guidance documents.  The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with 53 research projects at various stages, including the energy in education website, a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department's schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current building regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.<\/p> <p>The Senator asked about fossil-free heating systems.  The design guidance also include future-proofing to take advantage of technologies as they become viable.  For example: direct modulating high-efficiency gas boiler systems that can support the integration of heat pump systems; optimum envelope fabric that will not require additional enhancement for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems, low water content radiators and operating temperatures for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems; and the provision of space in new school classroom layouts for mechanical ventilation heat recovery units.  In the interest of sustainability, the potential of renewables is maximised in school design while ensuring that renewable applications are properly suited to needs and reflective of school opening hours and school holiday periods.<\/p> <p>It is also critical that an energy reduction plan is part of any investment in renewable energy applications.  The climate action plan, due for publication in mid-2021, will outline how energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions targets are to achieved.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Josepha Madigan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As part of our continued research, the Department is undertaking a further review of current school design principles based on the new focus of moving from energy-demand reduction to energy-related greenhouse gas emission reduction for public sector bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#F00200","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I am afraid I got nothing new from the Minister of State's response, given that I have heard it previously from the Department.

As the Minister of State noted, we will research whatever is viable but we already know what is viable.  The research has been going on for 20 years.

It is aspirational, but with the shared island fund, that aspiration has become a possibility.  One might say it is infrastructure with various merits, but it is so much more than infrastructure.  It is about moving forward through peace and reconciliation, going back to the time when the Vikings travelled up Carlingford Lough and settled in Newry and Carlingford.

It is a symbolic thing to connect those communities which have been apart for so long because of issues in the Troubles and everything else.  Carlingford Lough is already quite connected through the Carlingford ferry at the mouth of the lough, which goes from Greenore to Greencastle.  This is a good way to connect it further down.<\/p> <p>It has had many false hopes and false dawns over the years.

This followed on from a similar commitment in A Fresh Start - The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan. <\/p> <p>A progress report regarding consideration of options for a Narrow Water bridge was considered by the North-South Ministerial Council in July 2016 and the council decided then that work should continue on the development of options.  Senior officials have been continuing a review of the options, which has included meetings with relevant stakeholders.  In engaging with stakeholders, officials have highlighted the need to assess all potential options objectively to ensure the best possible outcome for the area and the best use of public funds.  Following on from that, the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland started work on the preparation of an outline business case regarding a Narrow Water bridge scheme.  The purpose of the business case is to consider the need to construct a bridge over the Newry River and appraise options to ensure any proposal put forward is likely to represent value for money.  The Department's strategic research and analysis division provided input into this work.<\/p> <p>The proposal for the Narrow Water bridge has to be considered in light of welcome developments with respect to the Newry southern relief road since 2016.  That road would provide an alternative route for strategic traffic that avoids Newry city centre and links to the eastern seaboard key transport corridor, the A1-N1 from Belfast to Dublin.  The Department for Infrastructure has conducted a community consultation on the Newry southern relief road regarding the preferred route.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The current proposal for the Newry southern relief road is likely to include pedestrian and cycling provision, as well as connectivity, to the B79-R173 Fathom Lane leading to Omeath, Carlingford.

As part of the project optioneering, four options are being considered for the Narrow Water bridge, that is, do nothing, a pedestrian cycle bridge only, a bridge that also caters for cars, and a bridge that also caters for buses, coaches and heavy goods vehicles.  The overall assessment of the case for the Narrow Water bridge, including in the context of the development of a wider tourism initiative for the region, is not at a stage where it is a clearly defined and a costed scheme.  Further consideration of any impact on the R173 of any vehicular bridge would also need to be considered.  <\/p><p>On 5 May 2021, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the commitments in New Decade, New Approach in regard to the Narrow Water bridge and agreed that Departments will consider next steps to progress the scheme.

It is of great importance on both sides of the Border, as has been stated.  There are many moving parts in achieving progress on this issue.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the development of the Newry southern relief road is proceeding well.  This would have a major impact on the robustness of any business case that would subsequently be developed for a vehicular Narrow Water bridge.  It is likely that many of the benefits in the business case that would originally have accrued to a vehicular bridge at Narrow Water will instead flow to the Newry southern relief road.  To that end, a cycling and walking bridge of real architectural merit is worthy of consideration.  This could tie in with the natural beauty of Carlingford Lough and it would link the Newry to Greenore greenway and create the impetus for a greenway on the northern side of the lough from Warrenpoint to Greencastle where greenway users could access the ferry to journey across to Greenore.  This would, perhaps, be worthy of consideration and provide a world-class piece of tourism infrastructure in the region that would bring huge benefits to people on both sides of the Border.<\/p> <p>We have seen the transformation of towns such as Newport in Mayo and Kilmacthomas and Dungarvan in Waterford following the development of greenways.

Section 40 of the Act provides that the Minister for Transport, \"shall have the general superintendence ... of all matters relating to every wrecked or stranded vessel or other wreck.\"  The Act also sets out the responsibilities of other bodies from an operational perspective.  Sections 51 and 52 are of particular note in terms of the duty of the owner and appropriate authorities.  Section 51 places the initial responsibility for removing a wreck on the owner of the vessel, stating that, \"the owner of the wreck at the time of its sinking, wrecking, stranding, grounding or abandonment shall as soon as possible raise and remove it or otherwise render it harmless.\"  The Act also provides for a number of appropriate authorities - a harbour authority, a local authority or the Commissioners of Irish Lights - to raise and remove the wreck or otherwise render it harmless if they consider it is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or a threat of harm to the marine environment or related interests, including the health of the public.<\/p> <p>Separate provisions apply regarding the sale of wrecks and the appointed receivers of wrecks.  The Act allows for the receiver of a wreck to sell the vessel where its owner cannot be located.  However, the Senator will appreciate that a scenario may arise wherein a vessel in such a condition cannot be sold and holds no significant monetary value and, therefore, its sale is not a viable option.  While the Act allows for the removal of the wreck, it does not contain provisions regarding the costs associated with that removal where the sale of the wreck is not possible and the owners of the vessel cannot be located.<\/p> <p>The Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks 2007 provides a legal basis for the State to remove, or have removed at a ship owner's expense, a wreck that has the potential to affect adversely the safety of lives, goods and property at sea, as well as the marine environment.  Ship owners are obliged to maintain insurance or provide other financial security to cover the costs of wreck removal.  As the Senator stated, primary legislation is required to ratify the convention.  It is intended to progress that legislation as part of the future marine shipping Bill.  However, it must be noted that the convention does not cover all wreck removal scenarios.  For example, when the owner of a vessel cannot be located and insurance details cannot be found, pursuing the owner for costs is very difficult.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Senator may be interested to hear that on foot of a recommendation in a recent report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board on the grounding of a wreck on the Irish coast in 2020, the Department of Transport has established a working group to explore the risks and potential costs to the State presented by derelict ships entering Irish territorial waters and coming ashore in Ireland and make proposals for means to identify, monitor, track and interdict derelict ships before they endanger other ships and seafarers in the vicinity.  <\/p><p>Incidence of wreaks coming ashore on the Irish coast are rare.

It is the role of the appropriate authority, in this case Cork County Council, which has taken a number of steps to discharge its responsibilities under the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 by removing stores, including fuels and lubricants, from the vessel and engaging consultants to carry out a number of reports on the vessel.These included reports on the wreck compiled by a marine surveyor, an environmental and ecological impact study and an assessment of hazardous material, but I take on board the points made regarding the Nairobi convention, which will require a specific item of legislation for its enactment.

Like others, I fully understand Aer Lingus is in a perilous situation financially, having lost &euro;360 million last year and &euro;100 million to date this year.  However, this undermining of its commitment to Shannon is a further deterioration in the status of Shannon Airport.<\/p> <p>I would point to the decision on the Shannon stopover in the early 1990s, the sale of Aer Lingus and the controversy over the Heathrow slots.  Shannon, which is and has the status of an international airport with a fantastic terminal building has been continuously completely undermined.  As an island national, connectivity is extremely important.  In light of Brexit and that we will be in a post-pandemic era, we will have to battle for our economic survival and development.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need proper, effective connectivity in order for the mid-west to flourish.  There are many foreign direct investment companies based in the mid-west, particularly in the Shannon Free Zone and the surrounding area, that very much rely on an Aer Lingus presence, and particularly on connectivity between and Heathrow daily.<\/p><p>The announcement by Aer Lingus last week that it was going to close its base certainly does not augur well for the airline's commitment to Shannon.  Without a base, one has to assume that we will not have early-morning flights to Heathrow whereby people who wish to do business in the City of London can fly there, do a day's business and come back that night.  People who wish to fly to London and take connecting flights to other parts of Europe, to Asia and to the rest of the world will not have the option of early-morning flights.<\/p><p>Through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, Aer Lingus has already received a loan of &euro;75 million.  I understand it is in the process of drawing down a further &euro;75 million.  This will amount to a loan of &euro;150 million from the fund.  I also understand that Aer Lingus is in negotiations with the Government regarding a &euro;150 million bailout in order for it to survive.  The company must survive.  It is critical from an Irish perspective and to secure connectivity.  If, however, we are to write the cheque, it cannot be a blank cheque.  We need commitments.  First, we need a long-term commitment from Aer Lingus that it will keep the Heathrow slots to create and maintain connectivity between Shannon and Heathrow.  Second, we need a commitment from the airline that it will continue the flights to Heathrow and continue its transatlantic services to connect the mid-west region to North America.  This connectivity has been critical to the foreign direct investors based in the mid-west and doing business in Shannon.  It is also important from a tourism perspective.  The whole mid-west benefits enormously from American visitors, particularly those from North America but also those from the rest of America.  They spend billions of euros in the mid-west every year.  This is critical.  Aer Lingus will have to guarantee it in the long term if it gets the bailout.  Third, and equally important, the airline will have to be persuaded to reverse its decision to close its base in Shannon.

I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the ongoing crisis in the aviation sector, particularly the recent announcement made by Aer Lingus concerning certain cost-cutting measures in light of the cumulative impact of Covid-19 over the past 15 months.  First, I acknowledge the unprecedented challenges faced by Aer Lingus and its staff during this difficult time.  The entire aviation sector is experiencing its most challenging crisis in its history.  Analysis undertaken last week by EUROCONTROL, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation, suggests air traffic across Europe is not expected to return to 2019 levels before 2025.  Here in Ireland, the sector has been particularly impacted by Covid-19 and Irish airlines continue to face major financial challenges.  As a consequence, all airlines have previously issued capital, raised further borrowings, drawn on Government supports and undertaken measures to reduce their cost base.<\/p> <p>In that context and in light of the continuing pandemic, it is acknowledged that Aer Lingus has little option but to take unpalatable measures to reduce its cost base.   It has also noted that many other European airlines are also implementing significant cost-saving measures in light of the circumstances currently facing the industry.  Nevertheless, it is regrettable that Aer Lingus has decided to close its cabin crew base at Shannon Airport and to temporarily close its base at Cork Airport, as well as embark on a review of grounding-handling arrangements at those airports.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, met the CEO of Aer Lingus to discuss details of the announcement made by the company last week.

In that regard, the Minister welcomed confirmation by the CEO that there is no strategic attempt to reduce connectivity at either Cork or Shannon, while acknowledging that restoration of services depends on market circumstances.<\/p><p>The Minister and Minister of State also met with the CEO of Shannon Group and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, met with the CEO of Cork Airport last week to discuss the situation.  The Minister and Minister of State reiterated their support for the airports and their important role in regional development.

This subgroup has been investigating the option of a specially extended wage subsidy scheme for the aviation sector and this work will continue.<\/p><p>I assure the House that Government is committed to supporting the aviation sector.  We recognise the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of supports beyond the end of June.  Throughout this pandemic, Government has provided a significant level of general support to the economy, with at least &euro;300 million provided to the aviation sector alone.  The bulk of this support is in the form of wage subsidies which were designed to maintain the link between employers and their workers.<\/p><p>Approximately &euro;32 million is also being provided in supports to Cork and Shannon Airports this year.  Additionally, the Department of Transport is assessing applications for funding to State Airports under the &euro;20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme and expects to be able to provide funding to Cork and Shannon Airports under this scheme soon.  This support will allow the airports flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate recovery of lost connectivity this year.<\/p><p>While acknowledging the primacy of the protection of public health, there is clearly an increasing need for a strategy for international travel that can serve as a basis to both protect existing jobs insofar as is possible and to plan for recommencement of operations as soon as is practically possible.  I confirm the Government will set out a pathway for the reopening of international travel following its meeting next Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#M00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

In 2013, the constitutional convention recommended that we reduce the voting age to 16.  The programme for Government negotiated among our three parties had a very clear commitment around ways in which we can look at enhancing the role of young people in society and how we can support youth participation.  One of the specific commitments was that we would look at learning from the Scottish experience where the voting age has been reduced.  It was reduced in 2014 for the Scottish independence referendum but we have seen it maintained for local and Scottish parliamentary elections, including the recent elections.  It was also extended for the Senedd elections in Wales, which took place earlier this month.  The Isle of Man, which was the first territory in the world to extend the right to vote to women in 1881, has allowed those aged 16 to vote since 2006.  The case of Austria is often cited.  It was introduced there for local elections from 2000 and extended to general and other elections from 2007.  Malta has reduced the voting age to 16 and the age is the same in Estonia and a number of German L&auml;nder.  The voting age in Greece is 17.  The Belgian Government has now said that it is going to extend the right to vote to 16 and 17-year-olds for its local and European elections from 2024.  The European Parliament and the Council of Europe have recommended that we look at voting at 16.<\/p> <p>Over the course of the pandemic, we have seen the contribution young people have made to Irish society in so many ways.  In particular, I am thinking of the role of the Irish Second&ndash;Level Students' Union but it also relates to so many other young people.  We had a very good debate in this House last week about the role that young people have played.  <\/p> <p>It is not the silver bullet.  Other things need to happen as well.  We need a very strong programme of political education right through our education system and beyond.  We need to look at ways in which we can resource Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, youth organisations and volunteers who are engaging with young people, but we must be serious about looking at ways of allowing young people to participate in that most important right, which is the right to vote.  <\/p> <p>There are fears that if we extend the right to vote to those aged 16 and 17, they will vote in a particular direction and for all sorts of crazy candidates.  The evidence is that this is not the case.  The evidence from Austria, where it has been in place for over a decade and a half, is that the younger generations tend to follow the broad patterns of other generations except that the issues are different.  There is often a lot more focus on issues that are of direct concern to young people and the political system and political parties adapt in due course.  <\/p> <p>I have a Bill before this House calling for the change to be introduced for the local and European elections in 2024.  It provides enough time for a lead in to deal with all of the issues and engage in that programme of political education.  The Government is committed to the introduction of a much-needed electoral commission, which is being championed by the Minister of State, but as part of that, I would love to hear him give a commitment in this House that we would move towards a situation where those aged 16 and 17 would have the right to vote in the local and European elections in 2024 because it only requires legislative change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#O00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I am taking this Commitment matter on Bob Dylan's 80th birthday.  The times they are indeed a-changing.  From a political perspective, I very much welcome the Senator bringing this issue to the House because it is really important.  At the outset, it should be noted that the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains a broad range of electoral reforms, including a commitment to establish an independent statutory electoral commission by the end of this year.  The programme also contains an explicit commitment to examine the Scottish experience in reducing the voting age in order to draw conclusions.<\/p> <p>Against this background, in December 2020, the Government approved the drafting of an electoral reform Bill.  The Bill's general scheme has been circulated to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The general scheme, which was circulated to the committee on 8 January 2021, addresses a number of Government commitments, including proposals relating to the establishment of an electoral commission.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As I have stated previously in the House, one of the electoral commission's initial functions will be to conduct research on electoral policies, procedures and administrative practices, with a view to providing advice to the Oireachtas on request, as my Department may be required to do from time to time.  Examining the issues in respect of reducing the voting age is a good example of the type of research that could be carried out by the commission, when it is established, and is something I would very much welcome.<\/p><p>The House may recall that the Convention on the Constitution examined this issue extensively over the course of its debates.  Three ballots took place to inform its proposals on this issue.  In the first ballot, there was a small majority in favour of the proposal that the voting age should be reduced.  In the second ballot, the members were asked to consider whether to reduce the voting age to 17 or to 16 years, with the stronger support for the latter reduction.  A third ballot was also held on whether the voting age should be reduced for some types of elections only, for example, local elections.  The overwhelming view of the convention did not support a reduction in the voting age for specific types of elections only, with 68% of convention members voting against this proposal and just 28% voting in favour of it.  In line with the majority opinion of its members, the convention recommended that a referendum should be held to amend the Constitution to reduce the voting age to 16 years of age for all elections.<\/p><p>Separately, and complementary to this work of the convention, the Citizens' Assembly, in its 2018 report, The Manner in Which Referenda are Held &amp;amp; Fixed Term Parliaments, also recommended, among other things, that the voting age should be lowered to 16 years as a means to increase voter turnout at elections, something we all want to see.  While the assembly voted by 80% in favour of a reduction in the voting age, it did not specify the election or elections to which reduced voting age would apply, although it did refer briefly to the deliberations of the Convention on the Constitution on this matter.<\/p><p>The Senator can rest assured that my Department is committed to having this important issue examined.  The establishment of an electoral commission is currently a multifaceted project in my Department's key electoral reform priorities.  Following its establishment, the electoral commission will be well-placed, if requested, to examine, among other matters, the prospect of reducing the age at which a person should be entitled to vote, having particular regard to the experience in Scotland, as well as in other countries that the Senator has referenced, where a reduction in the voting age has taken place.

He will be aware, of course, that one of the verses opens with the line, \"Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call\".

This week, starting today, is National Epilepsy Week.  I am acutely aware of the extraordinary health difficulties that face this country, the HSE and the Department of Health with regard to the cyber ransom event, which is appalling and frightening.  I have a duty, as a public representative, to proclaim that I have been diagnosed with this condition.  On 25 October 2019, when I was the Cathaoirleach, I collapsed and had a near death experience.  Thankfully, my wife saw me collapse and go unconscious so I was rushed to St. James's Hospital and survived.<\/p> <p>There are 40,000 people in this country who are known sufferers of epilepsy.  That number is grossly underestimated because many people say the figure is double if truth were known.  There are many myths associated with epilepsy.  Some people say that one is born with it but that is not correct.  Some people say the condition is inherited.  I am the youngest of a long tailed family of 11 and there has been no evidence of any epilepsy in my family.<\/p> <p>I have been in touch with the epilepsy association of Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, which does wonderful advocacy work.  Sometimes there is a myth and stigma attached to what I call a medical condition that should be unravelled.  On the law of averages, one in 80 people suffers from the condition.  As there are 220 members of the Oireachtas, then at least three other Members, apart from myself, should have the condition.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately for me, I walked around with the condition for many years before being diagnosed.  One consultant said that I had sleep apnea, another consultant said that I had transient ischaemic attacks, TIAs, which are mini strokes, and somebody else said that I had global amnesia.  Thankfully, in the end the matter was sorted.  On 21 July 2020, and nine months after my collapse and ending up in St. James's Hospital, I had seven or eighth absence seizures, which are mini episodes.  I did not go unconscious and knew what was happening but I was in a frozen state for 20 seconds.  As a result, neurologist immediately confirmed that I had epilepsy.  Thankfully, since then I am on medication, which is normal enough.  I live a normal life and hope to resume driving on 1 August.  Not being able to drive is a big setback for me as I live in the remote area of Schull, so I must get buses and trains to Dublin and elsewhere.

Every element of our infrastructure is dependent on our planning process.  In the main it is open and transparent and allows for objections and submissions to the supreme authority for appeals, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The duration of some cases and in particular the open-ended nature of the legal challenges to decisions frustrate the process, making infrastructure expensive.  NIMBYism is alive and well.  All this adds to the cost of delivery of many projects, a cost borne by our local authorities and the State and, in the case of housing, a cost that is added to house prices by the eventual developer or a cost that causes a developer to give up and not try on that site again or indeed anywhere else.  Housing, roads, greenways and wastewater schemes can all be subject to the lengthy legal challenges that delay projects which are much needed for development, sustainability, job creation and environmental protection.<\/p> <p>Former Supreme Court judge, Susan Denham, proposes a separate jurisdiction of the High Court for planning and environmental law similar to family law.  This is due to it being a technical issue in nature.  I understand that the programme for Government proposes such a court.  As we continue to grow our economy through capital expenditure, timely decisions and decision-making are necessary and in all our interests.  A legal impasse lasting years benefits nobody except those earning money from it, the legal profession and environmental experts.  Meanwhile, communities are frustrated by delays lasting in some cases years in the provision of key infrastructure for homes.  The south Kerry greenway is a project in point and a test case for greenways across the country.  The old Galway city bypass went through the Irish courts before ending up in the European Court of Justice, which is fine, but the process was inordinately long, with huge delays.  The Apple case in Athenry is another example.  The project did not proceed because Apple said it had had enough due to the delays.  Objectors using the system to frustrate and delay, delay and delay a project is not right or proper.  A yes-no decision in a timely manner is what is needed in this country for all types of projects.<\/p> <p>I therefore call for a debate on the matter of planning delays at an early juncture in the context of the progress on the proposals in the programme for Government on the numerous examples we have around the country of projects being delayed, predominantly because of the open-ended nature of the appeals process through our courts and the European courts as well.  Planning is hugely important.  As I said, it allows all projects to proceed.  Thankfully, we have a robust planning system but we need a timely and efficient one as well for the reasons I outlined earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#V00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, for speaking out today.

As the Deputy Leader has worn the uniform with pride herself, she will understand where I am coming from here today.<\/p><p>The Government does not have time for the Commission on the Defence Forces to report.  Too many people are leaving right now.  We have seen in the case of the Air Corps that once brought in, an initiative can have a dramatic effect on retention if it is implemented quickly.  We need to start an implementation process right across the Defence Forces or there will be nobody left.  PDFORRA has constantly asked for membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The Minister has said \"No\" and that he favours a commission on pay instead.  Unless that commission can go outside the terms of national pay agreements agreed with ICTU, we are simply going nowhere.<\/p><p>Finally, those of us in politics, in uniform and in the Civil Service who have overseen the decline and destruction of the Defence Forces need to hang our heads in shame.

The first one is the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the problem that some local authority members are having in going about their day-to-day business in trying to help as many of their own constituents as they can.  I am aware that this issue has also been affecting the work that many of us are trying to carry out in this House on a daily basis, which is the need for compliance with section 40 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  In my local authority, a form must now be signed by the person on whose behalf one is making the representation and countersigned by the local authority member.  Simply put, the local authority will not deal with the member unless this form is signed.  The problem, of course, is that we are in the middle of a pandemic and getting such forms signed is difficult, to say the least, for so many public representatives.  <\/p><p>A bigger issue is that the need for such forms differs all over the country, even though all of our public representatives, including Members of this House, are trying to achieve the very best for the persons we are representing.  It was always my understanding that we, as public representatives, must ensure that we keep the data that is provided to us safely and only use them for the purposes of making the representation.  We must standardise this requirement to ensure that all of our public representatives can do their jobs on a daily basis.  We all know that in dealing with various Departments, one must have a level of personal information in order to make a representation but calling to houses to have forms filled in is putting an additional step into a process that is not needed.  I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to the House to discuss this matter.<\/p><p>I thank the Deputy Leader and the Leader of the House for facilitating the important debate this House had on the terrible and totally unacceptable events in Palestine with the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week.  However, to facilitate that much-needed debate, we had to postpone our statements on the Defence Forces.  I join with my colleagues in asking a number of questions on the Defence Forces, given, as my colleague has said, what we have learned over the weekend about the Naval Service and Tadhg McCarthy in the report in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, where senior naval officers are quoted as stating &quot;the concerning and continuing fall in [personnel] numbers&quot; in the service is &quot;hampering best efforts to provide the expected level of service to key stakeholders, and indeed the State&quot;.  I ask the Deputy Leader to convene the debate with the Minister for Defence as urgently as she can.  Numbers are falling in all parts of the Defence Forces and this cannot continue.  We have seen the key role that the Defence Forces are playing and can play in the recent cyberattack on this country but if the recruitment and retention crisis continues, then there is a growing fear that the Defence Forces will no longer be able to carry out many of the vital and underestimated tasks they undertake.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a pay and condition crisis in the Defence Forces.

I have spoken many times in this House on how the financial eligibility test was causing huge distress to families and how they were being asked personal information down to the type of car they drove.  The signing of the regulation has lifted that distress and the families can now focus on getting justice for their loved ones.  However, it was deeply disappointing to see that the regulation is so narrowly defined that it precludes any other families who might find themselves in similar circumstances.  It is clear that when the Civil Legal Aid Act was drafted in 1995, the Minister at the time accepted that there may be incidences where a case is in the broader public interest and there should be scope for waiving the financial criteria.  For more than 25 years this intention in the Act has never been given effect and on news of the regulation being signed last week, I was contacted by a number of families who have been denied civil legal aid at inquests.  They wanted to know if the regulation would apply to them.  Imagine their disappointment when I had to inform them that it would not, that the income threshold for accessing civil legal aid remains so low, combined with the fact that the housing assistance payment is counted as income, it effectively excludes most people from qualifying for civil legal aid.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I believe the State is in contravention of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as the failure to enact a financial waiver for civil legal aid is, effectively, denying people the right of access to the courts.

Also of concern in the survey is that even when the products are provided for free, women and girls in many cases have to ask an employee for them.  Surely it is not too much to ask that products just be available as needed.  I hope we can get a statement from the Minister on how he intends to ensure that direct provision centres follow up on the instructions he gave to direct provision centres, which we all welcomed.  He might also outline how he intends to safeguard against direct provision centres that invoice the Department for products but are potentially still charging residents through the points system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#X00300","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I commend Senator O'Donovan on highlighting the issue he raised.  I have a family member in his position, so I understand the devastating impact of the condition.<\/p> <p>On Wednesday last, I attended a powerful Oireachtas briefing with Relatives for Justice on the tragic killing of two schoolboys, Gavin McShane and Shane McArdle, in 1994.  They were murdered by an unmasked gunman while they played a video game in an arcade.  The young boys were targeted because they were in an area of Armagh city frequented mainly by Catholics.  I was really moved by the contributions made by the members of the McShane family, Alana and Caionn, who bravely and courageously spoke of the nightmarish 27 years since their beloved brother's death.  They said they remain focused on getting justice for Gavin.  I highlight the campaign the McShane family have been carrying out and I seek the solidarity and support of Senators to get the meeting with An Taoiseach that has been requested by Relatives for Justice.<\/p> <p>At the briefing on Wednesday, we also heard from John Finucane MP, who experienced the murder of his father, Pat.  He spoke of the legal knock-on effect of the failure to carry out any meaningful investigation after the deaths of the two boys.  It was shocking.  He stated that the criminal investigation opportunities were limited from the outset due to a failure to collect necessary evidence.  He went on to state that in the case of Gavin's death, it was one family and their supporters against the system, and that the legal arrangements are now in the civil area and are exploring the opportunity for an inquest.  My heart breaks for the McShane family.  Gavin's death is one of many needless tragic murders and we need to do all we can to bring justice to the brave families who seek it.  John spoke of the detailed report on Gavin's and Shane's deaths published by Relatives for Justice in 2019, which highlighted multiple deficiencies in the subsequent Royal Ulster Constabulary murder investigation.  Relatives for Justice would be a very important and viable witness for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  It should be given an opportunity to present the findings of its 2019 report.  It is important that Relatives for Justice secures the solidarity and support of Senators in order to get a meeting with An Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>On the diverting of the aeroplane in Belarus, I fully agree that action must be taken against Belarus.

It is important for the Minister to come into the House to discuss the arts and dance sectors, as well as other sectors covered under her wide portfolio, including the broader tourism and hospitality sectors.  There are a number of issues in that respect, including the representation of members of the hospitality industry on many of the tourism boards.  That needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>Under the current Covid-19 resilience and recovery plan, the guidance for the dance sector is identical to sport, yet all outdoor sport, camps etc. are going ahead.  In response to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister stated that indoor team group sports, including dance and exercise, would be considered in late June.  It is far too late for the summer season to consider that in late June.  Many of these organisations are dependent on summer camps etc. to fund their organisations and keep themselves viable.  I echo Senator Cummins in asking that the Minister would come into the House and give an earlier decision as to when indoor camps can go ahead.  The issue also arises with respect to swimming.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, could perhaps address both areas.  Swimming is another major issue and no commitments have been given with respect to swimming camps or lessons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#CC00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I echo the words of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and thank him for his remarks.

I encourage them to enjoy it but to do so safely and in line with the continued guidance and advice.  In that spirit, and I certainly do not want to get into any mud-slinging because it does not warrant it, but I am concerned about remarks from the Minister of Health in the North about the failure to get a response from the Minister here, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, regarding a meeting he sought more than two weeks ago in terms of strategising, all-island engagement and joined-up messaging.  We are at a point where we are moving ahead, thankfully, but we are at different junctures, North and South, in terms of vaccine roll-out and the lifting of restrictions.  It is crucial now, more than ever, that Ministers, North and South, are effectively joined at the hip to ensure the steady, navigating out of the current restrictions and difficulties we face.  It is not good enough to hear about this via the airwaves or that our Ministers are communicating via the airwaves.  While official level engagement is welcome and important, we are at a point where both Ministers need to engage regularly and crucially on this important issue as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#CC00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Is mian liom dh&aacute; &aacute;bhar a ard&uacute;.

I ask the Leader to communicate with the Government directly to ensure clarity in the announcement later this week.<\/p><p>The Cathaoirleach will be aware that I have regularly raised the question of Belarus in this House.  Currently, as a result of the actions of the tyrant Lukashenko, over 30,000 people have been detained unlawfully in that country.  This is the equivalent of the population of a town the size of Navan.  Dissent has been crushed.  This weekend, we have seen the hijacking of an EU airline flying between two EU capitals.  A journalist, Mr. Roman Protasevich, has been detained unlawfully.  In addition, his girlfriend, Ms Sofia Sapega, has also been detained, purely for the crime of being his girlfriend.  This is state-sponsored piracy.  I welcome the strong response by the Taoiseach, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs but this is a defining moment for the European Council.  If it does not take strong action, any journalist or anyone who wishes to dissent could be victim to this sort of state-sponsored piracy.  What is going on in Belarus is no longer acceptable.  I ask that some of our MEPs, who have been cowardly enough in the European Parliament to oppose or abstain from agreeing to sanctions against Belarus, be called out because this is about European values.  The actions we now take are at a defining moment for Europe.  I ask that a very strong message be sent from these Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#CC00500","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>It is correct to say we need to take a stand on human rights.  There are human rights issues on several levels in the news today.  We have heard about the human rights violations in Cork, where a young girl has talked about living in an abandoned place that people forgot about.  A member of the Traveller community has spoken about the absolutely unacceptable circumstances in which Travellers are being asked to live in Ireland.  When I hear about Gaza, I worry that it might again become a place that people forget about.  While there is a ceasefire, the death is continuing.  The coronavirus testing laboratory was bombed and the head of medicine was killed so we will see the consequences rolling on.  We have seen the effects of the policies of eviction and annexation, which still must be challenged.<\/p> <p>I add my voice to the condemnation of the appalling state-sponsored hijacking and piracy involving an attack on a journalist.  Sadly, across the world journalists are increasingly becoming front-line defenders.  It is unacceptable.  Sanctions should be issued.  I note that we have a record of issuing sanctions in some cases.  Regarding Russia, sanctions related to occupied Crimea and goods from there were found last year by the European Court of Justice to be legal within our trade law, under the Rosneft ruling, because it was found that it is a matter of public policy when human rights are being violated.  I still have not heard an explanation as to why the occupied territories in Palestine are different from occupied Crimea and why the same principle of public policy and human rights does not apply.  I need to hear that rationale because we have not heard it.  I ask that action be taken.<\/p> <p>Let me refer to an area where there is no ambiguity on trade policy.  We can choose to suspend intellectual property profits for a period to allow global access to vaccines.  I welcome the European Parliament's vote for a waiver of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS.

Stress levels are heightened by the fact that some people may not want their employer to be aware of the sensitive nature of their information.  No one should be disadvantaged from illegally obtained information.  There should be a mechanism put in place to protect citizens.  This would deter those in the black market and the vulnerable people from deliberately succumbing to the black market for fear that their employer may hear something about them that was utterly sensitive, private and confidential heretofore.  I will bring this matter up with the justice committee but one way of stamping out the black market is if we can put protections in place for affected citizens.  If it is proven that an employer found out information solely and exclusively through illegal means, they ought not be able to use it to move against a vulnerable employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#DD00300","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I applaud Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for having spoken about epilepsy.

If one looks at the sale of those slots in 2016, one can see that Oman Air bought one early slot from Kenya Airlines for $75 million.  That is one slot.  We have 23.

Senator O'Donovan kicked off with a very personal story of his diagnosis of epilepsy and his journey to reach the point he is at today.  I congratulate him for speaking so eloquently about a really important issue.  I have no doubt that his words will help many others.  He raised additional awareness of the condition today at the beginning of National Epilepsy Week.<\/p> <p>I note that Senator McGreehan raised a similar issue.  Certainly consideration should be given to the issues raised by that particular organisation, that is, free travel.  Given what Senator O'Donovan said this morning, the impact of losing one's licence, particularly somebody living in a remote rural area, is very significant.  <\/p> <p>Senator Kyne raised the issue of planning delays.  Deputy Cowen has brought a piece of legislation before the D&aacute;il on that issue.  It is a problem affecting many communities.  Senator Kyne outlined many of the planning issues across the country.  He touched on Athenry as well.  We all agree that people have a right to engage in the planning process and raise concerns and objections.  However, where this stymies development and impacts a huge community because one person has an issue with it, it is a problem that needs to be rectified.  A debate on this issue would be worthwhile.  <\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell congratulated Major General Maureen O'Brien on her appointment as military adviser to the Secretary General of the UN.  On behalf of the House, I extend my congratulations to her for reaching such a high-level position and representing her country and the Defence Forces with distinction.  I wish her well in that role.  Seeing her reach those heights is fantastic in terms of being a role model for women across the country.  It is no mean feat to get to that position.  <\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell also raised the issue of the ongoing difficulties in the Defence Forces, as did Senator Wall.  It has been accepted that our Naval Service has gone beyond being fully operational.  The smoke and daggers exercise that has been going on for the past number of years to try to pretend that it is fully operational has passed.  It is fully on show for all to see.  Our maritime interests are significant.  We are an island nation.  The need to protect our seas is really important in respect of so many aspects of the country but we do not put the resources into our Defence Forces that we need to.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of retention of personnel.  We are at a stage where the brain drain is so significant.  We have lost immensely qualified and experienced personnel and it will take years to build up that level of expertise in the Defence Forces.  We cannot simply hire people with these skills from the private sector.  We must grow that experience and expertise within the organisation organically, which are then passed down through the ranks and generations as they come through.  We have lost some of our best people and it will take us years to come back from that.<\/p> <p>The work of rebuilding our organisation needs to start now.  With the recent cyberattacks, we have seen that the Defence Forces is the first place we go to so we expect it to perform to the best of its abilities as if it is being fully resourced and supported when it is not.  Far from having a lean organisation, which is what was attempted, we have starved the Defence Forces of resources and it is now a skeleton organisation.  We cannot expect it to do what the country needs it to do without it being properly resourced.  I hope the Department will take note of the challenges that have arisen, particularly from the cyberattack on the HSE, and how much our country relies on our Defence Forces at a time of need.  <\/p> <p>Senator Wall raised the issue of the GDPR and the impact on elected members at local authority level.  I had a quick look at section 40 of the Data Protection Act.  It does not specifically require written consent from the constituent.  It does require consent so I suggest that it might be a good Commencement matter in respect of which the line Minister could provide clarity because as elected Members of the Oireachtas, we do not require written consent from constituents to act on their behalf.  I see no reason counsellors should be treated any differently.  Uniformity of approach across all local authorities is something we should be demanding rather than merely asking for.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the issue of Belarus, as did Senators Black and Malcolm Byrne.  I join with all of my colleagues in utterly condemning that act of aggression towards the European Union.  It is remarkable and almost unbelievable that an EU airline - an Irish airline - would have a demand that its aeroplane land while going between two European countries, with over 170 passengers from 12 different member states on board.  A journalist was kidnapped from that plane and is now in detention.  We do not know his current status or his state of well-being.  I hope that he is okay, and his girlfriend Sofia as well.<br\/><br\/>I echo the calls from everybody in this House that the EU Council needs to act decisively this evening and needs to show its teeth, because it will be a toothless organisation if it allows this type of behaviour.  It must not go unpunished.  The comments of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs have been extremely strong in this regard and in demanding EU solidarity.  I know a number of our MEPs, although not all, as Senator Malcolm Byrne pointed out, have been very strong in calling for decisive action from the European Union and calling for solidarity from all member states to support significant sanctions against the Lukashenko regime.  It is long overdue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also raised the issue of maternity services.  As she knows, it is an issue close to my heart and I am in ongoing consultation with women across the country.  Even as recently as yesterday, a woman contacted me who is attending at Mayo University Hospital in Castlebar and she has been told she will not have her partner with her until the very late stages of labour.  There is the ongoing issue around what constitutes labour and at what point the partner is permitted.  It is something we are going to have to continuously raise in this House until the matter is resolved.  We have to let the women of Ireland know they are being listened to, that their representatives are working on their behalf to get this issue resolved and that we care about the distress and trauma that it is bringing on them, their families and their babies as well.<br\/><br\/>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also raised the issue of the school bus scheme.  I am not fully <i>au fait <\/i>with that issue but I gather from what she says that if, for example, people choose to go to an Educate Together school and it is further than the closest primary school, they are not being facilitated.  That is wrong.  It is a matter that must be raised with the Minister for Education.  I will bring that to her attention and to the attention of the Minister for Transport.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boylan raised the issue of the Stardust inquest and of the Minister for Justice signing the regulations.  The Senator has been strong on this issue and she has raised it many times.  It is only right and proper that the regulations have been signed.  I take on board the comments she made in regard to civil legal aid.  The income threshold is very low and in this circumstance, which is quite exceptional, something should be done for the families of victims so they can access justice and participate in the process.  Otherwise, what is the point?<br\/><br\/>Senator Black brought to the floor of the House the murder of Gavin McShane and Shane McArdle, and I thank her for that.  To be told that the evidence gathering at the time was not sufficient to allow a proper investigation is very difficult for the families.  There are questions to be answered.  My condolences to the families on what has been a very long and difficult journey for them.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of adult medical cards in regard to dental treatment.  If dentists are leaving the scheme because it is not financially viable, that needs to be addressed.  We have come a long way in this country in regard to oral health.  We now realise it is part of physical health whereas, heretofore, we perhaps had not placed as much value on that.  Everyone should have access to basic dental care and that is something we would all agree with.<br\/><br\/>Senator Cummins raised the issue of the performing arts sector.  He made the very important point that while we have placed a far greater emphasis on getting children back to sport, not every child plays sport, but they may do arts, drama or music and that is equally as valuable to a young person as sport.  Perhaps our priorities have not been quite balanced in that regard.  I will bring those remarks back to the Minister.  Senator Carrigy raised a similar issue.  It was also pointed out that those sectors have been in an extremely challenging position.  I commend Senator Malcolm Byrne for consistently, almost on a weekly basis, raising the issue of the arts sector, which has often been left at the back of the queue when it comes to getting clarity as to when the sector will reopen.  I know the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is working hard on that issue.  We will seek a debate with her, given several Members have requested that she come before the House to discuss the reopening of the arts sector.<br\/><br\/>Senator Keogan raised the issue of mental health and brought to the floor of the House the really tragic case of the McGinley family, in particular Conor, Darragh and Carla.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Their father has rightly raised the issue around mental health services.

The Senator used the expression that the Government was butchering 4,000 jobs.  I remind the Senator that in March of this year, only two months ago, she stood on the floor of the House in a health debate and questioned why the United Kingdom was not on the mandatory hotel quarantine list.  The Senator went on to say that all non-essential travel should be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine.  The Senator seems to have changed position somewhat on that particular issue in a short space of time, and not for the first time either.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy raised the issue of the Office of Public Works works taking place in Roscommon.  I commend the Senator on his work on this issue.  I know flooding is a significant issue in his community and the Senator has legislation coming forward on the issue.  I know personally how hard the Senator has being working on the issue not only during this term but during the previous term as well.  It is great to see some movement on that.  I note the issue raised by Senator Murphy around water levels and the loss of bird life and farming land.  That is a significant issue and it should be raised directly with the ESB.  The water levels must be addressed in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Currie raised the issue of the wedding industry.  It has come up on many fronts as it is an industry that employs many people across multiple sectors.  The Senator was right to point out that it does not really come under any particular heading, whether tourism, hospitality or business.  It touches somewhat on all those sectors.<\/p><p>There is also a real human impact on the many couples who are waiting to tie the knot and who have planned a certain day but may not get the day they have planned.  That is not to be under-estimated.  There is a call to give greater clarity and support to people working in the industry and those couples who want to make those important plans within their families.<\/p><p>Senator Moynihan raised the issue of an outdoor summer in Dublin and how we should have been told to be outdoors at Christmas.  I am unsure whether that might have been as feasible as suggested in Ireland.  Certainly, the Government is working hard to provide assistance to businesses that are reopening.  There are multiple grants in place, including grants for outdoor seating.  When we come through Dublin city centre we can see the significant works ongoing to put in place additional space for outdoor seating for the hospitality sector.  This has been welcomed by many restaurants in the city.  Work is under way.  We look forward to having a busy summer socialising together outdoors, if it has to be that way.  That is fine and we will do our best on that front.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the lifting of the restrictions on Northern Ireland.  I wish everyone who is reopening in the North the best.

I do not know the ins and outs of that particular correspondence.  I have no doubt the Minister is probably up to his eyes with the cyberattack but that the meeting will happen at the earliest opportunity.  The Senator is right to bring it to the floor of the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of Belarus as well as the theatre, arts and hospitality sectors.  The comments of Senator Byrne relating to Belarus were strong and we all share the sentiments raised.  The question of 30,000 people being detained needs to be addressed.  We cannot simply brush it under the carpet or express outrage every few weeks and then move on to the next topic.  I hope that the events of yesterday and the meeting this evening will mark the start of real change in tackling this issue and standing with the people of Belarus to deal with it.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of human rights on many levels.  Senators Higgins and McGreehan raised the issue of the report from the Children's Ombudsman relating to Traveller accommodation.  It should be a cause for concern for every citizen that any child in this State is living in those conditions.  I listened to the reports this morning about rodent infestation, lack of sanitation and children having increased respiratory and skin difficulties.  We should be ashamed that any child in this State is living in those conditions.  There is an onus on the local authority in the area to do something about it urgently.  I have no doubt those conditions are not isolated and indeed are replicated in many parts of the country.

Earlier Senator Ardagh raised the issue, which she has done for quite a number of weeks, of rapid antigen testing not as the only means but one of the ways to open up the aviation sector.  I believe that has merit and cannot see why we are not using antigen tests.  I know that if one gets a negative test it does not mean that one does not have Covid but the test is an extra layer of security and would assist in getting things up and running.  I was unaware of the value of the Heathrow slots, which was an important point to make.  That is the history that our country has in terms of its links to the United Kingdom.  The loss of those routes would cause significant damage to the Irish aviation sector.  There is no doubt that the sector has had a difficult time and many jobs rely on the industry.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh also made an important point about the EU digital certificate that we have signed up to.  It is my understanding that the Government is fully committed to signing up to the certificate and its implementation.  We have a six-week period to implement the scheme.

It would be appropriate and I hope that the Minister of State will indicate that he does intend to produce a report to deal with how these various environmental and social criteria have been integrated.<\/p> <p>I am looking for transparency and information on this because it is one instrument in a suite of stimulus measures as part of recovery and resilience strategies across Europe.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, which I note is not a left-wing think tank but a neutral office, issued a report which points out that Ireland has some of the lowest levels of parliamentary engagement in respect of the financial instruments on recovery and resilience strategies.  In fact, of the four ways that there might be for parliamentary engagement on recovery and resilience strategies, Ireland was one of only seven countries in the 24 which said \"No\" to all four.  We are, therefore, one of only seven countries that have failed to have parliamentary oversight on one of the largest and most important sea changes and moves towards stimulus, investment and recovery.  According to the Parliamentary Budget Office, we may still barely have the option, although the time is tight, to have parliamentary and committee debates on our recovery and resilience funds.  These are all options that other countries have taken up.  That is why I am concerned and it is not sufficient that we simply have 30-minute debates on financial instruments going through with everybody hoping, as I do, that there is a good fallout and that good things happen for SMEs on the back of it but without thought and discussion about how it can be most effectively done and without the insight that parliamentary colleagues on all sides might be able to offer in respect of these issues.<\/p> <p>This loan guarantee scheme is one part of a suite of measures.  I am putting forward this idea to make the point on transparency partly because I am calling for greater transparency and discussion on all of the measures and how they join together with all our other collective goals, for example, those goals identified at European level such as biodiversity, climate, environmental risks, cultural heritage and labour standards.  We are allowed to incorporate these issues.  I understand that they may come in indirectly via the European eligibility certificates and criteria but I feel we can do more here in Ireland and there is an insight that we can give here.

The business was refused by two banks for the schemes.  It appealed it to the Credit Review Office, which found in favour of the business and instructed the banks to provide the loans, yet the banks have still not done so.  That seems to defeat the purpose of our schemes and what we are trying to do here as a Government, which is to provide finance to small and medium enterprises.

That will be part of the just transition funding that we need to consider.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In response to colleagues, I point out that my concern is SMEs.  I include social enterprises in that.  I believe the Government does as well, though I do not know to what extent social enterprises have benefitted from these schemes.<\/p><p>Another concern is that, without the proper scrutiny, too many of these schemes go to the bigger, surer thing rather than the SME or the company that is trying to do something new.  We saw that in Home Building Finance Ireland.  That is why the public wants more scrutiny of these areas.  That was meant to go to small developers, yet &euro;200 million of it went to developers who advanced purchase agreements with investment funds.  We saw the visa dividend scheme, the funding that comes from cash for visas, which is questionable in itself.  More than 20% of the money from that scheme is going to investment funds.  There is a concern about SMEs getting squashed out.<\/p><p>Another concern I have and speak about in my amendments to this Bill is the inclusion of mid-caps.  Why not have this relatively small scheme with &euro;29 million liability and &euro;50 million in total just for SMEs?  Mid-caps, according to the definition on the Department's website, have &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion in assets.  Let us go after the SMEs and maybe even have a scheme specifically for the \"S\" in \"SMEs\", the small businesses and enterprises which have done incredible work at local level and been key to the community.  I agree they have a social and community development role and I worry that we have had numerous schemes which we have underwritten and we have heard from people across the House that, when it comes to the crunch, SMEs are still being denied funding and loans.  These schemes are framed too widely and are not delivering for the core businesses that make up the fabric of the communities and that are on the main streets of towns across Ireland.<\/p><p>I am looking for more thought and engagement, including engagement on all of these schemes with everyone across the Parliament and the Oireachtas.  Will the Department please stop keeping all of this in-house and simply presenting it to us for rubber-stamping?  Can we have more scrutiny of all of these schemes as they come through so insights can be given and we can have more debate?  Specifically, the recovery and resilience strategy certainly needs to come before these Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#PP00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank Members for the lengthy discussion we had last Monday.  My understanding was we had spare slots.  There was plenty of time left.  I certainly did not cut the debate short and I spent all the time here answering everyone's questions, including about credit unions.  There was nobody ducking and diving.  This is very much being scrutinised and I am happy to do it.<\/p> <p>This is similar to debates we had last July and September for very good reason.  We are trying to support SMEs.  As Senator Casey said, SMEs are under an awful lot of pressure and this will get finance to them.  The criteria around size relates to an EU definition of small and medium businesses.  We went through the statistics last week of the companies drawing this or funding like this down.  More than 6,500 have been approved for the credit guarantee at the moment and 4,500 have drawn it down.  They are the companies we are trying to reach. <\/p> <p>My reading of the proposed amendment is to put in stricter criteria which will not, in my view, assist companies who need help today because of Brexit drawdown funding.  I understand the necessity for us to work with all our SME community around the social and environmental agenda, the labour agenda and many others but this relates to borrowings.  They are borrowing and paying it back, with added costs.  This is not the State investing in a company or giving away a grant.  All that has strong criteria.  The criteria used here for our part of the guarantee, the 24%, is the exact same as the European Investment Bank, EIB.  Our national bank criteria are the same as the EIB portion.  It is 56%, 24% and 20% here.  We are facilitating companies with their borrowings to invest in businesses that are active and open today.  Social enterprises are allowed once they show they are impacted by Brexit.  If Senators have concerns about any particular one, I ask them to give us a shout and I am happy to tease it through with them.<\/p> <p>Senator Cummins asked about a company I am not familiar with.  If the Credit Review Office reviews it and says it should be lent to, that normally happens.  I would be happy to look at that case because that is what the Credit Review Office is.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I made the point last week in the House that we did not have the credit guarantees or credit review offices in place quick enough after the last crash.  They came into force in 2013 and they were very beneficial.  I am glad they are in place.  I thank the Houses for their support over the last year in getting these schemes put in place quickly.  They will be monitored.  We will keep an eye on where the funding is going, as currently happens.<\/p><p>Reference was made to Housing Building Finance Ireland, HBFI.  I dealt with a number of small builders who would not have been able to build houses without that funding.  It did what it was meant to do, in most cases.  It is probably at a later stage that companies go off and enter into agreements, leases and so on, not generally when they are drawing down funding.  I am happy to debate the house funding issue, but it is not part of this Bill.  This Bill does not deal with investment properties or houses.  There is a miscommunication around what is needed in housing to make it happen.  We need to have a really long conversation about that, because there is a lot more to the story than some people in this House are trying to make out.<\/p><p>On the point raised by Senator Garvey, the maximum interest rate is 3.75%, but the majority are under 3%.  As I discussed with Senator Ahearn in this House last week, 94% are under 3%.  Credit unions are open to this as well.  I did address the issue last week, but I think the Senator had left the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#QQ00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621848600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, are related.

My concern is around the SME focus.  I understand from engaging around this issue, that it relates to agri-businesses on the Border and so on, but I am concerned still about where the loans will go.  It relates to the point I made earlier about whether our SMEs are getting the loans.  In other words, will small businesses get access to these loans?  I am also concerned that the mid-caps which can access this funding are companies which are based in Ireland or have a branch in Ireland.  My concern - this relates to an area where we have not seen risk analysis - is in regard to the creation of reasonable expectations.  The Minister of State will be aware that in parallel with this debate is the constant conversation about the introduction, potentially, of investor protection mechanisms under which companies may seek compensation in regard to changes in policies, one of the grounds for which is that they have been invited, offered an inducement, given a support or been encouraged to engage in an area of investment.  I sought to have the following addressed, but I do not think it has been included.  How do we ensure that those for whom we are underwriting loans are clear that that should not be considered as constituting a reasonable expectation if, for example, the policy in the area of agri-business or industry in which they are involved changes over the next two, three, five or ten years?  That is my concern and it is part of the general piece which is the lack of risk analysis in regard to the schemes.  I want us to have stimulus schemes and for us to be able to support businesses.  I agree with, and called for, a stimulus support in 2008 when we went for the austerity model of engagement.  We need stimulus, but the risk that we create if we bring in potential investor protection mechanisms, which could allow for suits in regard to compensation where an expectation was created or seen to be created by the State having offered support, is an unnecessary risk.<\/p> <p>Again, one of the problems with the investor protection mechanism and the investor court system, ICS, that is potentially being brought in under the Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, is that they make something good - our support to business - a potential liability for the future.  That is not something that I want to see happen.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->With colleagues on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, I have had correspondence with the Department.

The purpose of the Bill is to extend the period of application of certain emergency provisions that have been critical to the Government's response to the pandemic.  The emergency provisions that are to be extended are in the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Health (Amendment) Act 2020.  As the House knows, certain emergency provisions in all these Acts expire on 9 June next.  The Bill I am presenting to the House today provides that the operation of the emergency provisions concerned in these Acts be extended for an initial period of five months to 9 November next.  Any further extensions are limited to a maximum of three months at a time thereafter and must be approved by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>These legislative provisions are very important for breaking the chains of transmission of Covid-19, protecting public health and life, and protecting critical services, including our health service, education and other priorities.  The Members of this House will know the trajectory of the Covid-19 disease continues to be precarious, and there are still considerable uncertainties regarding what measures may be needed over the course of the rest of this year.  Our response is premised on the need to preserve and protect public health by slowing the spread of the disease, reducing its impact on us and limiting its impact on our society and economy.  The public interest is best served by having the provisions in these Acts available for times when they are required for the protection of public health.<\/p> <p>Vaccinations offer significant protection at an individual and population level but it will be some time yet before there is a sufficient level of the entire population fully vaccinated.  Moreover, while there is emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of available vaccines, information is incomplete regarding the impact these vaccines will have on transmission, the length of vaccine induced immunity and the potential impact variants may have on vaccine effectiveness.  In general, international agencies are continuing to advise a range of non-pharmaceutical measures are used until there is a greater understanding of the role of vaccination on the course of the pandemic.  We have made significant progress in suppressing the spread of this virus but we are not out of the woods yet.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I will now outline some key provisions of the Bill in more detail.  The Bill is divided into five sections.  Section 1 amends section 2 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of operation of Part 3 of the Act from 10 June 2021 to the later date of 9 November 2021, or a date specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas under new a subsection (6), to be inserted into section 2.  Subsection (6) provides that each House of the Oireachtas may pass a resolution from time to time to extend the date of operation of Part 3 for a period that does not exceed three months at a time.  The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 inserted sections 31A, 31B and 38A into the Health Act 1947.  Section 31B allows the Minister for Health to make an affected area notice.  The State as a whole has been deemed to be an affected area since 7 April 2020.  Section 31A provides for the making of regulations for preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19 to a region where an affected areas order applies.<\/p><p>Section 2 of the Bill amends section 1 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of operation of Part 5 of the Act along the same terms, with the effect that Part 5 of the Act is extended from 10 June 2021 to 9 November 2021 or the date specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas, with the Houses being able to pass a resolution from time to time extending its operation for a period that does not exceed three months at a time.  The emergency measures in the public interest Act amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to adopt a cascading approach to the role of the independent consultant psychiatrist and the role of mental health tribunals, which review orders involuntarily detaining patients, whereby pre-Covid measures are retained in the Act but, where it is not possible to operate these measures safely, there are provisions in place to ensure the review of detention can continue remotely in the current public health emergency.<\/p><p>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the same amendments and terms of extension for the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Health (Amendment) Act 2020, respectively.<\/p><p>The Health (Amendment) Act 2020 provides for the making of regulations to prescribe penal provisions in the regulations made under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 to be fixed-penalty provisions and dwelling-event provisions.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with statutory enforcement powers in regard to licensed premises and registered clubs to ensure adherence with public health measures on premises where alcohol is sold for consumption on the premises.<\/p><p>In considering whether this Act should continue in operation, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, consulted the Garda Commissioner.  Commissioner Harris advised that if the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 were not extended beyond 9 June 2021, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not have a clear lawful basis for entering a licensed premises to address breaches of the Covid-19 regulations.  Liquor licensing legislation would not provide a power of entry for the specific purpose of addressing breaches of Covid-19 public health regulations.  <\/p><p>I compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its work during this national effort.  It has continued to take a measured approach at all times.  It continues to engage, educate and encourage, and to enforce only as a last resort.<\/p><p>Section 5 of the Bill provides for the Title of the Act as the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2021 and provides that the legislation shall come into operation on 10 June 2021.<\/p><p>As I have said before in the Oireachtas and elsewhere, these powers do not sit easily with me.  However, I believe they have been required up to now to support public health measures and advice and guidance.  The Government wants to lead our return to normality as quickly as possible, but also safely.  We want our society and economy to return to normal functioning as soon as possible but we do not want to have to go backwards.<\/p><p>I welcome this opportunity to provide an overview of the key provisions in the Bill and I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage and to listening to colleagues' contributions during this Second Stage debate.  The Government believes ensuring the continuation of these measures is the responsible thing to do.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#VV00750","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and outlining quite comprehensively the measures contained in the Bill and their necessity.

It was outlined that the powers contained in it were vital to protect the population of this country.  They were vital and we have seen their necessity.  They are serious powers and that is why we are back here.  It is right and proper that we are debating their necessity.  When we passed that Bill originally, I remember there was a great sense of foreboding in the air and people were fearful, distressed and upset.  The mood has changed completely since that day.  I was in Malahide this morning to grab some coffee.  People were out and about, talking to one another.  There was a great sense of joy in the air because things are opening again.  While we look forward to further announcements this Friday, it is necessary that we pass this Bill because, as the Minister has outlined, we are not out of the woods yet; far from it.  We must continue to protect public health, life and our critical services.  I believe the powers contained in this Bill are proportionate.  The Minister has outlined that some will last for five months and others for three months and that we will be back in the House debating whether they are necessary at that point.<\/p><p>I hope we can have a respectful and positive debate today.  I hope colleagues across the House will engage in positive discussion on this Bill.  When we discussed other health measures in the Minister's presence previously, sound bites and hysteria were generated in this Chamber.  Members were trying to get national or local headlines and that was not appropriate, given the seriousness of the situation.  We are all working hard here and must respect one another&rsquo;s motivations.  We must be positive and be leaders, not only in this House, but within our communities.  People have sacrificed an awful lot and will continue to do so but we must not give in to the latest fad, be that to shut down the country, open up the country, let people come in, not let people come in or whatever is floating in a given week.<\/p><p>I know the pressures people are under.  I am talking to them every day.  The aviation industry is hugely important to people in the constituency in which I live.  I have friends, neighbours and colleagues who work in the airport or who work for airlines and they have been devastated by this.  I have every faith that the Minister is doing the best for public health.  We are vaccinating an enormous number of people.  Almost 300,000 people were vaccinated last week, which is incredible.  We all know of friends, family members, neighbours and colleagues who have been vaccinated.  I have not been lucky enough yet to get the call, but I look forward to the day that happens.  The older and more vulnerable people in our communities have received their first and even their second dose.  We are getting there; we are not there yet and these powers are necessary.<\/p><p>I appeal to Senators not to take potshots today or to drum up empty sound bites just to get on to their local radio.  This is too serious and too essential.  We should be leaders who show an example to people how we can all co-operate and speak positively on this matter.  I know Senators have specific issues with this Bill.  Let us engage in a positive manner and not launch personal attacks on anybody.  Let us come out of here with a positive message and provide leadership for the country.  It is what people are calling out for.  I thank the Minister for the leadership he has shown and the tireless work he and the Ministers of State have contributed.<\/p><p>I commend everyone involved in the vaccination schedule, as well as the swabbers at the testing centres.  I had to bring my six-year-old daughter for a test a number of months ago as she was a close contact.

The purpose of this Bill is to extend the emergency provision contained in a number of pieces of emergency legislation enacted at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Without this extension, the emergency provisions would expire on 9 June 2021 and along with them the emergency powers to circumscribe the rights of individuals and impose penal sanctions on them.  This legislation was enacted under the aegis of expedience given the nature of the Covid emergency.  Since then, there have been consistent calls for an in-depth examination of the human rights implications these measures carry.  Has the Government conducted any human rights-proofing analysis?  If not, there must be some extraordinary excusing circumstances to render this analysis impracticable.  The simple fact of the matter is that no such circumstance exists to preclude such an analysis.  The truth is that the Government simply did not bother with human rights proofing as if it was some unnecessary, insignificant or inconvenient matter.  The result is that this Bill is being hastily passed through the Oireachtas with mere lip service paid to the human rights implications it will have - <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.  How often must we be corralled into the same flawed parliamentary process that has distinct and troubling overtones of executive over-reach?  Those on the other side of the House can deny it but their actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric.<\/p><p>The Bill essentially has the effect of allowing for an extension of five months to 9 November 2021 of all emergency provisions and will provide that they may be extended by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas for up to three months at a time.  The open-endedness of this Bill that permits a further three-month extension means that these measures may be permitted by law on a continual and potentially perpetual basis.  This can no longer be said to be a necessary or proportionate response.  To impose such measures where they are not necessary will result in a loss of trust in Government, which is of great importance during a pandemic when such public trust in Government is vital to ensure compliance with the public health advice.<\/p><p>Therefore, I propose that the Bill be amended to extend the emergency powers only until 30 September 2021.  I propose to amend the following sections.  Section 1 should instead provide that Part 3 continue in operation for a period beginning on 10 June 2021 to the end of 30 September 2021.  While I recognise that the enactment of legislation to allow for these emergency powers was in the past arguably necessary, I can no longer accept an extension beyond 30 September.  The extension of these powers in the absence of a robust analysis and compelling evidence to the contrary is not demonstrably necessary and by virtue of that, disproportionate.  Therefore, I philosophically object to the continuation of the harshest and longest Covid-19 measures across Europe and the curtailing of the fundamental rights of the citizen.  Article 28 of the Constitution of Ireland only permits limitation on individual rights in times of war and armed rebellion.  There is no express provision for limitations to be placed in times of public health emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the absence of any express constitutional permission, legislation restricting the rights of the individual is subject to a requirement of necessity and proportionality, as laid down by the courts in Heaney <i>v.<\/i>Ireland.  Under Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the measures limiting human rights must come within a permitted timeframe of human rights law.  Under this framework, the Government is required to take measures only when they are necessary.  Each measure that restricts or limits a right must then satisfy a test of proportionality.  In a democratic society, the restriction must be necessary to meet a pressing need and must be proportionate to a legitimate aim to be achieved.  The aim here is the prevention of the spread of Covid-19 within the community thereby preserving public health.  As it is required by such obligations under international law and the decisions of the Irish courts, a further restriction on individual rights through this proposed extension is subject to a requirement of proportionality.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I submit that this proposed extension can no longer be satisfied.<\/p><p>I also want to raise the issue of the rollout of the vaccines in pharmacies.

Time will tell.  It has been challenging and difficult, and nobody has got everything right, but, by and large, everything that could be done has been done.  In the fullness of time, we will have a review of all of the measures.  There will be a set of learnings and that set of learnings will influence how we do things in future pandemics.<\/p> <p>I want to make clear that this country has performed very well when we look at other countries.  Sadly, too many people have lost their lives, but many more would have lost their lives had we not taken the measures we took.  It is with a heavy heart, and I am sure the Minister shares my view, that we come before this House having to renew these emergency measures.  It is not something that any Government wants to do, not something any Minister wants to propose and not something any Oireachtas wants to pass.  Unfortunately, however, in order to protect human life, to protect our citizens and to ensure the most vulnerable are protected as much as possible, it is necessary. <\/p> <p>Nobody foresaw that this pandemic was going to last as long as it has lasted but that is the reality.  There have been very many variants, including the UK variant that caused the deadly third wave in January, and we now have the Indian variant, which was very well described by Tony Holohan as being a black cloud on the horizon of a blue sky.  We need to acknowledge when things have been got right, and things have been got right.<\/p> <p>I am delighted that I will be going back to County Clare on Wednesday to get the vaccine.  I registered on the portal on Friday of last week, when the turn for my age arrived, and I got a text yesterday.  A turnaround of two or three days is pretty remarkable.  Some 300,000 vaccines were administered last week, so the commitment of 250,000 a week for the month of May has certainly been achieved and surpassed.<\/p> <p>I commend all GP practices throughout the country.  They administered the vaccines with huge efficiency and with great empathy, and put hope and joy into people's arms.  It was great to get the feedback and to hear the stories of people going to their GP to get their vaccinations.  The GPs played a very important role in the administration of the Covid-19 vaccine, as have the amazing men and women who work in the vaccine centres throughout the country, who have done phenomenal work as well.<\/p> <p>It has been said and it is the case that the vaccine is the only way out of this pandemic.  However, it is important to reiterate also the public health advice on the simple things like, where possible, working from home, keeping one's distance and staying 2 m apart, and observing hand washing and the various hygiene measures.  I suggest that some of those measures, in particular in regard to sanitising stations and so on, are here to stay because it is good public health practice.  I would like to see public buildings, supermarkets, hotels and so on continuing to provide sanitation stations for people to sanitise their hands when we return to normal.  Certainly, one of the learnings from this pandemic is that sanitising hands reduces the spread of infection.<\/p> <p>We have all seen the benefits of working from home.  Having people work remotely has played an important part in suburban areas of the cities but particularly in rural towns.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a man I meet in Lahinch every morning as he gets a newspaper and a scone.

I will begin by saying something about the vaccine roll-out.  I am starting to hear of more and more friends and family getting their calls to get a first jab.  Some are getting a second jab.  There is certainly a sense of buoyancy about the place.  People have more pep in their step.  My vaccine seems a million miles away but I am sure it will come.  When I was hobbling through town today, I saw more light in the air literally and metaphorically.  It has to be commended that people are feeling a little more optimistic.<\/p> <p>I will outline some concerns with the process of the Bill.  The measures have been extended to 9 November.  There has been a question as to why it could not have been extended until September.  There are proposals for 80% of the adult population to be vaccinated by June.  International travel may resume in August.  In the context of talking about proportionality, it seems to be something of a jump to extend these powers until November.  I can certainly see why September might have seemed more proportionate.  I imagine there will be amendments on that point tomorrow.<\/p> <p>The Minister has said these powers do not sit easily with him.  That is probably an apt description and I do not imagine they sit easily with many people.  The principles of the right to protest, freedom of religion and private and family life are all fundamental.  They are important issues and I would have preferred more rigorous analysis of the proportionality of these regulations and the impact on these three areas.  That certainly would have given the public more confidence that we were not simply steamrolling things through.  It is important to have meaningful debate around these things.  We only have one hour and 45 minutes today.  There will be one hour available tomorrow to try to get through amendments.  As we have been in this state for 15 months, I am unsure whether it is as much of an emergency as it was in March.  Consequently, more time could have been given to this.<\/p> <p>There probably will be an amendment coming on one point.  There should be a hard date set in stone for review before any extension.  A human rights analysis of these restrictions is important.  If we have to go to November, then so be it but what if we are genuinely looking at an extension three months after that?  We do not know how this virus will go.  I hope to goodness that it is on the way out the door.  However, this should not be renewed without vigorous debate and scrutiny.  We need to ensure our rights are respected and that the most basic tenets of our democracy are protected.  I would like to hear a commitment from the Minister for a review of how these laws are being implemented and how often they have had to be implemented in a report or whatever form it may be in order that we have a clear understanding if it appears, heaven forbid, in October that we have to extend the measures for a further three months.  It will be important to get a commitment.  If we are going into October and looking at extending the measures for a further three months, then we will be in a dire state.  There will be provision to extend the measures from time to time without the appropriate clause.  As has been said in the House, I do not believe we will be extending these until the end of time.  I hope we will not be extending them until the end of time but it would be great if we could provide for some sort of implementation or review should we have to go beyond November.  That is important.<\/p> <p>I am somewhat concerned about the time period given for this.  Pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, was waived.  It is disappointing that the pre-legislative scrutiny was waived for such extraordinary legislation.  The Joint Committee on Health has people from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and mental health advocates appearing before it tomorrow.  We could have worked out the timing better to have heard from these representatives, had more time been given to this.

May I extend my heartiest congratulations to him, on the heroic work of the HSE, and the Irish Government, on the incredibly efficient way the vaccination programme is being rolled out.  I got my jab the other day in the Punchestown centre.  The centre had a wonderful atmosphere and there was a stunningly efficient roll out.  I am told that Kildare efficiency is replicated or near replicated throughout the Republic of Ireland and are we not so fortunate?<\/p><p>I must disagree with the Minister in respect of extending the draconian emergency powers all the way to November.  We have been through one of the most challenging times in all our lifetimes and this pandemic has tested everyone.  Initially, it was fear that engulfed us and many feared death as a dangerous virus circulated within communities.  We tuned into a media that was dominated by death and case number statistics.  At the beginning we knew that science struggled to understand and overcome the threat.  We retreated into our homes.  We stayed apart even though it went against the grain of who we are as social creatures.  We kept a stony distance from the people we love.  A series of immensely mentally draining lockdowns sucked the heart out of our nation.  A control culture evolved and we lost basic freedoms to move and socialise.  We have lost people, families have been shattered, businesses have been destroyed and the health service has been stretched like never before.  We must never forget the heroes of the hour: all those on the front line.<\/p><p>Optimism, fellow Senators, has returned and hope has been harnessed by the wonders of scientific genius.  The vaccination programme is instilling even more hope.  Hope is breathing again.  We may soon have much of our old lives back but now we need to renew, reinvigorate and reenergise.  We need to renew our spirit as a people and look forward.  We need to rebuild.  We need to move away from a sense of being controlled to finding our feet again.  We will need to assess what we have been through and learn from it.  We need to move away from draconian restrictions and reclaim our sense of freedom and autonomy.  We must harness hope and let optimism triumph over pessimism.<\/p><p>Optimism and optimists are never afraid of failure.  They keep trying.  Pessimists are governed by a fear of failure.  They prefer to be in control and are always prepared for the worst case scenario.  We have to live again and the last thing that we need is a plan for a future, theoretical curtailing of our basic freedoms.  Let us move on and bask in the glory of success.  Let us plan for doomsday scenarios when we feel them approaching but not in anticipation of them possibly happening.  With an approach like that we allow the possibility of hope to die.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties said about this legislation, particularly about extending the most draconian measures all the way to November:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThis is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation our State has ever seen.  And while most of us accept it was necessary to rush it through in March 2020, June 2021 is a different time.  We have learned lessons and we must apply those lessons in law.  We cannot set a precedent where government can continue to grant itself powers like these without first meaningfully bringing them before the people - via our elected representatives in the Oireachtas. <\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

It is important to give credit where credit is due.  This extension to November, however, will dampen hope.  I ask the Minister to look at it.  The Bill is only on Second Stage.  Is it really necessary to kick these draconian powers all the way to November?  I think that could damage our hope, and I say this in the context of the most successful vaccine roll-out and where we expect to be with the high percentages come November.  I would not mind coming in here in a few months' time, but a <i>carte blanche<\/i>until November?  I know it is only a theoretical button but it is such a frightening button of draconian power to press.

Since we last had this debate, an extreme wave of Covid-19 in January caught people by surprise.  Thanks to the sacrifices made by the public and the valiant efforts of our front-line healthcare workers, we have brought this virus under control.  The vaccine roll-out is, after a rocky start, as people have said, under way.  The cases, though not as low as we would like, are stable.  With the vast majority of older and vulnerable people vaccinated, many ask why we still need these regulations in place.  The third wave taught us that we must be prepared to act quickly and decisively when the virus is resurgent.  There are no guarantees that a fourth wave could not happen.  The recent surge in India reminds us that we must all remain vigilant to mutant variants.  The continued global pandemic - and it remains a pandemic - presents ample opportunity for further mutations.  While there is an epidemic anywhere, especially in large nations such as India which are heavily integrated into the global economy, we all remain at risk.  Despite progress on vaccination programmes the world over, the risk of vaccine-resistant strains grows.  Much of the global south will not be vaccinated until well into 2023.  The State must stand prepared to act decisively to keep mutant strains out and, if they slip through, to clamp down and eliminate them.<\/p><p>This underscores the importance of maintaining and enhancing our mandatory hotel quarantine system.  It is the most important defence in the fight to keep variants of concern at bay.  It is integral to maintaining the very welcome easing of restrictions into the summer months.  We all want this to happen and we all want this relaxation to stay.  We all support the public health measures and interventions which allow us to keep the virus under control but we cannot support this Bill in its current form.  We support the provisions for further extensions, where necessary, of emergency legislation.  The Government must retain the authority to act swiftly in the face of threat, but we cannot support a <i>carte blanche<\/i>for a Minister.  We especially cannot support an unquestionable extension of emergency powers without parliamentary oversight into November of this year.  We will propose a Committee Stage amendment to limit the current extension to 9 July.  As we near that date, the provisions of this Bill would allow the Minister once again to seek the Houses' approval for an extension.  If that is the public health advice, no doubt the House will oblige, but the Minister cannot continue to issue decrees with far-reaching consequences for society, workers and businesses and for the rights of the individual without parliamentary scrutiny and debate.<\/p><p>The last time we had this debate we told the Minister that when he deems it necessary to implement harsh restrictions, it is his and the Government's obligation to seek the approval of the Oireachtas.  It is the sole right of the Oireachtas to legislate and to enforce restrictions on constitutional rights in the interest of the common good.  It is not for the Government, a select and unrepresentative group of these Houses, to make that determination alone.  The level of co-operation with the Opposition seen during the very early stages of the pandemic does not exist today.  The Minister was given extraordinary powers in good faith by Members of this House.  To push the sunset clause out until 9 November is to push it too far.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to return to the House in late June or July to extend the emergency powers once again if necessary and to explain the context in which they are needed.  This has to be part of an overall strategy which people can see and which shows how far we are from exiting from these types of restrictions and the sort of yo-yo situation about which people talk.  We do not see such a clear plan coming from the Government yet.  In the absence of this plan, we have a Government which seeks these powers for a further six months.  That is a step too far for us, not because we do not want restrictions or do not believe public health measures should be implemented but because we believe in scrutiny and accountability.  To that end we will also introduce an amendment which would require a statutory instrument issued under the emergency legislation to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas within two weeks of its issuing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This would give the Minister and Government scope to act swiftly and decisively, where necessary, and to require, as is right, that they explain these actions to the Houses.

We find out that statutory instruments have been introduced when they go up on the website.  Not even the health spokespersons for Opposition parties are given a heads-up.  We get no emails from the Department to say that the Minister is going to publish a statutory instrument which will be available online or to offer us a briefing or clarification on it.<\/p><p>None of that to which I refer happens.  This is not the first time we have said this to the Minister.  I say all of this in good faith to him.  I want this to change.  Transparency is, after all, the Minister's friend.

While the Minister seeks emergency powers in these areas, he needs to co-operate more with his counterpart in the North.  We heard just this morning from the North's Minister, Robin Swann, MLA, that he has been seeking a meeting with our Minister for two weeks.  I am not satisfied that we have got cross-Border testing and tracing right.  There is a significant amount of work to do in that regard.  I thank the Acting Chairperson for her indulgence.  I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity this afternoon to address in public the remarks made by the North's Minister, Robin Swann, this morning.

We are skipping the normal scrutiny of legislation, not having the usual kind of oversight and transferring from the Oireachtas substantial powers to the Minister, powers that a Minister would not normally exercise by statutory instrument.  We have given the Minister the power to do more than he normally would by statutory instrument.  Anyone looking back on the debates will see the then Ministers, Deputies Harris and Coveney, speaking on the sunset clause and how there would be chances for future debates, and that they wanted to allow one extension in order to deal with an emergency scenario but that the extensions would not be infinite.  People have talked about November.  My main concern is that as this Bill is currently worded, these powers could be extended until 2027 because it allows three-monthly renewals by resolution.  Yes, that is the House deciding as a resolution, but it is not the same as pre-legislative scrutiny.  It puts us in the position of all or nothing.  It is as though we cannot talk about the bath water or change it without throwing out the baby.  It is literally saying to us that each time one is for or against emergency powers rather than seeking insight from Members of the Oireachtas as to how the legislation might be improved.  Senators McDowell and Ward, among others, have already pointed out ways in which the legislative drafting could have been improved in these powers.  It is vitally important if the Minister asks us again to skip through the process and hand powers over - this is about trust, the public's trust-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#DDD00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEE00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We spoke about leadership.

Not in our wildest nightmares did we think that we would still be here still discussing it and extending sunset clauses.  I am on the record as saying that the legislation was draconian at the time, and it is still.  No one is happy that our lives are being micromanaged at a very personal level and so many of us are being effected but no one is happy that the coronavirus is taking over all our lives, all over the world and we do not know where it will go.  At one stage last summer we thought it was under control but we never thought we would be in a fourth wave.  With the emergence of new variants and a serious surge in Limerick, we do not know where we will be in a few months.  It is with reluctance that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the legislation and the extension of the sunset clause.  The Minister should take on board Members' remarks about returning to the House and letting us have some sort of input into ways the legislation might be improved.  We have such great talent in the House, it would be remiss not to take the contributions on board.<\/p> <p>I congratulate the Minister on his vaccination programme.  It hit the 300,000 mark last week.  I do not think we ever thought we would get to that.  My mother, the person for whom I had most concern, has been vaccinated and I am glad she has received her second vaccination.  We hear of more and more people getting vaccinated.  It is wonderful and the programme seems to be working.  Saying that, there is more the Minister can do in his position.  Earlier, I said that we need to look more seriously at rolling out antigen testing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On Thursday, the European Parliament passed a proposal on the use of the digital green certificate.  Antigen testing is central to the roll-out of that.  As the Minister will be aware, however, some officials in the Department and the HSE are reluctant to go with antigen testing.  We all know it is not a silver bullet and that it is only 50% effective, but when the rest of Europe is happy to get on board with antigen testing and use it as an efficient too, it is not good enough that we are not doing likewise.<\/p><p>We read in the newspapers at the weekend about the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contacting the HSE with regard to rolling out antigen testing at meat factories.  Over the course of four months, the Department has tried to persuade the HSE to facilitate antigen testing but it has never happened.  The HSE has never given a proper response as to why it is so reluctant in this regard.  Pilots are outside the gates of Leinster House today seeking the rapid roll-out of antigen testing, which is something I support.<\/p><p>I am curious to hear the Minister's take on antigen testing.  Is he, along with his colleagues in Cabinet, committed to the digital green certificate initiative?  What dialogue has he had with his counterpart in the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure this issue will be meaningfully examined?  We are all aware of the draconian powers before the House but, as my colleague stated, we want to be ambitious and to hope for the future.  Part of that hope is about foreign holidays and having a few days in the sun.  People want to be cautious, however, and antigen testing plays an important role in that.<\/p><p>So many of our elderly, including my mother, were so rigid in following the guidelines and stayed at home for the entire period.  Many are still reluctant to leave the house despite having been vaccinated.  As a State, we need to do something to thank our elderly for looking after themselves.  Perhaps there could be an initiative within the Minister's Department to let them know it is safe to be out and about.  I have spoken to people who are so down and do not see a future.  It is really upsetting to hear.  We need to thank our elderly and give them something back, although I do not know how that could be done.  Perhaps a survey could be done on how we could give back to those who looked after us in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEE00700","speaker":"1630","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis as ucht na m&eacute;ide oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta go dt&iacute; seo ar an &aacute;bhar seo, &aacute;bhar at&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach ar fad d&uacute;inn.<\/p> <p>I congratulate the Minister.  From the word go, he has been in a very difficult position and we now see the fruits of the labour in which he has been involved over recent years.  Many Senators mentioned the vaccination programme and there is no doubt it is tremendously important, as I have seen with my parents.  My mother got her second dose on Saturday and the vaccine has transformed their lives.  Vaccination is beginning to reopen society and is working.<\/p> <p>It was in that light that many of us earlier met members of Recover Irish Aviation, the group of pilots who attended outside Leinster House in what was a very impactful and reasonable demonstration and request.  Many of the restrictions that are in place here are no longer in existence in many other countries throughout the European Union or the wider developed world.  Obviously, there are other countries that have severe problems and simply do not have access to vaccines, and that is another day's work.  In countries such as those in the European Union and the United States, however, progress has been made.  Some of the pilots who spoke to me earlier had this morning arrived from New York, which is now behaving normally.<\/p> <p>In the context of the progress we are making here and the different place in which we find ourselves from where we were when these Acts were originally passed, is there space to take a more pragmatic approach to the restrictions that are in place, examining measures such as rapid antigen testing?  One of my sisters had a baby two weeks ago in Switzerland, and my other sister, who lives in London, was able to travel to see her having passed just an antigen test, and no problem has arisen as a result.  That facility, however, is not available to Irish residents who wish to travel outside Ireland, and there is something we can do in that regard.  There is an economic pressure on the aviation sector in particular.   It is the gateway into and out of this country.  As a small island off the coast of Europe, we must continue to engage with aviation and allow it to reopen in the best and safest way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This legislation is technical in essence.  I respect the reason it has been brought to push further out the sunset of 9 June.  However, that date did not come as a surprise.  We knew it was coming.  It was a hard stop in respect of the legislation.  It is somewhat frustrating for us in this House to find ourselves once again in a situation where this legislation comes with very little opportunity for it to be properly scrutinised.<\/p><p>I know the Bill does not do very much except to extend those dates and I accept it is not a great feat of drafting to be able to do that.  However, I have a problem with the fact that when the other Bills were going through this House last year, we identified reasonable problems and genuine issues with the legislation that has put in place many of the restrictions and the powers for garda&iacute;.  I spoke to the Minister afterwards and was under the impression that when we got another Bill on the subject, those issues would be addressed.  In this Bill, they are not addressed and that is a real missed opportunity.  This is not a complex Bill.  There was room in it to fix sections of the amended Health Act 1947 which simply do not work.<\/p><p>I remember standing in this Chamber late on a Friday night last year, pushing through legislation so it would be signed by the President the next morning and be in effect for the weekend.  I understand why the Government wanted to do that.  It is entirely reasonable to have the legislation in place.  However, the legislation was largely dysfunctional, and that view was expressed by many Members of this House.  There was an iron-clad, easy opportunity to fix that in this Bill and it has not been done.  That is the most frustrating thing.  I recognise how much the Minister has done to safeguard us all and that his Department has done to roll out the protections and the solutions in terms of the vaccine programme.  That is progress but with that we also had an opportunity to fix the problems we knew were there.  That is a real missed opportunity.<\/p><p>I do not want to be negative about this.  I think it is necessary.  A Senator referred to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, saying that this is the most draconian legislation in the history of the State and that is probably true.  It is draconian but this is also the greatest health crisis we have faced as a State.  I understand the need for this legislation.  I may not be happy with it, any more than any other citizen who is restricted by it.  While I will support this legislation, I think there is a real missed opportunity to fix some of the lacunae in the Acts that have already become law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#FFF00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I endorse the remarks made around the House on his personal achievements as Minister.  He has not, as Senator Ward said, been there for years.  He has been there for less than a year and during that year he has had a torrid time.  Cowardly keyboard warriors have used anonymity in the most vile campaign of abuse against him and I totally dissociate myself from that.  I compliment those, including our Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Berry, who are doing the jabbing most efficiently and courteously.<\/p><p>I fully endorse what has been said by virtually every speaker in this House.  This should not be coming before the House in these circumstances.  This day has been clear for a long time.  It is not a mystery that the sunset clause was coming today.  This amendment is not just to bring things out to next November.  As Senator Higgins said, it is to put in place the power to indefinitely keep re-extending these powers <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.  It is not a time-limited measure.  When the Houses of the Oireachtas are confronted with the motion to extend, it is a binary &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; with no inquiry as to whether it was good, bad or indifferent, whether the regulations did or did not work well or whether right or wrong things were done.  There is none of that, just vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; and the party whips will see it through.  That is what we are voting for today.<\/p><p>These Houses of the Oireachtas have failed miserably over the last year.  The Oireachtas Commission should not be proud of what it has done.  The fact we are apportioning a couple of hours today and an hour tomorrow to this legislation is a scandal and should be called out for what it is.  There was, before this Government was formed, an all-party D&aacute;il committee chaired by Deputy McNamara.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Its function was to keep the Covid scrutiny issue under control.  It was disbanded and a complete untruth was propagated as to why it was being disbanded, which was that the sectoral committees would deal with the Covid crisis quite adequately and that that was the way to go.  That suits Ministers and, perhaps, the establishment in this House, but it did not happen.  NPHET was never made accountable to that committee; it appeared before it on one occasion or, maybe, two and it was not a pretty sight.  <\/p><p>We now have to understand that it is our duty to insist on accountability and that we cannot just give a licence or a broad blank cheque to the Government to continue as if nothing has happened.  As a Parliament, we have to get our act together too.  It may be politically unpopular, but that involves acknowledging that every Member of this House and his or her staff are vital workers in the democratic process and should get the jab as quickly as possible so that we can resume normal business and have normal scrutiny of parliamentary activity as the Constitution requires.  It requires a little bit of courage to say that that should be done.  I know there are people who will say that that is jumping the queue, but it is not.  Today, the queue has brought us to the point where we are rubber-stamping legislation and giving an open-ended licence to continue to keep these emergency measures in place.  <\/p><p>There are many issues that I would like to address today if I had more time.  I would like to address the announcement by the British Home Secretary, Priti Patel, regarding the new immigration and card entry system into the UK and how that is going to integrate with the Irish common travel area.  I would like to talk about how our relationship with the Schengen travel arrangement is going to function.  There are many issues that we are allowing to go undebated and undiscussed in this House.  I would like to know if this legislation is really necessary and, if there is a third or fourth wave, or a new variant, it is ever sensible to say that intercounty travel should be banned.  Is it ever sensible to do that?  I want Professor Philip Nolan to come before a committee and demonstrate to me that banning intercounty travel and imposing a 5 km route is the way to deal with this issue.  <\/p><p>We should not be doing what we are doing today.  It is wrong and it is weak.  There are no longer leaders and Whips meetings to decide on the business of this House.  That is scandalous.  In the last session, when I and others supported this emergency legislation as first tabled, it was on the basis of a prior discussion as to how much time would be available.  Now, that has disappeared.  I appeal to the Members of this House to make it very clear to the Oireachtas Commission in particular that we want to get back to business.  We do not want this House to be in suspension.  The amendments we tabled on  30 September were to allow this House to come back and function normally and to allow the Government time, if there was a case for an extension, to make it to a fully functioning Oireachtas of both Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#GGG00200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I allowed Senator McDowell some indulgence because I have a lot of sympathy for what he had to say.

It is difficult for the former, because they are seeing people not complying while they are.  That is why regulations such as these are necessary.<\/p><p>Similar to Senator Ward, I met members of Recover Irish Aviation.  I have received communication previously from the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, regarding its industry, which is on its knees across the world.  We understand why that is the case, but it needs a roadmap and the early resumption of travel.  The digital green certificate will be an important game changer in that respect but the industry needs to be able to plan and ensure that its pilots have the required hours of training in advance of that date.  It needs to know when that reopening will take place.<\/p><p>The US is important to us in terms of the economy, our mutual relationship, emigration, and the many visitors from there who come to Ireland annually.  As quickly as possible, we need to consider countries like the US when allowing vaccinated people to enter Ireland.<\/p><p>Together with the pathway towards resuming aviation that the Minister is planning, the digital green certificate will be important.  I hope he will announce the pathway, or its date, after this week's Cabinet meeting.  The industry needs hope and certainty.  Technical issues also arise, for example, pilots requiring a certain amount of training before they can get back into the skies.  We know the importance of the aviation sector to an island nation.  We know the relationships within the European Union, as well as the competition in the EU's aviation sector.  We also know of our particular relationship with the United States - our historic ties, the number of US tourists that visit Ireland annually and the importance of the US to our economy, including Shannon and the regions.  We need to consider the United States in particular in terms of measures that could be put in place to support the resumption of unfettered travel between both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>I have great sympathy for the aviation sector.  We have seen decisions being made somewhat opportunistically, for example, the decision regarding cabin crew services in Shannon.  Why waste a good crisis and all of that?  If we lose services, getting them back will be more difficult.  There would be opportunities for other airlines to come to Ireland, provide routes and see the weaknesses in Aer Lingus or whatever else, but the damage that could be done to our airline industry into the future would be significant.<\/p><p>The pathway will be very important.  Ireland should participate fully in the digital green certificate at the earliest opportunity, be that 1 July, which would be preferable, or the end of July.

Perhaps such debates could be structured in a different way to ensure we get something constructive from them.  Senator McDowell has put his finger on it.  We are here at a crunch time to extend the time limit and we have not said whether we learned anything from the past six or eight months.  We should have learned much from the last few lockdowns.  The Government came to the conclusion people are safer outdoors but it was nearly pushing everybody indoors given that people could not travel beyond 5 km.<\/p><p>I come from a large county which has some of the finest walks in the world but they are miles away from everybody, even within the county.  People could not travel to those areas and one would wonder why.  They would be much healthier in those areas than inside a house.  That is an aspect we should have considered.  Perhaps Senator McDowell was right in what he said about a county lockdown or perhaps a regional lockdown.

On one hand that is an issue but, on the other hand, our tourism industry could suffer greatly.  As has been said on numerous occasions, as an island nation we need air transport and connectivity.  Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and all those countries are opening up but we are not opening up to the same degree.  We must have a plan in the short term, as we need to open up by 1 July, certainly for travel.  We can see most of the hotels in Dublin are closed.  The pilots are adamant that antigen testing could be of great benefit to them and to that industry.  It is being used all over the world but the National Public Health Emergency Team does not seem to have any great confidence in it and one would wonder why.  Many Members of this and the other House have put forward that antigen testing should be used more.  I certainly agree with it, even if it catches only one person.  We have the farcical situation where those in the Department of Health are going to the airport to get antigen testing done.  That is what we have been told but antigen testing cannot be used at the airport.  Those are matters we should discuss in greater detail and at more length because, as Senator McDowell said, this House has failed.  It is not only this Bill but several Bills we have debated in detail.  The debate on the previous Bill was guillotined.

What is being done is phenomenal.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In my community, Tipperary, I note how excited people are after getting fully vaccinated and the freedom they feel on the back of it.  I commend the Minister on that.<\/p><p>As most Members said, no one welcomes this Bill.  It is necessary.  Many referred to the extension of the date but no one envisages that the measures will have to be used in the period in question.  They will be used only if necessary.  With this virus, we do not know where we will be any time soon.  We should bear that in mind.  The virus tears up all our plans every time so having some sort of certainty in this Bill is probably the right thing to do, even though it is impossible to welcome it.<\/p><p>As others said, there are so many sectors under major pressure.  I encourage the Minister to examine the aviation sector as a whole.  The antigen testing route is a genuine game changer for the industry.  It needs to be taken to give people options to open up the industry and travel.  It would make a big difference if we could achieve this, including in respect of Aer Lingus, its routes and challenges.  We heard last week what happened regarding routes from Shannon and Cork.  The routes are exceedingly important and we do not want to lose them.  It is not Aer Lingus which controls the routes; it is International Airlines Group, IAG.  We have 23 routes that are very valuable and we do not want to lose them.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a local, but important, issue concerning the maternity ward in my local hospital, Tipperary University Hospital, Clonmel.  It is still one of a small number of hospitals that are not adhering to the recommendations and guidance of the Minister on partners.  The hospital's view is based on a very short timeframe for labour.  If my wife were asked about this, she would say labour lasted from the minute she walked into the hospital, or lasted for 36 or 37 hours.  It is devastating for partners that they cannot go in.  When other hospitals are allowing it, it is really frustrating that the hospital in Clonmel is not.  I call on the hospital to relax its measures in line with what other hospitals are doing.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#KKK00600","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I respect the need for the Bill and the extension of the dates.  The remarks of Senators McDowell and Burke are to be noted by all of us.<\/p> <p>The vaccination programme is working.  Today, we heard that 300,000 Covid-19 vaccines were administered last week, and that is to be the case again this week.  It is proof that the vaccination programme is working.<\/p> <p>The Minister, in his speech, praised members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I still contend that, even at this late stage, they should be prioritised in the vaccination programme.  They are on the front line dealing with people.

They have no courage; they are nothing but cowards.  At least the Minister has the courage to put his name on a ballot paper, take an oath of office and work.  I commend him on his work.<\/p> <p>Healthcare staff at all levels should be commended.  We praise them for their work.  This morning, many of us spoke to and met members of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association and other representatives of the aviation sector.  Some of us involved in the transport committee have been very much engaged on addressing the need for antigen testing as part of a suite of measures to combat Covid-19.  Equally, with the EU digital Covid certificate, there should now be no excuse for Ireland not to participate, although I know it will, and not to get involved early.  There should be no procrastination over that.  The time for conservatism is over in this regard because if we believe in the science, we should agree that a fully vaccinated person should be able to travel with a negative Covid test and a full vaccine without mandatory hotel quarantine.  If we agree we are European and part of the European community and believe in the EU digital Covid certificate, we should agree that a fully vaccinated person with a negative test should be able to travel and have, to echo the Minister, unimpeded travel access across the EU.  Late July and August are far too late.  It is way too slow, notwithstanding the health concerns over the Indian variant and so on.

I thank colleagues very sincerely for their contributions, ideas and challenges which are essential.  It is fair to say that none of us want this Bill.  This is a deeply unwelcome Bill.  I remember sitting almost exactly where Senator McDowell is right now, when I was debating this Bill with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I described the powers as draconian.  I still think they are draconian.  I think this Bill is draconian.  There is no question about it.  Legislation and powers like this should never sit easily with anyone in a democracy and they should certainly never sit easily in our Republic.  We must handle them with the utmost care and caution.  They do not sit easily with me in my Department.  I doubt they sit easily with any Member of this House or the D&aacute;il, nor should they.<\/p> <p>They are necessary for what will hopefully be a very short period of time, which is why I stand here proposing them and ask the House to support them.  They must be used very carefully.  I have taken notes from, I hope, all speakers.  I may have missed some pieces and I apologise if I have.  There were a number of broad questions, one of which was on the timing and whether 9 November is right.  I think there was a suggestion for the end of June, the start of July, September, November.  I do not think there is a right answer.  There is no correct date.  The date of 9 November is no more correct than a week or two before or after it.  We did check with public health advice in terms of the broad timing of this measure.  How much time do we believe we need given where we are at with the epidemic, the variants, international travel and, critically, the vaccine programme?<\/p> <p>The view from public health advice was that we need to be able to exercise public health measures of the type that are covered here into late autumn-early winter.  Hence the start of November is the time being proposed.  As I have said, it is because of a variety of different factors.  One is to do with what stage we will be at with the vaccines.  Another is the variants.  This week, as Senators will understand, we are looking closely at the Indian variant, what it is doing in the UK and its potential transmission here.  Public health advice pointed out that around that time there will be a mass movement back indoors.  I have no doubt, unless something unforeseen happens, people will be indoors anyway by that stage.  People will be back in restaurants, in pubs and each other&rsquo;s houses.  Indoor life will continue but as we move into early winter, we all move back indoors, and we close the doors.  It is the public health view that late autumn-early winter was around the time when one still might want to be able to exercise these sorts of public health measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->My hope is that we do not have to exercise any of them but if we do, they are lighter touch measures like having to wear masks in particular higher-risk environments or if there are local outbreaks or local outbreaks of variants.  There may be more variants coming or variants the vaccines do not work as well on.  That is the big question.  We are always asking in terms of these variants.  <\/p><p>The second set of comments, questions and challenges was around impact and proportionality, which is a critical question.  The measures we are using are harsh and have caused huge hardship for people.  There has been significant isolation, loneliness and mental health challenges for people.  People have lost their loved ones, friends and family.  Not only have they lost them but we have not been able to grieve properly those whom we have lost.  It has been very difficult for so many people.  I say that as somebody who buried my 102-year-old granny very recently.  It has been brutal for people so why have these?  It is because the other side of the human rights argument is that people have a right to health.  People have a right to be protected from the pandemic.  If we look back to the first roll-out of measures like quarantine and the kind of public health measures that were deployed many years ago to prevent the damage these pandemics or epidemics do, we can see that a human rights argument was used by public health doctors to say that people have a right to be protected and kept safe as well so what we are always trying to do is balance those rights and obligations.  There are no easy answers and I do not think anyone has any monopoly of wisdom on this.  Obviously we have never dealt with anything like this and, please God, we will never have to deal with anything like it again but who knows?  <\/p><p>Have we got everything right?  Of course, not - there is no country or government that has got all of this right but the measures are working.  If we look back from January to March or April, we can see that because of the extraordinary solidarity of the Irish people, Ireland went from having the highest rate to the lowest or one of the lowest in a very short period of time.  We were one of the earliest European countries to open up primary and secondary education to in-school education for everybody.  In spite of our healthcare system and incredible healthcare workers coming under enormous pressure, unlike a lot of other countries, our healthcare system was never overrun.  We never ran out of beds or ventilators.  We treated everybody and our survival rates in ICUs compared with a lot of other highly developed countries are very good.  The measures have worked.  In time, there will be look backs and analysis of how Ireland and other countries did.  Our excess mortality rate is one of the lowest in Europe.  The people who deserve credit for that are certainly not the Government.  It is the Irish people who deserve credit for sticking with the measures but the measures work so while they are hard, at least we do know they have worked and Ireland has fared well relative to a lot of other countries.  That is not to minimise the awful pain and suffering that has occurred but relative to a lot of the rest of the world, Ireland has done relatively well and it is partly because we can deploy these measures and deploy them very quickly when they are needed.  <\/p><p>The Cabinet is meeting on Friday morning to discuss June and whether we can further relax as per what was signalled a month ago and what to do about July and August.  We are entering that conversation in the most positive conceivable setting.  Just a few months ago, when we were talking about the first easing of restrictions, we had analysis and projections that were very sobering indeed.  It seemed very reasonable at the time.  It was a case of \"here's what happens if we have a R number of 1.2, 1.4 or 1.6.  Here's what happens when you open the schools.  The R number will go up.  Here's what happens when you relax travel.\"<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What people have done is they have really backed the measures, taken care of each other and kept each other safe.  We are ahead of the best-case scenario that we were shown at that time.  Again, the credit for that lies with the Irish people but at least we know the measures work.<\/p><p>In terms of parliamentary scrutiny and safeguards, the Bill before the House has a very important provision, which is that the powers can only be extended by agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas due to the sunset clause.  In terms of the sequencing of Seanad time, I had nothing to do with that.  I hope I turn up here regularly enough and if colleagues would like to debate the various issues raised, I am always happy to come in and debate those, listen to the ideas and the challenges and bring them back to Government and try to implement them.<\/p><p>Various measures were mentioned but as I am conscious of time, I will focus on the one that was mentioned most, which was the aviation sector and the digital green certificate.  There will be an announcement, presumably after Cabinet on Friday as it is scheduled to be discussed at Cabinet on Friday.  We are in a good position.  The Government backs the digital green certificate.  Essentially, what that will mean is that people who are fully vaccinated can travel, not only in the EU, but with partner countries outside the EU as well.  That would include no home quarantine.  That is really what people are looking for, namely, unimpeded travel.<\/p><p>The impact analysis of the vaccines is profoundly positive.  I remember talking to very esteemed, very well experienced epidemiologists last August or September, who were telling me they doubted we would have any vaccines of any impact within two or three years, but that maybe within five years we might get a vaccine that would be useful against this, but we might never get one.  They referenced HIV-AIDS and all sorts of other viruses and pandemics that have occurred.  To be in the position we are in now is extraordinary.  One of the things we can do with that is fully support and join up to the digital green certificate and my hope is that will happen as quickly as possible.  That will have a very powerful and positive effect on the aviation sector.  I know the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is engaging directly with the sector and that the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe, are also looking at economic supports because it has been a brutal time for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#MMM00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The Minister might get NIAC and NPHET to agree with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#OOO00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I apologise for going over time.

I thank the Senators for providing me with an opportunity to set out the provisions of the Planning and Development, Heritage and Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2021.  As I set out in the D&aacute;il a number of weeks ago, this technical Bill is necessary to allow for the transfer of functions relating to heritage under a number of enactments to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Normally such transfers of ministerial functions are affected through orders made under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.  A number of powers and functions in respect of heritage have already transferred to the Minister for housing under the Heritage (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2020.  However, two problems arise as to the transfer of the remainder of the functions relating to heritage to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage which must be addressed by this Bill.<\/p> <p>First, section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 prohibits the primary Minister under the Act, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, from exercising any power or control in respect of any particular planning case.  Section 30 must now be amended to provide for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to lawfully exercise certain heritage functions proposed to be transferred from the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media, and in particular, certain functions regarding commenting on planning applications and draft development plans from a heritage perspective.<\/p> <p>Second, the Supreme Court decision in the Mulcreevy case of 2004 holds it to be impermissible to use secondary legislation in the form of the transfer of function orders to merge into one Minister functions of the Oireachtas in primary legislation which the Act had intended to be divided between two separate Ministers, this being seen by the court as breaching a key constitutional principle that only the Oireachtas can make and amend primary legislation.  There are certain legislative provisions relating to heritage in which this problem arises and must be addressed by this Bill.<\/p> <p>If this Bill is enacted and commenced, the remainder of the heritage powers and functions held by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media may be transferred to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage by a transfer of functions order.<\/p> <p>I will give a brief overview of the main areas of legislation to be amended by this Bill.<\/p> <p>Section 4, amendment of section 13 of the Act of 2000, amends section 13(2)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which deals with the adoption by planning authorities of variations to development plans by the substitution of \"to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media\" for \"to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht\" and similarly amends section 13(8)(c) of that Act.<\/p> <p>Section 5 amends section 32 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to allow for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to exercise certain heritage functions transferred or proposed to be transferred to him or her.  Sections 6 amends section 51 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by providing that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall prescribe the form of a record of protected architectural structures.  Section 7 amends section 52 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by providing that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall issue guidelines to planning authorities concerning certain development objectives.<\/p> <p>I will now deal section 8, which is the amendment of section 177X, and section 9, which is the amendment of section 177Y, section 10, which is the amendment of section 177AB, and section 11 which is the amendment of section 177AC of the Act of 2000.  Part XAB of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for consultation by the primary Minister under the Act, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media was titled at the time of enactment.<\/p> <p>Sections 8 to 11, inclusive, amend sections 177X, 177Y, 177AB and 177AC within Part XAB of the Act in order to resolve the Mulcreevy problem in this section of the Act.  Section 12 amends section 59(3) of the Wildlife Act 1976 which refers to access to or use of foreshore for nature conservation purposes.  <\/p> <p>Section 13 amends section 16(2)(a) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 so that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall seek the observations of any Ministers of the Government as the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances of the proposed designation of a natural heritage area rather than seeking the observations of certain specified Ministers.<\/p> <p>Section 14 amends the designations of the sites of special areas of conservation and special protection areas and the directions and provisions of the  European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 by providing that the designation or direction process for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will inform another Minister or Ministers of developments.<\/p> <p>Section 15 provides, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage when he or she is performing a heritage function to first make a planning application to a planning authority, to make an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to make a request for a declaration to a planning authority, or a referral for a decision or apply for a determination to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as to exempt development and, finally, to do any act or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 relating to any of these matters.<\/p> <p>Part 3 of the Bill contains two sections in respect of the amending of the Broadcasting Act of 2009.<\/p> <p>In conclusion I am very pleased to have the opportunity to outline the provisions of this Bill here today and I look forward to hearing Senators' views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#YYY00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I now call Senator Garvey to speak.

It is my opinion that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is probably the perfect person to ensure that this new role is taken on by this Department and it will be done by him to the highest possible standards.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If anyone can keep on top of technical housing things, special areas of conservation and special protection areas, it is the Minister of State.

I concur with Senator Garvey that he has brought great energy and enthusiasm and insight to the area of heritage which is what we need.  We have a  very rich heritage, built and natural, and I have full confidence that he as Minister of State in the Department will really champion heritage over the course of the Government.<\/p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il group will support the Bill.  It provides for the transfer of functions to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and it empowers the Department and the Ministers in it to champion our heritage.  It also provides for the transfer of consultation and consent functions under the Broadcasting Act 2009 to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  It amends no fewer than five Acts, the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Wildlife Act 1976, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, the European Communities Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations 2011 and the Broadcasting Act 2009.  It also makes provision in relation to certain planning matters relating to heritage which are also important.  This is important housekeeping work.  It also provides for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be notified of proposed variations to planning authority development plans and the making of such variations.  Here in Dublin city, councillors are in the process of making a new city development plan.  The city and county development plans are hugely important documents that give local communities and individuals an opportunity to engage in setting the strategic planning objectives, not only for their communities but also their counties and cities.  It is important that we take care of these matters from a legislative perspective.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government sets out very important commitments in terms of our natural heritage, including the publishing and implementation of a new all Government heritage policy and its nationwide implementation, a commitment to explore multiannual funding models and ensure that adequate funding is made available for the implementation of each county heritage plan, promoting biodiversity initiatives across primary, post-primary and third level sectors and ensuring that every school, college and university across the country will play an active role in providing areas to promote biodiversity.  It is apt that we are having this debate this week.  Last week was national biodiversity week.  I live in the city but even in the city we have very rich biodiversity, everything from our pigeons to the flies and ants and wild flowers.  It is really important, and perhaps Covid has made us more aware of our natural environment and surroundings.  We all need to act to protect our biodiversity.  From a Government perspective, it is important this legislation is progressed promptly.  <\/p> <p>While the Minister of State is in the House, I want to mention something.  The built heritage in the city is very important and I want to thank him for the support he has lent to the regeneration and rejuvenation of what had become very derelict heritage in the heart of the inner city with the national monument buildings in 14 to 17 Moore Street.  The Minister of State's commitment has made a huge difference in not only ensuring the dereliction that has taken hold there on the street market and the national monument will not only be stopped but will be reversed and we will have a State-led rejuvenation of the street market and a national monument where our history will be recreated, reimagined and preserved and made available to future generations.  I thank him for the support he has lent the Moore Street advisory group, with stakeholders from the 1916 relatives, the street traders and all the businesses in the area.  They appreciate the fact that he has given it priority and will lead a State-led regeneration of the street market and the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre there.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend the Minister of State on that.

We are trying to ensure that we have all the technicalities in place to allow him to exercise his function as Minister of State with responsibility for heritage to the full extent, which I have no doubt he will do.<\/p> <p>Section 15 is appropriate in that it will give power to the Minister to comment on development plans.  As my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, said, 31 of the 33 local authorities are undertaking development plans currently, so it is particularly important to ensure that is in place.

He will be more than welcome to cross the River Suir into Waterford, given that he is a next-door neighbour in Kilkenny.  He might comment on the possibility of providing biodiversity officers within local authorities to supplement the work of heritage officers.  They are often overburdened, particularly in areas that have a rich heritage.  We are very lucky, both in my county, Waterford, and nationally, to have such a rich heritage, both man-made and natural.

As we have heard, the Bill will allow for the transfer of functions relating to heritage to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Notwithstanding my concerns regarding the constant moving of the National Parks and Wildlife Service from pillar to post over the years, it is at least somewhat reassuring that there is now a Minister of State such as Deputy Noonan, who clearly cares a great deal about the brief.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose the Bill, but I will outline a number of areas I hope the Minister of State will prioritise in his role.<\/p> <p>The first relates to the status of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  A review into this is under way but I add my voice to that of the Irish Wildlife Trust in calling for the service to be placed on a similar statutory footing to that of the EPA.  For too long, the NPWS has been underfunded and its research ignored.  This has impacted on morale within the organisation and has also negatively impacted on our biodiversity.  One such example is that of Killarney National Park and its management of rhododendron.  For more than 20 years, Groundwork ran a science-based, systematic clearance of the invasive plant from some of our most important ancient oak woodlands.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am very familiar with the scheme as I worked as both a volunteer and an employee of Groundwork.  Despite all of the evidence showing that the Groundwork approach worked, in its wisdom Killarney National Park halted Groundwork in 2005 and adopted a system of leaving dead rhododendron standing <i>in situ <\/i>or in piles.  There is strong evidence to suggest that this policy contributed to the devastating fires that we witnessed last month.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service manual No. 33 clearly referred to standing dead rhododendron as a potential fire hazard.  It also referred to the need for fire breaks around dead rhododendron hedges.  Despite this clear advice from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Killarney National Park 2018 management plan is a direct contradiction to the service and states that there is no requirement for rhododendron brash management.  I hope that a future National Parks and Wildlife Service will be able to ensure that its advice is not just advisory but carries legal weight that must be heeded by national park management.  I hope the National Parks and Wildlife Service will be given the enforcement powers it requires to tackle wildlife crime.<br\/><br\/>I raise the need for marine protection zones to be implemented in parallel with the marine planning framework.  We cannot have a situation whereby planning permission will be granted for large offshore wind farms before we have designated our most important marine wildlife zones.  We have to ensure there is a marine inspectorate body established to ensure that the construction, operation and any future decommissioning of offshore wind farms is done with the highest possible environmental and biodiversity protections.  Not only is that good for our marine wildlife but it will also ensure we have fewer planning objections and therefore bring our offshore wind capacity online as fast as possible to meet our climate targets.<br\/><br\/>I implore that the biodiversity data centre find a permanent home within the Heritage Council so we retain the expertise of the researchers and the data they collect.  Such an important resource cannot continue on a service level agreement.  It is bad for the morale of the researchers and for retention of that expertise within the Department.<br\/><br\/>I raise the matter of Moore Street and ask the Minister of State to ensure that the plan for the 1916 cultural quarter, as set out by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, and unanimously supported by all parties, is implemented.<br\/><br\/>We support this Bill, which will see the Minister of State receive all of his functions, but I ask that he give the matters outlined by me his utmost attention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#AAAA00400","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has heard the high regard he is held in across the House and I echo much of that but everybody is speaking to and anticipating the positive use he might make of the powers under this Act.  My concern is not about persons but about structures.  My concerns relate to the legislation in front of us and the fact that the Minister in this legislation is not the Minister of State but the primary Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  That is clear in the briefing note.  The reason that matters is nothing about who is in which roles.  There is a reason this is in legislation.  It is not a technical Bill.  If it was a technical matter, it would have been transferred under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, as those other powers often have been.<\/p> <p>The reason we are having a debate and need legislation is that our planning architecture has checks and balances within it, including checks on the powers of the Minister for planning and housing.  The reasonable provisions in section 30(1), which is being amended here and which is called \"Limitation on Ministerial power\", state that the Minister responsible for the entire architecture of planning should \"not exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case\".  There is a reason that provision is there in law.  It is an appropriate check.  There is a reason the Minister is limited.  The Minister in charge of An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the planning authority should not be able to ask it for things, in terms of planing applications, appeals, or determinations, including a determination of exemption from certain planning obligations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a reason that check and balance existed, and there were exceptions to it in previous Bills.  There were exceptions in terms of the performance of certain functions, but none of them included the provisions or wide powers being set out in this Bill in regard to planning applications, appeals and determinations.  I accept they are performed in regard to certain functions, but the point I am making is it matters who performs them.  We should have had a check and balance between Departments previously.  That is what the Mulcreevy case tell us.  It is not an oversight; the primary legislation intended the division of function between two different Ministries because the Minister with responsibility for planning has particular concerns and thoughts, and the Minister with responsibility for heritage has a different mandate, a different duty of care and a different set of concerns to be mindful of.  That is part of the system in regard to many of the important matters with which we deal, including how we deal with appropriate assessment, for example, what may or may not constitute an imperative reason of overriding public interest that allows us to skip over or damage Natura 2000 sites.  These are all areas where the Minister with responsibility for planning and housing was required to consult with the Minister with responsibility for heritage for a reason.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge that the Minister is doing a great deal of good work in the Department, but if those checks and balances are no longer in existence between departments we need to be clear in this legislation that they will still exist within the Department.  It is not simply a matter of who allocates the tasks, it is vitally important that it is the Minister with responsibility for heritage who gives heritage observations on local development plans.  I am speaking not about the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, as a person but as the Minister with responsibility for heritage and not the Minister with responsibility for planning and housing.  It is the Minister with responsibility for heritage who must be consulted in regard to any decisions on Natura 2000 sites and their protection in a planning imperative measure.  <\/p><p>We need to see those measures.  The Minister of State will be aware that I have put forward amendments to attempt to insert those safeguards, but I remain concerned.  In the briefing note it is explicitly clear that section 30 must be amended to provide for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage as the primary Minister to exercise these functions.  We need clarity on whether it will be the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who, under the amended section 30, will perform this function and if it will be him only who can submit planning applications and appeals.  <\/p><p>The Bill also provides that certain other remainders of heritage powers and functions may be transferred to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  How can we be sure that these powers will be appropriately delegated and that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will be able to fulfil his mandate in terms of heritage in an appropriate conversation with the Minister with responsibility for planning and housing, and that that check and balance will be intact?

I do not agree with the Department's view that councillors cannot comment on planning applications.  Councillors spend a lot of time developing and studying county development plans.  In the case of a planning application, which may be controversial or not, on which a decision may be imminent or made, a councillor is prohibited from taking any stock as to what the executive can or cannot do.  We have seen some deplorable planning decisions by executives over the years.  I appreciate that the main function of councillors is to put in place county development plans, but when they put those plans in place, surely they should have some form of oversight of them to ensure transparency.  Councillors who have spent years putting together the plans should be able to comment on them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They all might agree that in their view a planning application might not fit into an area.  At the end of the day a planning decision is only somebody's view anyway.  In most cases it is a view - my view or the planner's view.  This is something the Minister of State should look at.  The Minister has taken away the powers of councillors to comment in the chamber on planning applications.<\/p><p>I am nearly out of time, but I wish to refer to another area the Minister should have a look at.  I refer to discussing county development plans on Zoom or other form of e-meeting facility.  I am not sure it is in the best interests of putting a county development plan together.  Some councillors could be under pressure.  There could be somebody in the room with them.  The telephone line or Internet might go down.  A whole host of problems can arise.  This is an area the Minister of State should examine.  A county development plan is a very legal document.  Many decisions are taken in it on development plans.

I take on board that the structure will be determined by the outputs of the report.  There has been a significant level of engagement.  Rhododendron management in Killarney National Park has been widely raised.  We have ongoing meetings regarding it.  I have read some of the reports and it is something to which we will give consideration.<\/p> <p>The wildlife crime unit will be established later this year.  There is a good, positive alignment between marine protected areas and marine planning legislation, and I hope we will be in a position to highlight that in the coming weeks and months.

Similarly, the issue of Moore Street has been raised.<\/p> <p>On Committee Stage I will address the issues raised by Senator Higgins, and Senator Burke's reference to planning applications being in public.  Councillors have the right to make submissions on planning applications, the same as members of the public.  Reference was made to discussing development plans over Zoom.  We are all tired of Zoom, but there is a significant role for e-planning, and we should look at some of its merits and good outcomes.  In particular, online meetings have helped councillors with time management.  Some counties have done very well with the management of development plans over Zoom.  I thank Senator Ahearn for the issues he raised about Knocklofty House.<\/p> <p>Ireland's heritage, built and natural, cultural, linguistic, tangible and intangible, is of fundamental importance to all aspects of society, our identity, well-being and economy.  However, heritage faces many challenges, including those stemming from land use change, climate change and biodiversity loss and dereliction through a lack of awareness of the value of heritage.  The Government is making a significant investment in the heritage sector with a view to addressing biodiversity loss, habitat restoration and species protection.  It is also undertaking essential investment in national parks, nature reserves, heritage estates and national monuments.  For example, earlier this year, funding of &euro;1.35 million was announced for local authority biodiversity projects, including &euro;500,000 for projects targeting invasive alien species in their areas.  The significant funding increase in 2021 to &euro;1.89 million means the National Parks and Wildlife Service farm plan scheme has been expanded.  The sum of &euro;14 million has been allocated to conservation management and restoration of protected raised bogs in 2021.<\/p> <p>National parks and nature reserves have remained open for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has been important to keep this 87,000 ha network accessible to the public to provide areas where people can get fresh air, experience nature and exercise while still being able to adhere to physical distancing protocols.<\/p> <p>The intention of the Planning and Development, Heritage, Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill is not to alter existing Government policy or to introduce new policy, it is a technical Bill, the primary function of which is to facilitate the transfer of the heritage powers and functions to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage under a number of enactments which are currently held by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media.  In that regard, the overall objective is to give legislative underpinning to the full transfer of these powers and functions to the Minister through amending certain primary and secondary legislation, as required.  Some of the proposed amendments set out in the Bill have been prepared to allow for the amended section of the relevant European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 to function without further amendment in the event that the ministerial heritage functions were at some future time separated again from the planning functions.  Section 13 amends section 16(2)(a) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and section 14 amends the designations of the sites of special areas of conservation and special protection areas and the directions and provisions of the 2011 regulations.  We are working hard to deliver on the ambitions set out in the programme for Government with respect to heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#DDDD00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621848600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEEE00100","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEEE00200","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

In the Bill, these provisions seem like a belt and braces approach.  Section 30 limited the power of the Minister with responsibility for planning to interfere in individual planning cases with certain exceptions, those exceptions being all of the ones that are covered in this section where it states that he could interfere or engage but only subject to &ldquo;consultations with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht&rdquo;.  These are effectively the braces of the belt and braces approach that are meant to be part of the checks and balances in our section.  That applies from sections 8 to 11, inclusive, which deals with, as people have described, the incredibly important things like Natura 2000 sites and appropriate assessments.  We know from our planning, because the problem has often been that environmental factors and obligations have not been considered early enough in the planning process, that leads to problems down the line, which we have seen repeatedly.<\/p> <p>These are important functions that the Minister with responsibility for heritage had and I want to know two things.  Will the Minister of State's Department perform them?  Will the senior Minister be obliged to consult with the Minister of State's Department on his actions in these areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEEE00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 1 and 6 to 13, inclusive.<\/p> <p>I reiterate that this is a technical Bill which is necessary to allow for the transfer of functions relating to heritage under a number of different enactments to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

We are taking away another small element of the checks and balance system in our planning architecture.  If issues arise further down the line then we need to be really clear that that is done.  I do not think that that is necessary.  These checks and balances could be accommodated within the Department but an explicit realisation needs to exist whereby certain functions need to be in balance with certain other functions and how those are divided.  This has nothing to do with who is in which roles.  This has to do with having an appropriate architecture that will stand the test of time if other persons take on senior or junior ministries within these roles.  It is a fact that the Minister with responsibility for planning is meant to check in with somebody whose primary focus is heritage in terms of certain functions that he or she performs.  That is my core point but it has not been addressed.  I would like this matter to be addressed in the legislation.

This is the problem.  At the moment these powers are consolidated with a single Minister who would previously have been required to check with the Minister with responsibility for heritage.  Under several other provisions and sections the Minister would have been required to speak to the Minister in charge of the environment and other Ministers.  Now we have a situation whereby the Minister has the power and may or may not consult with other Ministers as he or she sees fit.  We are removing checks and balances internally in terms of heritage.  This is the fundamental concern I have.<\/p><p>This does not have to be a problem.  It is not a problem that the functions are going to the same Department but it is a problem if appropriate measures are not taken.  We talk about this with companies all the time, including with the idea of the firewall.  If a person is undertaking one function, then we do not have the same people in the same company performing the same function.  It is a normal practice to put in place measures and appropriate division of powers internally.<\/p><p>There were several points relevant to amendment No. 1.  I understand from the grouping that amendments Nos. 6 to 15, inclusive, are also included.  There were points with these amendments whereby the Minister was required to consult with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Several of those sections have been truncated.  I understand that the titles in such sections may have been outdated but the principle of consultation was important.  I have several amendments in which I suggest that rather than saying \"such Ministers as the Minister considers should be notified\", we say that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and such Ministers as the Minister considers should be consulted.  I think that is appropriate.<\/p><p>This relates to the Wildlife Act and other measures relating to habitats and wildlife.  Section 14 relates to the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) (Amendment) Regulations 2011.  These are all areas where it is appropriate that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications would be consulted.  I have framed the reference to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in my amendments in a way to allow it to be flexible.  This means if the environment functions get moved to another brief and combined in a different title, then the Minister with responsibility for the environment would be consulted.  Similarly, whatever Minister or Minister of State has responsibility specifically for heritage might be consulted.<\/p><p>These are safeguards that I am putting in place.  I say as much respectfully to the Minister of State because I really admire his work.  However, I need to be confident that we are putting in place good legislation.  If I was hearing an interpretation of the legislation that gave us assurance that would be something, but I am not even hearing an interpretation of the legislation that indicates an understanding of the needs for checks and balances or consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEEE03300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on this from the outside and as someone who sits on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

As stated in my opening address, Part XAB of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for consultation by the primary Minister under the Act, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht - this was the title of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media at the time of enactment - as to whether the compensatory measures specified by a competent authority are sufficient to ensure that the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network, European sites, special areas of conservation and special protection areas are protected where the making of certain land use plans specified in the Act or the granting of consent for proposed development under the Act would adversely affect the ecological integrity of the European sites.

One of the things which ensured we never did was because there were checks and balances.  This is really important and it is something we lose without consultation.  It is not simply about who makes the decision.  It is about transparency around how the decision is made.  One of the things which was good about consulting with a Minister was that there were two different opinions available to the public, the concerned, the planners, and those in the Oireachtas.  There were two different opinions and two different areas of expertise brought to bear on such a serious decision.  That is an example whereby having a different and particular set of perspectives is vitally important.  I worry that we will lose an element of transparency there.

I often compare it in sporting parlance to the greatest prize in Irish sport: the Sam Maguire.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

It draws the largest crowd.  It is a special day with the Celtic cross on one's back pocket if one is lucky enough to get one.  It has been proven that it takes years of preparation to win the Sam Maguire.  Professor Niall Moyna trained those Dublin lads as youngsters.  He took them through the Sigerson Cup and now they dominate.  The Minister does not need any advice from me or anyone else.  He knows that it takes time and it is unfair for people to snap their fingers at him and say \"where are the houses?\" tomorrow.  I see good in everyone but I do not see politics generally exploiting this issue.  They are reflecting the anger of the people.  Come general election season, it might be very different but I see passion and fire in people's bellies when they talk about this issue and we must respect and reflect that but it is very important that the debate is couched and based in reality.  Therefore, I was happy that one of Ireland's expert spokespeople - no one less than Deputy &Oacute; Broin - accepted that we need a certain amount of private investment as a catalyst to get apartments built.  This came from a Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#LLLL00300","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I never heard that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#MMMM00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach said on the radio today how pleased he was to hear that sober analysis from Sinn F&eacute;in.

It may be inadvertent but it is a dishonest argument to make.<\/p> <p>Two of my fellow Green Senators addressed the Minister on this before we resumed today.  I will bring two issues to the Minister's attention.  The Vienna model has been Green Party bread and butter policy for years.  The rent is the cost of the build and is capped at 3.5%.  I think we are hoping to roll out 440 units this year.  I am convinced this is the way forward.  The Minister might let us know whether he might be open-minded regarding more in the long term and whether we can expedite that amazing model.  We are a long way from it but in Vienna, these houses are all the same and people who can afford more pay more under the same model.  It houses more than 6% of the population of Vienna.  We must take baby steps here but putting that on a statutory footing would be legacy stuff for the Minister and the Government and they should take a bow.  There are so many criticisms.  It is very important and helps the morale of people who are waiting on a house to let them know about some of the good news.  This is something about which I am particularly passionate.  I think the Minister is on record as saying that it would be approximately 25% less than market value but it looks like 40% in some places.  In Stepaside and Enniskerry, it will be capped at &euro;1,200 per month for a two-bed that would go for &euro;2,000 per month on the market tomorrow so that would look more like 40%.  I am asking the Minister to think about this.  Social housing is needed but we should not just go one way.  In my home county of Kildare, 125 units were bought, all of which were social housing.  The neighbours next door wanted affordable and private housing, be it with the help of Rebuilding Ireland, and restrained themselves from trying to block planning permission.  That goodwill is gone.  A social mix of all the different types of housing is the way to go.  We need the Minister's leadership to ask Kildare County Council, which is doing its best and is under pressure, for a mix because it is proven to be more vibrant and dynamic for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#MMMM00300","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the Chamber.  I commend him on bringing forward this comprehensive Bill on affordable housing.  I support all types of housing.

It is important that we have a mixed housing model in respect of supporting private, social and affordable housing and AHBs.  I believe every community should have that mix of housing.  I have supported the development of 49 houses as part of a turnkey development in my community of Moycullen before the last election.  To be honest, it might be one of the reasons I am in this Chamber but I supported it.  Some Fianna F&aacute;il councillors did not but that is part and parcel of politics.

It caused certain ructions in the community.  It was on the basis that there were no private houses coming forward.  A number of private applications that have been granted in my community have not progressed.  Planning permission has been granted but for whatever reason, they have not progressed.  There are developers running back to the local authority to see whether they can get turnkey development, which in my mind means that there is an issue with equity.  There is an issue with developers having the wherewithal to build private houses.  As I said, there needs to be that mix of housing.  It is desirable for people to own their own home.  Most of us wish that everyone would be able to aspire to owning their own home.  Indeed the beauty of the tenant purchase model was that the aspiration was there for people who started off renting a home to purchase it in the future.  This is right and proper.  It gives people a real stake in their community.  That is what people want.  That is what we all want.<\/p> <p>The issue of equity is real.  I am talking about developers having the equity to build houses.  If we are to make progress in the short-term, we need to see why those planning applications that are live - those that have been granted in the past year or two - are not moving and what we can do to get them to move.  It involves carrot and stick because those are the ones that are the quickest to build.  We can talk about sites being zoned and the LDA but how do we get building on those sites that have planning permission?  What are the stumbling blocks and issues that mean those developments do not progress because those are the ones where people will put down deposits and purchase next year, the following year and the year after that?  This is the reality.  The quickest fix will come from those with planning permission.  <\/p> <p>The affordable element is hugely important.  As long as the increase in the percentage of social and affordable housing to 20% is funded and is not a deterrent to the same developers pushing forward, it will be important and I welcome it.  However, we must ensure that it is not a further deterrent.  We amended that previously to encourage some development and provide houses and jobs because nothing was happening.  We need to ensure the increase does not act as a deterrent.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  I encourage the Minister to engage with developers, large and small, to discover why planning applications are not moving, developments are not being built and homes are not available in the private market and under Part V for social housing, particularly with the increase proposed in this Bill for affordable housing.  I look forward to further engagement.  I spoke on the Order of Business regarding the planning process, which is part of the Minister's brief.  Many projects, not just related to housing are being stymied.  These projects will take a significant number of years for any progress to be made even though funding has been announced.  It is something that we have to look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#MMMM00600","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is great we have the Bill coming to the House and have an opportunity to talk about the transformative impact the Department and the Minister are having on housing policy in the country.  The Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill are two landmark Bills that will make a real difference to many citizens across the country in delivering real homes, real houses and keys in people's hands, which is what it is all about.<\/p> <p>We have had a decade of difficulty in housing and it has built up to boiling point.  However, it is a credit to the Minister and his team that, even in the midst of a global pandemic, when the vast majority of construction has been shut down for the past year, they still managed to deliver almost 450 cost rental units and they have got this legislation through the House despite all of the chaos that has been happening in the world around us.<\/p> <p>For the first time in almost a decade, we will have affordable homes, led by the State and built by the State on State land.  That is something that has been demanded for many years; it is happening now and it is being delivered.  We will also have a cost rental scheme, something that has not happened previously, and that is being delivered as well.  We have a shared equity scheme so that people who are out of that bracket of affordability can afford a home and will be helped by the State, which will take an equity share in the house to ensure they can afford a home and put a roof over their heads.  That is being delivered now.<\/p> <p>All of this, and the Minister is only in the brief for ten months.  That should be commended across the House.  However, there are a small few in the Oireachtas who do not want to see the Minister deliver in his brief and who do not want homes built because that means it is a win for the Government, but it is not seen as a win for the Irish people, or a win for the thousands of young people across the country, the first-time buyers, individuals, single people, couples and families who cannot get a home currently because of the broken system we are trying to repair.  I implore those who seek to undermine really positive changes in housing policy to get on board the train because it is leaving the station and most of us are already on it.<\/p> <p>With regard to the stamp duty issue that arose in recent weeks, to take a positive perspective, we need some private investment and Senator Kyne rightly pointed out that when REITs were introduced in 2013, they were needed to stimulate development.  Two years later, the Labour leader stood on his feet in the D&aacute;il and said it was a good thing and that we needed it.  With any policy in an area that is as fast moving as housing, we have to be in a position to review those policies as we move along and things change, because things do change.  It is a credit to the Government that when a specific issue arose in Kildare that really blew up and caught people's imagination, within a number of weeks the issue was addressed and dealt with by Government, and that has been delivered.<\/p> <p>The Government is reacting, responding and listening to people.  I know there were some concerns regarding apartments not being included but there is a reason for not including them, which is that we do not want to impact supply.  Again, we have to react in the right way.  It is about maintaining private investment in a targeted way so we can still maintain the supply we are getting but also increase that supply, because, at the end of the day, it is all about supply and getting more houses built.<\/p> <p>I want to raise a particular concern regarding the cost of building.  We know costs are increasing.  Some of that is down to the Brexit impact, which we have not had much time to discuss this past year, and some of it is down to the pandemic that has impacted the supply chains.  Overall, the cost of building is creeping up and up.  When we remove those two big issues that are obviously causing problems in supply, we need to keep an eye on this issue and make sure the cost of building is where it should be and that people can still afford to build.<\/p> <p>My next point is around the importance of getting housing policy right because if we do not, social cohesion will break down.  Every member of our community and our society needs to feel that they have skin in the game.  Part of that is owning their own home because it is then in their interest to keep a stable Government, to maintain cohesion in the country and to maintain cohesion in communities.  When people feel they have been left behind and that the current policies are not working for them, they start to break away, and that is when social cohesion breaks down.  That is bad for everybody.  That is why it is very important that we fix this problem.  The Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that housing is the issue of our generation, and it is.  If we do not get this right, thousands of couples, individuals and an entire generation will be left behind, and will be in a poorer position than their parents were before them.<\/p> <p>There are concerns around too many people being stuck in rental units who do not want to be there.  I caveat that by saying many people want to rent, and that is okay too.  We should not prescribe to people how they should live or what kind of housing they should demand.  There is no one silver bullet that will fix this.  We need to provide apartments, houses, rental accommodation and owner-occupied accommodation.  People have to have choice, and that is why this Bill is providing that choice.  The Minister has rectified the issue around the percentage of each development that goes to social and affordable housing and he has doubled that from 10% to 20%.  Again, that is going to have a direct impact on every single development in the country, and will provide apartments and houses to people and give them the choice they so need.<\/p> <p>I wish the Minister well in his brief.  He has a tough job ahead but he has a good team in government behind him.  I have no doubt the vast majority of Members of this House will be with him and supporting him in the job he has ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#NNNN00050","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss housing, a topic that has not the headlines for almost 14 years.  How long has Ireland had a housing crisis?  How long has Ireland been in its homelessness crisis?  How long will it be before the Government seeks to deliver effective solutions to these problems?  The Government has committed to the mission of housing for all, and this is the first problem.  The mission should be homes for all, and the Bill should have a name change accordingly.  A fundamental attitude change should be taking place across the board in this respect.<\/p><p>Supply of affordable homes that people have the means to purchase or rent is the key issue.  New planning guidelines issued by the Minister ban bulk purchasing of houses and duplexes but developers can still bulk purchase apartments.  The new owner-occupier guarantee measures also do not include apartments.  Ireland has a supply issue and by confining our solutions to the supply of houses and duplexes, we are still confining supply.  Ireland needs more homes and the Affordable Housing Bill does not go about supplying these.<\/p><p>The Bill contains three schemes, which were described as swift, short-term measures aimed at the ongoing housing crisis at the Seanad Second Stage briefing.  However, what about the long-term effects of such short-term solutions?  First, I draw attention to the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; in the affordable dwelling purchase scheme.  Why are we focused on purchasing?  Why are we focused on providing homes to buy?  Why are we not considering those who do not want to purchase?  Some people are perfectly happy to rent from local authorities.  Apartments and houses that are rented at affordable rates can be homes; they can be affordable homes and they can be an effective solution.<\/p><p>Admittedly, the Bill does have a provision for a rental scheme.  It is stated that the Government wishes to introduce the European cost rental scheme to Ireland, something which was recommended by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI.  However, the briefing paper provided to Senators on the Bill explains that this form of tenure will have to compete against the heavily incentivised purchase scheme.  Those on average incomes will have to decide between home ownership and home rental, and if the Government is focusing on providing affordable homes to purchase, then apartments will remain unaffordable to rent.  The Government's heavy incentive for home ownership could undermine this one effort it makes for renters in the housing market.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the issue of supply remains.  Under the affordable dwelling purchase scheme, the serviced sites fund will use &euro;188 million to supply 6,200 new houses.  To make these new builds more affordable for the purchaser, the Government wants to instigate an affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  This is a scheme the ESRI has specifically warned against.  Dr Conor O'Toole of the ESRI, speaking at a Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage meeting, informed the Government that increasing purchasing power for households through a loosening of credit constraints is likely to lead to higher house prices in the long term.  If the Government wants to increase buyers&rsquo; purchasing power with the affordable purchase equity scheme, it would need to guarantee that the supply of affordable homes is adequate to meet the demand.  Unless the Government can guarantee this adequate supply, this Bill will cause an acute increase in the severity of the affordability issue.<\/p><p>The Central Bank released figures in 2019 stating that Ireland would require 34,000 new dwellings every year for the next ten years to meet demand.  In 2020, with the outbreak of the pandemic, 20,000 houses were built and the ESRI has predicted that this figure will fall to 15,000 this year.  Considering this, it is fair to say the Government cannot guarantee adequate supply when the funds that have been allocated to these measures will only increase housing by 6,200 between now and 2023.  Furthermore, Colm McCarthy noted in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>at the weekend that serial objectors to planning permissions are holding up the plans the Government and developers have in place, people who traverse the country with almost unlimited access to the courts to object to building plans.  The short-term fix will have the long-term cost of making our housing more expensive because the planning system itself is broken and the supply is not there.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the 2019 budget, the Government allocated &euro;146 million towards homelessness services.  In December 2020, we still had 8,200 homeless people in the country.  Under the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Government will be spending more money on the housing crisis but will this really solve the issue?  The Minister should consider assembling a task force which would bring in everybody, including the chief executives of county councils, senior planners, representatives from Irish Water and all the developers who have zoned and serviced lands ready to go.  We should have them all walk out with planning permissions that meet the needs of the community in each county, allowing them to get the job done.<\/p><p>I have spoken before about how the Government's lack of clarity on its housing policies and guidelines is leading to incohesive decisions at local level.  Last year, residential land in Meath was dezoned in accordance with Government regulations and directions from the Office of the Planning Regulator.  A task force would bring deliver a co-ordinated approach which would help to avoid decisions like that made by Meath County Council, which has affected housing supply in the county and, therefore, the affordability of houses.  If the Minister for Health can be given emergency powers during a pandemic, why can the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage not be given emergency powers to do what is necessary during the housing crisis?  The International Monetary Fund recommended that Ireland tackle the housing problem-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#NNNN00150","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I must ask the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#OOOO00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

Having been in the House for five years when he was Leader of the Opposition, I know how constructive and engaging he is.  I also know how committed he is to reform.  I have no doubt that he will want to deliver in the housing brief.  Over recent months, he has put his mark on the Department.  I am optimistic about the future.  The only way to resolve the housing crisis is to get houses built.  It is a very simple equation of supply and demand.  We will not reach equilibrium until such time as supply meets demand.  That is the challenge.  Houses must be affordable to people earning middle incomes.  That is what we are striving for as a country.  That is what we want to deliver for our communities.<\/p> <p>There are, however, blockages.  The Minister is very much aware of these and has spoken many times about them and about what he is doing to resolve them both in the media and in these Houses.  As we move along our journey towards building 30,000 to 40,000 houses a year, further blockages and unintended situations will arise.  As they do, we will, as a Government, show flexibility to engage and deal with them.  I refer to issues we have not yet imagined.  This was proved when the issue of bulk buying arose in Maynooth.  I remember being in this House when that measure was introduced.  It was introduced in 2013 because nobody was buying houses.  There was no incentive to do so.  The housing market had to be kick-started.  Like many measures, it has served its purpose and now needs to be refined, which it has been.<\/p> <p>The affordable housing legislation with which we are dealing this evening is very ambitious but it will do what it says on the front of the Bill.  It will create affordable housing.  That is what people have been speaking about.  It was one of the main issues in the last general election and was one of the main political issues before the pandemic.  We in County Clare face a number of challenges.  I live in Lahinch in the west coast area of County Clare, as the Minister knows, and in my own immediate area there is a proliferation of holiday homes which are very necessary and which serve a very important purpose.  Unfortunately, they are empty for seven or eight months of the year.  It is reasonable to levy a tax on vacant second homes.  If somebody can afford a second home which they do not rent out at any time of the year, it is reasonable to place a levy on that house above and beyond the property tax.  <\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, there is also a problem with sewerage and waste water infrastructure in a number of our villages in County Clare.  I have spoken to the Minister about this many times.  I am thinking of places like Doolin.  This village is known worldwide but no houses or developments can be built there because the waste water and sewage system is just not up to standard.  Any applications lodged are deemed premature until such time as the infrastructure is upgraded.  There are similar situations in Carrigaholt in west Clare, in Cooraclare and in Broadford.  I have been to the Custom House with colleagues and we have spoken to the Minister about the challenges.  I know he is committed to finding a resolution whereby there can be engagement between Irish Water, the local authorities and his Department with a view to dealing with these small schemes which, if dealt with, would open up a lot of potential development in villages throughout County Clare and throughout the country.  I have spoken of four villages in Clare but I could speak of 40.  The four I have mentioned are in dire need of an upgrade.  I know the Minister has provided extra funding of, I believe, &euro;150 million to Irish Water specifically to target this area.<\/p> <p>There is another challenge in many rural towns.  I refer to towns that had a number of clothes shops, shoe shops, drapers and other shops, all of which are now closed and which, realistically, will never open as retail units again.  We need living accommodation above these shops.  We need to be able to change what were retail shops into residential accommodation where people can live.  That will, of course, require schemes.  I know the Minister is looking at that as well.  We could talk all evening but I know time is limited.  I wish the Minister every success in the tough job before him.  He has our absolute and full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#OOOO00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach and the Minister, I will move briefly to another topic.

I particularly congratulate the FAI on its appointment of Packie Bonner, a great Donegal man and a great ambassador for this country.  I did not get the opportunity to come in this morning on the Order of Business.  The FAI has righted a wrong.  I believe it is on the right path.  It has a few more people to look after and I hope it does so.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the space to say that.<\/p> <p>I could not start a speech on the topic of housing without referring to the mica redress scheme in Donegal.  This issue has also affected Mayo.  I thank the Minister for meeting the deputation last Thursday.  I believe all the issues are now before him.  With the best will in the world, I ask him to look at these issues as expeditiously as he can.  I know he is keeping in close contact with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.

Housing was one of the most dominant issues in the last election.  It is one of the cornerstones of the programme for Government, a Government in which three parties are involved.  This Bill is a means to achieve the end of alleviating the immense pressure felt by renters and home buyers.  It is not the silver bullet the Opposition keeps pretending exists.  The issues affecting housing are complex and broad in scope.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall Blaney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Housing in this country requires a multipronged approach.  This Bill does that.  The provisions in the Bill target buyers and renters to make housing more affordable.  The Minister has come under a great deal of opposition in the last while.  To those opposing him, I say, \"Bring it on lads\", but they have only a short number of months to do so.  The approach of the Minister and the Government to housing will become clear in 12 to 24 months.  We are determined to undo the difficulties such that housing will be achievable and affordable, and families and individuals across the country can aspire to own their own homes.  We support the Minister's efforts.  <\/p><p>It has been said by parties and commentators on all sides of this issue that supply is the fundamental issue.  Through this Bill, local authorities will be incentivised to build in local areas and to deliver housing for purchase.  That is key.  The Bill provides that a variety of houses be built to support the requirements of applicants.  This is a short addition to the legislation, but one that must be commended as we frequently hear of people not being able to find accommodation that suits their needs.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a long history of social housing provision.  This Bill maintains that commitment, while making provision for affordable housing to be provided for those who want it.  The shared equity scheme is a great step forward on behalf of the State.  It supports the purchase of housing rather than leaving that to the free market.<\/p><p>The introduction of price caps on properties is a radical measure in response to the housing crisis.  The complexity and depth of the housing crisis in Ireland means housing must be supplied by both Government and private investors.  There is no escaping that fact.  Capping the cost of State provided homes is a great step forward.  This Bill is an overwhelmingly positive start in getting us back on track in housing provision, but more work needs to be done.  We put our full weight and support behind the Minister in doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#OOOO00500","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  As the Minister will know, details matter.  The success or failure of this Bill to deliver what it aspires to do will depend on the detail within it.  Everyone across this Chamber wants housing that is affordable.  We all want people to have a decent sustainable roof over their heads.  We all recognise the incredible challenges for young workers in trying to access affordable housing.  The concept of cost rental, the expansion of Part V and the prospect of affordable purchase housing are all welcome, but how we do it matters.  The Government cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of its past.  In that context, I am extremely concerned about a number of aspects of this Bill.<\/p> <p>Cost rental as set out in the Bill does not equate to affordable rent.  The Bill sets out that rent be 25% below the open market rate.  The reality of that approach is that it is out of touch with what is happening, particularly in the area that I know best, this is, Dublin city and the northside of Dublin.  Do we seriously think it is okay that a worker in the Dublin area on average take home pay of just over &euro;2,000 per month should go from facing rents of 84% of his or her monthly take home pay to 63% of his or her monthly wage, or that for those rents to work he or she will have to be part of a couple or live with another person?  My party submitted amendments that would define affordability as a specific share of an individual's income, but the Government knew better.  The market has to be allowed to decide the cost of rent.  The question that has to be asked is if we really have that much faith in the market that we expect rents to increase at an acceptable rate.  The reality, particularly in Dublin's north inner city and beyond in Dublin central and the northside of Dublin, the areas with which I am familiar, is that institutional investors are effectively keeping rent artificially inflated because they can afford to offer rent-free months.  They have the financial wherewithal and fire power to be able to offer rent-free months in order to keep rents elevated.  That brings me to my second concern.<\/p> <p>This Bill is silent on housing affordability and housing standards in the part of the housing market to be developed by the private sector.  That is not good enough.  The private sector will always have a role in developing housing in this country, but there is no reason it should be the wild west which, in parts of housing at the moment, in particular build-to-rent, it is.  In excluding apartments from the stamp duty changes, we can now anticipate that there will be a scramble of institutional funds into apartments.  Why would any institutional investor build conventional apartments when there is a higher yield from build-to-rent?  The impact of that build-to-rent on the local housing market is that, at scale, institutional investors can effectively set the rent for the local area, thereby up-ending the concept of cost rental being 25% below the open market rate and that that will ever be affordable.  <\/p> <p>If the Minister is truly serious about promoting affordable housing across all aspects of housing in this State, then I appeal to him to level the playing field in the development of apartments in this country.   We have only to look at my own area of Dublin central where planning for 1,500 conventional apartments is being sought or they are currently under construction.  Contrast that with over 5,000 build-to-rent, co-living or student accommodation units.  That indicates where the big money is going.  We need to remove the incentive to institutional investors to invest in only one type of housing, which is build-to-rent.  Currently, build-to-rent means lower housing standards such as smaller floor area.  There is also more flexibility with regard to storage space and less of an onus to provide a balcony or dual aspect and there is no restriction on the mix of housing.  We need to reform the tax advantage that is given to REITs.  When introduced, they were never intended as a long-term housing support measure.  We need to introduce rent controls on new units because at the moment build-to-rent units are not subject to rent caps.  <\/p> <p>With regard to the purchase of land, because of the tax advantages that institutional investors can avail of in this country they can buy up tracks of land within our cities and develop a poorer quality of housing.  Small developers and local authorities and, perhaps, the Land Development Agency, LDA, when it is up and running, will not be able to compete with the offers of the institutional investors.  The Labour Party will bring forward amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously engage with them.  We want to get this Bill right and if the Minister accepts our amendments, we will support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#PPPP00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I support this legislation, which together with the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, will provide much-needed social and affordable housing to purchase and rent in this State.<\/p> <p>Most modest earners are locked out of the housing market.  They do not earn enough such that three and a half times their salary will yield them a mortgage that will buy them a property.  However, perversely, they can pay 40% or more of their wages and salaries in rent.  This group are living with parents to try and save.  In my constituency of Dublin South Central, there are parents with two and three of their adult children and, in some cases, their partners and spouses, living under their roof while they save as much as they can for a deposit.  Couples are delaying the start of their families due to the cost of providing housing.  They cannot afford it.  Affordable rental in the form of long-term tenure in the cost rental dwellings planned and assistance in purchase, either through the shared equity scheme or local authority affordable purchase schemes, are welcome developments.  I congratulate the Minister in that regard.<\/p> <p>Some in this House do not believe in home ownership.  Some believe that rental should be cross-subsidised by further taxing those already priced out of the market, the so-called middle, and others believe that cost rental should include those who have the option to access social housing, even though that would mean diluting the provision for those who will never quality for social housing and cannot buy.  I believe in mixed tenure in all developments.  It is good for everyone and it brings equality for everyone to share their communities.  I hear and echo some of the concerns of communities, such as Drimnagh, that the building proposed in their areas is cost rental or of particularly one tenure.  That may lend itself to a transitory population who are not invested in their communities long term.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I urge the Minister to ensure that this will not be the case through incentives and regulations.  I know he has already considered that.  There is a need to ensure that infrastructural provisions are in place.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the current provision for cr&egrave;ches to be built at a ratio of one cr&egrave;che for every 75 dwelling units, which is a great idea but, in reality, is not working.  A recent application for a development in Crumlin which obtained planning permission exempted itself on the basis of there being adequate provision of cr&egrave;ches in the area just because there were geographically proximate cr&egrave;ches.  There is no obligation to assess the length of the waiting lists or the adequacy of provision.  That is something that could be tightened up as part of what is a great move and initiative in the two Bills towards a real quality of life and living.<br\/><br\/>I really want to support the shared equity scheme of the Bill.  I was one of those who got a foot on the property ladder as a result of the shared ownership scheme and was very glad to apply for it.  I got my loan approval while working in the voluntary sector on what were paltry wages.  In the week I got my loan approval, I could have bought a two-bedroom house in Crumlin for the money.  As a result of the speed at which house prices were rising at the time, within a fortnight, all I could afford was an apartment off St. James&rsquo;s Street.  I was delighted to have my apartment and it made a fine first home.  By the time it came to purchasing a full family home, we were among the Celtic tiger refugees who left Dublin and went to Kildare, which was fine, but we had a round trip of three hours a day.  I was fortunate that my family circumstances with my parents permitted the opportunity to combine our two homes so that I could move back to Dublin.<br\/><br\/>We were lucky.  Many have not been so lucky and, as a barrister working<i>pro bono<\/i>, I have represented such people.  Many had lost their homes and my role was to try to get a stay of execution, in terms of when they were obliged to move out, in order to facilitate a family member doing the leaving certificate, for example.  Those people must get a chance to be first-time buyers again and I appeal to the Minister to make sure they are included when he is making provisions in the context of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>It is reported in today&rsquo;s papers that young people exiting the care of the State need longer and more secure tenure.  I believe that supported sheltered housing projects, once termed foyer projects, have a real role in that care, as well as in care for the homeless.  I have been involved in building such projects.  I built a project with 55 independent units with own-door accommodation and supported structures.  It is currently run by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Foyer projects could be a game-changer in homelessness.  I urge the Minister to look at that again.  People such as Brendan Kenny are very much disposed to it.<br\/><br\/>I offer my congratulations to the Minister.  He is doing a fine job.  I thank him for his presentation to our parliamentary party last week.  He was very warmly welcomed and it was a real honour to have him there and to hear how much he listened to us.  It was a real symbol of our party moving forward in our determination and commitment to solve this housing problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#PPPP00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Ellistown still misses Senator Seery Kearney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#QQQQ00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I bet it does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#QQQQ00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>It is part of Kildare South.  Never before has a Government had to deal with such a difficult situation.  This must be the most difficult time ever to be in Cabinet.  There are many pressing social issues apart from the economic challenges and problems that the blows of Brexit and Covid have foisted on us.<\/p> <p>Above all, the most important thing is ensuring that people have a home.  I know that is the absolute priority for the Minister and our party and, of course, the Government.  We need a Minister who has vision and ambition and is pragmatic and practical.  I absolutely believe the Minister is that man and he is the one who can deliver.  It is very important that people have security of tenure and that they have it within a sustainable community.  That is really important because we cannot have houses being built without proper thought or planning in terms of how the families will live in those situations.  We must have adequate regard to schools, childcare, transport and leisure and amenity facilities.  Covid certainly taught us the importance of that when we could not venture more than 2 km or 5 km from our homes and then subsequently when we were restricted to travelling within our counties.  We also cannot have houses and apartments being built without due regard for safety.  We cannot have a quick fix solution.  Everything has to be considered and there has to be a long-term view in terms of the answers the Minister brings forward.<\/p> <p>I will refer briefly to the situation in Newbridge, where there was a dreadful fire at apartments in Millfield.  Thankfully, there was no loss of life, but we saw that the apartments were not built properly or appropriately because they were built during the Celtic tiger.  Also in Newbridge, a strategic housing development of almost 400 houses is being built but there are not enough school places, particularly for children with special needs or those who are going into secondary level.  In addition, the town is suffering gridlock.  I have spoken to the Minister before about the need for a second bridge.  I know Kildare County Council is engaging on that with his Department this week.  It is important that I raise that issue again because of the impact that will be caused by the extra 400 houses and possibly 800 cars, as well as the importance of the children who need all those extra supports.  It is important that they and Newbridge, as a community, have those supports.<\/p> <p>Dezoning is happening apace in Kildare, such as in Athy currently.  I question that because it has an impact on the affordability of houses.<\/p> <p>I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in respect of voids.  That was his first target on taking office as Minister ten months ago and its impact has been felt across the country.  In Kildare, 111 families have now been housed as a result.  We need to look at regenerational programmes that are going on.  For example, one such programme at St. Patrick's Park in Rathangan has been going on for more than ten years.  It is most frustrating for families that need homes to see homes that are owned by local authorities but are not in use.  I ask the Minister to look at that issue again.<\/p> <p>There are four very fine aspects to the Bill.  It is really important legislation which ensures that affordability is put at the heart of the housing system.  I congratulate the Minister in the context of the Bill being the first legislation in the State to focus solely on affordable housing for people who work but cannot afford a home.  I have family friends, neighbours and constituents in that position.  Young people in their 20s, 30s or even their 40s are not in a financial position to move out of their parents' homes.  They are being denied their rite of passage and their identity as independent persons.  I was in my 30s when I bought my first and only house and there is not a day when I do not feel gratitude when I put my key into the door of the house because buying the house was a challenge and a difficulty for me and I got in just before it all escalated.  I know what it is like and I empathise with the many people who are in that situation. <\/p> <p>I wish the Minister well.  We are with him every single step of the way and we will support every endeavour he takes to ensure that people of every age and from every stratum of society have a place they can call their own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#QQQQ00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

That is a commitment in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, which was prepared by all three parties in government.  It commits the Government to the mission of housing for all, that everybody should have access to good quality housing for purchase or rent at an affordable price and that the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes.  However, the State is not the only stakeholder in this regard.  In facing this challenge, we need innovation among all stakeholders to increase construction and we also need clear project management to implement these measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was reading a number of articles over the weekend and then went back to look at census 2016.  I realised we had a housing stock of 2 million homes and apartments.  Over 183,000 were vacant units, excluding vacant holiday homes.  I welcome the expansion of the repair and lease scheme from 40,000 to 60,000 but I would like to see an awful lot more dedicated to this area.  <br\/><br\/>I have rented and am still renting.  I have rented for many years in Dublin city centre and, as our Labour Senator was saying, I have rented and am renting again in Dublin north.  I know what it is like when one has to move home when landlords go into the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  I would like to see how we are using this.  When new regulations came in, developers and property owners did not develop their homes to respond to this.  There could be more in the repair and lease.  Investment firms are a small part, as I understand, of the overall housing market, holding less than 1% of all housing stock and 5% of tenancies.  Since 2016, under Rebuilding Ireland we have had nearly 85,000 new homes built by the end of this quarter.  I support integrated development and a mix of housing and we need to consider including recreational space and access to community services.<br\/><br\/>In my area of Ballinasloe, a number of developments have been approved for planning but none are moving forward.  Why is that?  We cannot find places to rent in Ballinasloe yet we are inundated with vacant areas on our streets.  We cannot get our construction and developers to move forward.  How do we do this?  <br\/><br\/>This Affordable Housing Bill contains the first scheme of direct State-built affordable homes in over a decade.  The State will take an equity stake and, all over the country, it will be between 160,000 and 310,000.  When the house is bought, the State will get its equity stake back.  The Minister has indicated it is &euro;310 million for the serviced sites fund, which will allow 6,200 units.  How will we move those forward this year?  There is a lot of difficulty at the moment in terms of coming out of lockdown.<br\/><br\/>It is the first national scheme to provide delivery of cost rental housing.  I have been renting in Dublin for many years.  I cannot believe I went back to Galway to rent and then went back to Dublin again.  It was a bit of a surprise to me.  In both Galway and Dublin cities, I have had to leave where I was renting, not by choice.  Although there are many who would like to take on renting as a choice, I do not believe the European model is the same here or that someone can rent a place and have security of tenure for 20 to 30 years.  That choice is not left to the tenant.  The Minister's scheme is very welcome, particularly that he will look at 25% below market price, considering that in Dublin 40% of the average wage is dedicated towards rent.  <br\/><br\/>There are regional price caps on the new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for homes and private development.  This is welcome.  It is important in our regional areas to keep towns and villages alive and maintain services.  That is crucial.  The town centre first strategy is also coming in here.<br\/><br\/>The provision for the extension of the Part V to 20% within each local authority.  As the Minister heard me say in our meeting, Galway County Council is the second lowest funded council in the country.  The average spend on housing is &euro;400, according to the <i>localauthorityfinances.com<\/i>website, developed by the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Yet in County Galway, it is &euro;80 per head.  That is a shocking statistic.  We need more supports within our local authorities.<br\/><br\/>My questions are on how we get construction moving and on resources for local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#QQQQ00700","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

Having worked directly with the Minister in the last D&aacute;il and sat through thousands of hours of committee meetings, I know his personal commitment to solving this complex issue and the energy, commitment, passion and drive he will bring to providing solutions.  Ten months after his appointment, we already see signs of the results on the ground: the largest capital investment in the history of the State and the continuing increase in the delivery of social housing in every town across the country.  There is currently a strong supply of social homes which needs to be maintained into the future.<\/p> <p>The reduction in homelessness is welcome but it remains stubbornly high.  The 40% reduction in family homelessness is significant and welcome.<\/p> <p>I am reminded of the saying that it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.  Covid might have helped in the provision of housing for these families, due to the increased availability of homes on the market.  When we return to the new normal, let us not return to the scenario where homeless families were forced to live in hotels and tourists were living in homes.  Additional legislation is needed to regulate the short-term letting platforms directly, as opposed to planning legislation.  I say this is from a tourist offering point of view and that of assisting in provision of homes for these families.<\/p> <p>The Bill before us is significant for individuals, couples and families, who are the forgotten people, left behind with no supports.  These people do not qualify for social housing, are forced to pay rental prices in excess of average mortgage repayments and have been left outside of Government housing policy for far too long.<\/p> <p>This legislation is the first in the history of the State to solely focus on affordability.  This ground-breaking legislation is proof of this Government's commitment to restoring affordability and the aspiration of owning a home to the centre of Irish housing policy.  The aspiration of home ownership is a core part of the basic social contract of Irish politics.  This basic aspiration runs deep in our troubled history.  As a people, we were dispossessed and economically disadvantaged.  The role of the hearth is at the centre of most Irish hearts.  This legislation starts the work of bringing that back into the centre of Government policy.  The Minister is not coming with a silver bullet because none exists.  He is providing through this Bill a number of options to deliver affordability.<\/p> <p>Much has been made of the shared equity scheme, in this House and nationally.  I question the narrative being promoted by the Opposition and others about this scheme as being politically motivated.  How surprised I am.  While I am not an economist, I have an understanding of how the economy works.  This scheme is clearly identified as a short-term measure while the other elements of the Bill are commenced.  It is currently capped at an investment of &euro;75 million, which forms less than 1% of the mortgage market of around &euro;11 billion.  I do not believe for a moment that this less-than-1% will influence the market.  This scheme is immediate and can deliver 2,000 homes this year, which means 2,000 families can be living in their home by the end of the year. <\/p> <p>The national cost rental scheme is another first for this Bill.  It is the first ever cost rental scheme delivering by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency, which is another Bill the Minister is bringing through the House at the same time.  It is tasked with delivering cost rental and affordable homes for our people.  The extended Part V, which reintroduces the 10% affordable clause, is welcome.  Local authority-led building of affordable homes is, without doubt, my preferred option and the potential long-term solution to providing affordable homes.  I fully support it.<\/p> <p>If we as a State are to understand the true depth of the housing crisis, the State must now take responsibility to establish the number of individuals, couples and families who qualify for these supports and immediately put in place a procedure to establish an affordable housing assessment process similar to the social housing process.  Then the State must bring the same commitment, energy, resources and support to this process that it has to social housing support.  We as a Government  and State are committed to delivering on our promise to provide families with an affordable home and the aspiration of owning a home once again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#RRRR00400","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge his great efforts in this really important topic of housing.

I welcomed the announcement by the Minister last week on Airbnb and his view that regulations should be introduced in that regard.  Regulation will free up the supply.  Supply is an issue in both urban and rural areas in my part of the world.  On the urban side, large parts of Kinsale and Clonakilty have huge Airbnb properties that are soaking up the rental supply.  In rural areas, there are houses occupied for three or four months of the year and vacant for the other eight.  The big issue is that people who live locally cannot even get planning permission.  They cannot even get access to the houses to which I refer.  There is a major issue regarding supply.<\/p><p>I would like to talk about the cost of building a house.  This is being lost in the debate at times.  I did a bit of research a while ago and rang a few individuals.  The cost per square foot of building a house today, including VAT, is around &euro;184.  That is exceptional.  It should be taken into consideration.  People were very blunt with me when I rang around.  Irish Water could charge up to &euro;8,000 per house.  The building regulations that were introduced have led to increase after increase.  Most houses now have heat pumps attached.  The cost is &euro;5,000 per pump.  An air ventilation system is another &euro;5,000 per house.  The cost of insulation alone has gone up by 30% in the past six months.  An average dwelling of roughly 2,000 sq. ft costs nearly &euro;400,000, and that is without a site.  This is the cost of building a house in today's environment.  It is only increasing.  Labour is a huge issue for our society.  We cannot get labourers.  Tradesmen are like gold dust.  We are following the US model in so many ways.  If one wants to make a fortune, one should become tradesmen.  It could be said that we are a victim of our own success.  Everyone wants to go to college.

The Father of the House is dead right.  Tradesmen, particularly those in the wet trades, such as the plasterers and block masons, are nearly impossible to get.  That is the core issue.  Before the boom, we had tradesmen and labourers coming in from abroad.  That is not happening now.  The support will have to come from our own society.  Tying it all together will be a huge issue in addressing the housing crisis.  It will also be an issue for construction.  This is important legislation but, in fairness to the Minister, it will not solve everything because there are so many dynamics that need to be solved.  Anyone who examines the cost and availability of labour will see that these are huge issues for us.<\/p> <p>The other issue I would like to raise concerns the powers of local authorities when it comes to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  The number of vacant properties in villages the length and breadth of Ireland is frightening.  The CPO powers of local authorities are amazing.  They have phenomenal powers that date back to an Act from the 1960s, I believe.  That Act is not being used effectively by the local authorities.  They need to come into that space more.  A former city manager in Cork City Hall, Mr. Joe Gavin, with whom I never worked, was probably the pioneer who used to Act to the fullest extent.  He achieved major movement in Cork in the 1980s.  We should use this Act in every town and village across the county.  We should be promoting the legislation and driving city and county managers to use it so they can get rid of derelict sites and address developments that need to be moved on.  It will be a genuine game changer if we can get movement in this space.<\/p> <p>To return to my primary argument, this is important legislation.  It will go a long way towards solving our problems but it is only a part of the solution.  We will get there but, realistically, it will be bit by bit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#SSSS00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

For me, housing is the biggest issue that our country faces.  Covid has been an inconvenient distraction from that but it has evolved the thinking on housing, community, quality of life, how and where we can work and, consequently, how and where we can live.  By restricting their movements, we restricted spending so more potential buyers have been able to save up deposits.  Both Covid and Brexit have affected building materials and costs and we face the knock-on effect of the closure of construction.  There is additional pent-up frustration on top of the pent-up frustration among those who want to move and start the next stage of their adult lives, which means putting down roots and finding a home.  We get to a point in our lives where, having found a good job or career and having found ourselves, we want to find a home.  Unfortunately, too many lives have been put on hold.<\/p> <p>Covid-19 has brought a new drive and localism, making the concept of the 15-minute city more achievable.  We need to deliver on that vision through the development of homes, community infrastructure and amenities together.  We have talked about this in Fingal County Council and here.  It is about providing homes but it is as much about providing for the communities they are in.<\/p> <p>The housing needs we are facing today are very different from those in 2011 and even from those before Covid.  As my colleague said, the challenges keep coming.  Therefore, we have to be flexible and change as they arise.<\/p> <p>Certain themes remain, however, one being homelessness.  I am glad to see the March report for homelessness numbers shows a decrease of 19%.  Family homelessness is down 38% and emergency accommodation demand is down by 75%   This is the lowest figure since June 2017 but it is not enough.<\/p> <p>With regard to supply, we have increased the number of homes being built by 300%, from 5,000 in 2012 to more than 20,000 in 2020.  We have made progress on social housing, with more than 10,000 homes having been supplied in 2019.  We have taken 30,000 families off the social housing waiting list over the past four years.  Again, however, Covid has taken its toll.  I acknowledge the 157 voids that will be refurbished in Fingal this year under the new local authority voids scheme and also the new projects that are starting in Fingal.<\/p> <p>On home ownership and affordability, the Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable quality housing is available to everyone.  The Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill are comprehensive.  The Affordable Housing Bill is the most comprehensive housing Bill in the history of the State.  Almost &euro;690 million will be put towards affordability measures, including a new affordable purchase shared-equity scheme, new cost-rental homes, Rebuilding Ireland home loans and an expanded help-to-buy scheme.  The Land Development Agency is another measure.  These developments are great.  I include the increase to 20% under Part V, which has really worked for us, to include social and affordable housing, with a social mix of at least 10%.  I echo what my colleagues have said about the importance of mixed development across the board.  We can see the benefits in our communities.  Also to be considered in this regard are the direct local authority build of affordable units, supported by a revamped serviced sites fund, and the affordable purchase scheme and the first-ever national cost-rental scheme, with more than 400 units built and occupied in the State, the cost being at least 25% less than the market value and 30% in some cases, with long-term tenure.  The shared equity scheme is to increase first-time buyers' purchasing power.  It is for people who cannot quite secure the full mortgage required.  It could help 2,000 potential owners this year.  It is a combination of all these measures that I hope will facilitate the change we need to see.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of building costs.  They are another barrier.  A builder told me recently that timber prices have gone up by 100% in the past six months and that steel has also gone up, by 50%.  I am told that factories and timber mills were closed during the first lockdown and that there is a knock-on effect from that.  It is also a matter of supply chains and Brexit.  One family I spoke to bought a house to renovate last year when they could see they could have a home office and better life, but now the cost of renovating that home has gone up by 60%.  With regard to factors such as the supply of skills and labourers, we have to be agile and on our toes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know the Minister and his team and the committee are all those things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#SSSS00500","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank all my colleagues for this very important debate on housing and its supply, which I welcome.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are in the middle of the biggest housing crisis ever to hit this State.  Like many in this House, I am sure, my phone is full of messages, phone calls and emails from those who are struggling to get the basic human right of a roof over their heads.  It is full of communications from young people setting out on their life's journey but who cannot get to even the first step on the property ladder.  It is full of communications from single people and older people who cannot get that one-bedroom home that might be affordable to them because such properties are, as recently described to me in conversation by a local council official, like gold dust.<\/p> <p>Into this situation we place the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 and the efforts of the Government to help those contacting me on my phone and, I am sure, as I said, on the message minders of all public representatives' phones.  The question I have for the Minister is why we are about to embark once again on relying in the main on the market to build homes.  Why are we turning to approved housing bodies and private investors to build and provide the homes that are needed?  I see, unfortunately, no real effort in this Bill to concentrate homebuilding through our local authorities and once again to build council houses.  In my county, Kildare, we have seen over recent weeks what happens when private forces are allowed to control the market.  One gets the birds of prey circling and outbidding the local authority in its desperate attempts to reduce the waiting lists and to provide for, in the case of County Kildare, the more than 6,500 people on the housing list.  I want to see a genuine attempt to restart the housebuilding sections of local authorities that were allowed to be wound down but I do not see it here.  I do not see any attempt to address the famous and indeed infamous four-stage process of building local authority homes that over recent years has frustrated and delayed county councils and their members to the point that many have now simply accepted the delays that such red tape brings and, in the opinion of many, have simply given up.  This is the frustration I get back when I speak to so many local authority members throughout the State.  I am sure this has been raised with the Minister.  Realistically, how long should a stage 1 process take?  In one case I am aware of I have been hearing this for almost four years.  Where is the political will to cut this red tape and build local authority houses once again?<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise with the Minister the urgent need to include and involve other agencies in this process and this crisis.  This was raised with him in the last debate here on this Bill.  I am aware of local authority land in many locations in my county where there are deficits in infrastructure.  There is publicly owned land in Nurney, County Kildare, which is sitting idle in an area where there is urgent need for social and affordable housing.  The lack of water services in the area will prevent this piece of land from ever being developed unless we involve other agencies.  The Government must involve agencies such as Irish Water in this crisis more.  It must prioritise infrastructural deficits such as those in Nurney in order to tackle this crisis head-on.  It must recognise that many other towns and villages have infrastructural deficits that will prevent houses being built in areas where these houses are needed most.<\/p> <p>One of the biggest issues when it comes to housing is the ongoing inability of those working on low incomes to afford their own homes.  I have dealt with so many families and individuals who were only a couple of hundred euro above the social housing income limit and were told time and again that housing officials have no discretion in this and that they only implement the limits set out by the Government.  There is an urgent need for an affordable housing scheme that will assist those taking home the incomes I have just described.  The Bill before us does not, in my opinion, define \"affordable\" and, as such, will not assist these young families and individuals at their hour of need.  As has been said, we all hope this is not the case.  The Bill could have been different.  It could have presented a definition that could provide hope and, more importantly, direction to our local authorities to assist those in this category.  We are already hearing about differing prices in different areas.  I am worried that those who are working and whose incomes are outside the social housing limits in my county will once again be left behind.<\/p> <p>I will finish by going back to the red tape I mentioned earlier.  I note and welcome the recent announcement by the Minister's Department on the upgrade of voids and getting them back into the social housing stock.  If we are genuinely serious about this crisis, then addressing the red tape and, more importantly, the length of time such voids take to return to the social housing stock and to become family homes must be addressed.  I know we are still in the midst of a pandemic, but in some cases in my area this work is taking years, and that is a crisis that is simply not good enough.  Housing is a huge issue for us all and we all want to see it working.  I look forward to further debate on the Bill as it goes through this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#TTTT00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  I thank him for coming to Fine Gael's parliamentary party meeting the other evening.  It was very informative and very positive and is something I would like to see more of across parties.<\/p> <p>Access to affordable housing is one of the most immediate and urgent challenges facing young people, middle income earners and families today in Ireland, including in my home county, Longford.  This Bill is about individuals and families who want to be able to rent their own homes and to aspire to own their own homes.  In the entirety of my county, Longford, there has been no development of any private houses in 12 years - not one private home built.  The Government takes the housing crisis extremely seriously, is taking action and is willing to deliver social, affordable and private housing via any mechanism possible.  It is willing to deliver what is most needed, and that is homes.  It is right that the State uses every available asset it has to support its citizens.  It is right that a combination of the Affordable Housing Bill, the Land Development Agency and budgets will provide affordable homes for decades to come.  For generations to come the legislation we are debating now will restore affordable home ownership.  That will be the norm in the future.<\/p> <p>This will not happen immediately, however, and will take time to bed in.  It is important we look at the repair and lease scheme, and I welcome the increase from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000 in respect of the limits on that.  We also need to bring in a range of tax incentives.  Senator Dolan mentioned earlier the 180,000 vacant houses in the 2016 census.  We need to unlock them, and whatever measures have to be put in place we need to put in place immediately.  Both Senators Currie and Lombard mentioned build costs.  This gets lost in the conversation.  People do not realise the high build costs there are.  There is a shortage of timber, which has been caused by individuals objecting to felling licences, and there has been an increase in the price of steel.  The price of glass has increased.  I spoke only the other day to an insurance company that has quoted a price of &euro;200 per square foot to cover the cost of a rebuild in my county, Longford.  This would have an average semi-detached heading for &euro;300,000, whereas ten years ago you could buy a three-bedroom semi-detached in Longford for about &euro;60,000.  Now we are looking at a minimum of &euro;250,000 to build that same house.<\/p> <p>I sincerely welcome the funding the Minister made available for the retrofit schemes for the voids and the houses in respect of which Longford County Council has issued CPOs.  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits the Government to building on the foundation of Rebuilding Ireland to deliver housing for all.  The document expresses the core belief that everybody should have access to good-quality housing for purchase or at an affordable rent.  I welcome the flexibility of the first-time buyer rule in the Bill for those who previously had a dwelling as part of a marriage that may have ended, those who sold or lost homes due to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings and those who are in homes that are too small for their current needs.  I welcome the standardisation of the scheme of priority for affordable purchase homes and the introduction of the 30% flexibility for local authorities to prioritise those who perhaps do not meet the standard criteria.  We also need to ensure, however, that a percentage of the affordable homes that are built be designed in a way that is appropriate to the needs of those with a disability.  That has not been mentioned very much.  Many disabled people long for independent living in appropriate housing.<\/p> <p>The second measure is cost-rental.  This targets specifically those whose earnings are above the income threshold for social housing and who are trapped in high-cost rental accommodation.  It is intended that cost-rental properties will involve long-term, secure tenancies.  This is based on the Vienna model, with rents charged to cover the cost of delivering, financing, maintaining and managing the homes.  As rents will be linked to the consumer price index, these homes will in fact get more affordable as time progresses.  I recently dealt with a case in my home county of a father whose marriage had broken up.  He is no longer in the family home, is struggling to pay rent and is just above the social housing income threshold because the maintenance he pays is not being taken into account as an expense.  We need to be able to do more for people all over the country who are in the same position.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to look after our youth.

I said some months ago that we would try to initiate as much legislation as we could in the Seanad.  I served in the Seanad before I served in the D&aacute;il.  Even though we are in the D&aacute;il Chamber, Senator Norris's presence raises the talent level of debates here as well.<\/p> <p>This Second Stage debate has been good.  It covered a lot of aspects of the Bill.  I ask those who have not looked at the Bill in detail to do so and to familiarise themselves with it because it is the most comprehensive piece of affordable housing legislation that has pretty much ever been published.  It takes in a wide range of views - not political views but there is a wide range of potential solutions to the problem of affordability.  If we all believe that a cohort has been locked out of home ownership and is paying rent at exorbitant rates, then we have to do something about it.  We all believe that a generation of people aspire to owning their own home or, indeed, want to have more secure tenures in rent.  To do that, we have brought forward very practical measures.<\/p> <p>I was appointed Minister at the end of last June and in the very beginning of July we started working on this legislation to see how we would work it though.  There are complexities to it.  It might require some changes on Committee Stage and I am open to all reasonable amendments.  However, I ask those who are opposed to the measures being introduced to come forward with real alternatives; not just with sound bites or throwaway remarks, but with real policies backed by real finance that will work.  It is incumbent on us all in the Oireachtas, in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il, among those of all parties and those of none, to address this crisis.  As Senator Chambers said earlier, this is bigger than a housing issue because it is a societal issue.  If people do not believe they have a future in the country with one of the most basic fundamental things of having a secure roof over their head, that is a major problem.  They will end up being exploited by others who may not want to see progress in housing because it does not suit them politically and does not suit their own political narrative.   Frankly, we should rise above that.  All parties have a responsibility to address the crisis.  <\/p> <p>A couple of Senators opposite mentioned task forces and what we need to do to bring certain things about.  I chair two task forces, one of which is on homelessness.  It has been mentioned here because someone having a safe and secure home is fundamental.  I do not wish to be complacent, but this Government has made progress, particularly in the area of child and family homelessness.  There has been a reduction of nearly 40% in less than 12 months, and 75% fewer families are using hotels as emergency accommodation.  There is no question that we need to do a lot more.  We are right in this country to be critical and self-critical but it is also important to recognise when progress is being made.  My focus as Minister will be on that cohort, working with Government colleagues who I had the pleasure of addressing at their own parliamentary parties last week.  I thank Senator Martin and my colleagues in Fine Gael for their kind words, and indeed my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am always open to people talking about solutions and what we need to do to work things through.<\/p> <p>This legislation must be looked at in the context of the overall housing package.  Senator Wall mentioned local authorities getting back building.  That is exactly what we are doing.  It takes time to build that capacity but the budget that this Government brought forward, which was opposed by the Labour Party, contained the largest housing budget in the history of the State - &euro;3.3 billion, with &euro;2.1 billion in capital.  There is a target of 9,500 brand new social housing builds.  We have actually changed the approval process.  I have encouraged all local authorities to use it.  It has been changed to a single approval up to &euro;6 million.  I would like to go further.  I am meeting the chief executives of all the local authorities from this Friday into next week because the Senator is right that we need to build the capacity there.  I have mentioned project management expertise at local authorities.  We are working on ensuring we have housing delivery teams in each of the local authorities.  We need to do that.<\/p> <p>On the social house building side, I am confident that through Housing for All, through the work we are all doing in the Oireachtas and through the programme for Government, we can push through social housing at scale.  As we do that, we need to look at new tenure in housing which many have mentioned, namely cost rental.  Cost rental and versions of it work very well in continental Europe.  We want to put it in place here.  Only last October, during budget negotiations, we secured the first &euro;35 million to be able to start cost rental.  It involves long-term rent, backed by the State, that covers the cost of building and maintenance of properties.  We set a threshold for the first eight schemes, and they will be in place within 12 months of the announcement in the greater Dublin area and in Cork.  The individual schemes will be announced.  That is the first and I hope there will be many more.  That is on top of the 50 cost-rental units in the pilot.  To give a sense of how long it can take to get things done in Ireland, and to demonstrate that we need to focus not only on policy but also on delivery, I should mention that the first 50 cost-rental units, on Enniskerry Road, were announced in 2015 but have not even been tenanted yet.  They will be tenanted this year and we will have a national cost-rental scheme.<\/p> <p>Those who support this legislation will be supporting cost rental for working people.  Those who oppose it will be opposing cost rental for working people.  That is what it gets down to.  We will build on it, as Senator Martin asked, and we will go much further.  This is the first year, and we have &euro;35 million in Exchequer funding backed by &euro;100 million by the Housing Finance Agency, with eight schemes in place.  We will move that on further.  Then we will look at how we can deliver affordable homes on State-owned land.  A very good concept during the last Oireachtas, which was agreed through the confidence and supply agreement, was the serviced site fund of &euro;310 million to deliver over 6,000 homes in that one cohort alone.  That is another thing that has been misrepresented by some in the Opposition who have said the target is only 6,000 affordable homes.  No, it is not.  We are talking specifically around the serviced site money of &euro;310 million.  With that, we will repurpose it to make a national affordable purchase scheme in order that our local authorities can be directly involved in building on their own land, as I assume everyone wants.  We want to be able to have housing for all those who are locked out, not only those on social housing waiting lists but those who are working as well.  Should they be precluded from being able to buy or own a house on public land?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is it only a certain section of society that has a right to anything on public land?  I do not agree with that fundamental belief.  We need to get on with delivery instead of these ideological debates back and forward where we are now looking at infamous pieces of land like Oscar Traynor Road, and Senator Wall has mentioned Nurney, County Kildare.  The Senator's colleagues in Dublin could have a look at how they voted on the Oscar Traynor Road proposal where we could have delivered hundreds of homes.  I will help the local authority to deliver that more quickly.  People need these houses and need to see that.<\/p><p>That is the affordable purchase element which will be done on State-owned land.  We need to do more of it and to give local authorities the ability to buy more land to do that.  Again that will be done.  Those who support this Bill support affordable purchase on State-owned land.  Those who vote against it do not.  That is what it is going to be come down to at this stage.<\/p><p>The third element we are looking at is shared equity.  Shared equity is very simply to enable a working person or couple to be able to bridge the affordability gap.  It was not opposed by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in any way, shape or form and we have calibrated our scheme in a very focused way to those who need it who will only be able to get the requisite equity amount based on their own income.  This will be targeted at around 2,000 households per annum.  That is in addition to the other 6,000 households, and it works.  A comparable scheme, not the same one, in Britain delivered a 14% increase in supply with less than a 1% increase in the house price index, HPI.  That is based on the UK equivalent of the Comptroller and Auditor General report, and not on any other report.  We all generally hear of and support our Comptroller and Auditor General and his work in the Oireachtas.  Let us not twist this in any other way and say it was increased.  Our scheme is going to be different.  It is calibrated and there are price caps based on regions.  Those price caps, by the way, are not targets, they are caps and like in any area there are variations in prices within that area.  Fundamentally, this will give people an opportunity to buy and own their own home this year or else, what is the alternative?  They can sign up to continuing to pay rent at an exorbitant rate for another number of years while trying to save every cent they have or they can live with their folks well into their 30s or even their 40s trying to save.  No, these are immediate solutions that can be tweaked as we move on.  If the Members support this Bill, they support the opportunity for young and not so young people to be able to get on the housing ladder where the State will take a very small equity at a very low rate of interest with no obligation to buy that out.  If Members do not support this Bill they do not support this measure.  It is as simple as that.  <\/p><p>We have got to get to a stage whereby we are bringing in the legislative blocks to enable that supply to increase.  All of these measures are supply-side ones.  On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il - I flagged this on Second Stage - I will be bringing forward the increase in the Part V provision.  As Members will know, in every new estate 10% of the houses will be set aside for social housing and it will be absolutely protected.  I will be bringing in an additional 10% in respect of affordable houses.  That will be brought in on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and brought back to colleagues in the Seanad for Report and Final Stages.  <\/p><p>I do not intend to use all of my time allocation this evening but suffice it to say that across the parties there have been some very relevant and good points made.  We will open to looking at amendments that are tabled.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will be here on Friday for a portion of the debate because the Cabinet is also meeting on Friday morning.  There is no disrespect to the House intended but I will not be here for part of Committee Stage but as soon as I can be back in, I will be.<\/p><p>There are other elements on the general housing side, in the area of voids, building cost, and other items which are very relevant but are not specifically relevant to this Bill and I have taken specific notes of each of them.  These are areas that we are very much looking at, such as the vacant housing stock across the country and what we can do to activate that stock.  We are certainly looking at how we can help people where we may have a lease and repair scenario and at how we may potentially help people to be able to buy those vacant homes that are there.<\/p><p>I genuinely thank all colleagues for their contribution and co-operation here this evening as we bring this Bill through the Seanad.  I look forward to engaging with colleagues on Committee Stage later in the week and, indeed, early into next week and I thank the Acting Chairperson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#UUUU00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire and I thank him for his time.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, to the House and thank him for coming to debate the Bill.  I also thank colleagues on all sides of the House who have expressed such strong support for this important Bill.  I really appreciate it, and I speak on behalf of Senator Sherlock and all the Labour Party Senators when I say how much we welcome that cross-party support.  I understand the Government has indicated it will not oppose the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.  We are very appreciative of that and many people watching the debate, who may have been affected by the issues we are going to discuss, will really appreciate it too.  We look forward to working with the Minister of State and his colleagues in government to make the Bill a reality and bring its provisions into law.  I welcome, in particular, my colleague Senator Norris, who has long been a champion of women's reproductive health.  I thank him, along with all the other Senators who intend to speak to the Bill.<\/p><p>In 2019, long before Covid had arisen, I was approached by my Labour Party colleague Councillor Alison Gilliland, who is also an official of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO.  She approached me because several members of the INTO had expressed concern about having to take time off work to undergo <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation, IVF, treatment or other reproductive treatments, or to take time off work having suffered an early miscarriage, and had not been able to acknowledge that nor had any formal recognition of that in the workplace.  A survey the INTO carried out in 2019 found that 60% of respondents had faced reproductive health difficulties in their workplaces.  This was clearly an issue for its members.  They passed a motion at their annual conference and approached me and my Labour Party colleagues to seek assistance in introducing this measure into law.<\/p><p>We became conscious that there was a glaring absence in our statutory leave laws and workplace protection laws in that for women who suffer the grief of an early miscarriage, or any women or men who have to take time off work to access IVF or other fertility treatments, there is no provision for leave in law.  Indeed, they currently have to take annual leave, sick leave or unpaid days in order to attend appointments or to recover physically and emotionally from an early miscarriage.  Some women members of the INTO reported having returned to work immediately after an early miscarriage because they had no entitlement to leave.<\/p><p>Having worked on the Bill for some time, on 2 March this year my fellow Labour Party Senators and I published legislation to provide statutory leave to those suffering early miscarriage or needing time off for IVF treatment.  The structure we used was to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act and use that statutory framework.  I am conscious that we could have gone down a different route and used the employment equality legislation or the maternity protection legislation, but we believed this was the appropriate framework.  Nevertheless, we are happy to work with the Government at a later stage if a more appropriate legislative framework is found.  We just want some mechanism for employees to be able to take leave and get formal recognition in the workplace.<\/p><p>This is not a uniquely Irish issue.  As it happens, in late March this year, the Labour Party of New Zealand, under Jacinda Ardern, passed very similar legislation to provide for leave for employees who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth.  The debate around our Bill, and internationally around the New Zealand law, has ignited a conversation about the need to face up to the complexity of fertility and reproductive health issues, and the need for the State to provide practical recognition for the role it plays in employees&rsquo; lives.  Since we published the Bill, my Labour Party colleagues and I have been contacted by many women and couples who have endured the grief and bereavement of early miscarriage, often in silence, or who have gone through multiple cycles of IVF and fertility treatment, and who have felt that there was nobody to whom they could turn within the workplace and no formal space in our law for their grief to be recognised.<\/p><p>It has been heartbreaking to hear some of the stories.  On Wednesday evening last, we organised a Labour Party Instagram Live event attended by individuals including S&iacute;le Seoige, the well-known broadcaster, and Clodagh O'Hagan, who has spoken about her positive experience in the workplace.  S&iacute;le spoke about her personal experience of suffering miscarriage and having to go straight back to work afterwards, without any formal acknowledgment.  We also heard from Claire Cullen-Delsol of the Termination for Medical Reasons group about the trauma of many of its members in suffering pregnancy loss and, again, having no formal recognition of that in the workplace.  We heard from all the speakers how important it is that their experiences be given recognition in our law.  Clodagh O'Hagan's experience with a very supportive employer was, for us, an indication of what could be done, a positive story of good practice where an employer was understanding and voluntarily provided her with time off.<\/p><p>If enacted, the Bill will provide women with up to 20 days' leave for early miscarriage and give an entitlement to all employees of up to ten days' leave for access to reproductive healthcare treatment, such as IVF.  We have been working since the publication of the Bill to ensure it has cross-party support and I again thank all the colleagues who have expressed their support for it.  We have also been contacted by individuals and groups on a number of related issues, which might well be the subject of amendments at later Stages of the debate on the Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, we have been approached about the need to introduce an opt-in scheme to provide recognition for stillborn babies, who are not covered by the current legislation.  Other issues that were raised with us include the need for greater understanding for women experiencing health difficulties due to menopause.  This has been a subject of immense debate and discussion on Joe Duffy's \"Liveline\" show in recent weeks.  For me and others of my age, it is a very pertinent subject and, again, one about which very little has been spoken until now.  For a long time there has been a culture of silence that many women have talked about with us since we published the Bill, which has extended to so many facets of women's health, including abortion, periods or menstruation, endometriosis and all sorts of conditions and women's experiences that to us are normal and regular parts of our lives, but that had not been discussed in the public forum until recently.  We see this Bill as being very much part of the spectrum of measures to try to break the taboo and culture of silence.  It is anticipated therefore that passing this simple Bill will help to break the culture of silence and fulfil a secondary function of destigmatising pregnancy and fertility treatment in the workplace and in society.  So many people currently suffer in silence, particularly women, because they do not believe the support is there for them.<\/p><p>Before I hand over to my colleague, Senator Sherlock, I will outline the broader context we should all remember, which is that approximately 14,000 women in Ireland suffer a miscarriage each year.  That is why I say it is almost a normal experience or certainly a very frequent one, sadly, for many women.  More than one in five pregnancies ends in a miscarriage.  Between one in four and one in six couples encounters difficulty in becoming pregnant.  The success rate for patients at certain IVF clinics can be very low.  The majority of IVF clinics in Ireland are very expensive, costing between &euro;4,500 and &euro;5,000 per cycle.  We are very conscious of the immense burden on so many people undergoing what some women describe to me as their fertility journey.  We welcome the immense support for this Bill on a cross-party basis and the Government's support.  We look forward to it passing through Second Stage and to working with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and colleagues to make it a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#XXXX00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much for coming to the Chamber this evening.  I am very proud that my party, the Labour Party, is bringing forward this Bill, which seeks to introduce paid leave for those suffering early miscarriage or those who are going through fertility treatment.  I am delighted to second the Bill.<\/p> <p>I pay particular tribute to my colleague, Senator Bacik, for spearheading this legislation.  It is one of many in the area of women's rights as workers, women's health and human rights that she has introduced since becoming a Senator.  Great credit must also go to her colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, and the INTO, for speaking out about these issues and prompting us to introduce the Bill.<\/p> <p>Many women are looking on at this debate tonight who cannot bring themselves to talk openly about what they are going through right now or what they have gone through in the past.  We stand with them.  Many of us in the Chamber tonight have been in those shoes and have gone through that heartache.  For those of us who have been through a miscarriage or fertility treatment, we know the secrecy, sadness and pressure to keep things looking normal on the outside even if we are falling apart inside.  We also know that very raw desire for privacy at a time when a woman can feel so vulnerable.  We want to protect ourselves in a world where so many others can seemingly so easily get pregnant and stay pregnant and we want to prevent others from talking about us in piteous tones.<\/p> <p>The experience of miscarriage is a hugely overwhelming one for the women who go through it.  Notwithstanding all our knowledge about the statistics and knowing in advance that it can so easily happen, there is a crushing feeling of inadequacy and intense sadness for those who find out that they have fertility issues and that one of the most natural things in the world &ndash; to be able to make a baby &ndash; is somehow out of reach.  Our Bill is to say to them, and to those other women who have decided to undertake fertility treatment alone so that they can have a baby, that in whatever circumstances they find themselves, it is time that we afforded them dignity and empathy in those situations.  In our workplaces, the time has come to recognise, respect and accommodate what they are going through in a dignified manner, if that is what they want and if they need to take off time to deal with what is going on in their life that they can get it, that the State will provide all workers in those situations with the provision of paid leave.  This is not a sickness and workers should not have to hide behind annual leave or to be forced to take it.  Our call is that workers are respected and recognised for what they are going through.  Reproductive health leave must be recognised as a worker's right.<\/p> <p>At the heart of this Labour Party Bill is a demand for flexibility and the right to be accommodated when going through an early miscarriage or fertility treatment.  Our Bill calls for 20 days paid leave for those suffering early miscarriage and ten days leave for those undergoing fertility treatments.  It is important to understand what a woman has to go through if she is undertaking IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI.  It is not a case of an initial assessment and then a once-off procedure.  It is a very delicate balancing act of inducing the ovaries through self-medicated, injected medication that is only possible at certain times of the month, being monitored over at least four scans and then, if all goes smoothly, egg collection can take place under anaesthetic.  More time is then required before moving to an embryo transfer.  All of that can take place over six to eight appointments, if it goes smoothly, or in the experience of so many, it can take many weeks and months.<\/p> <p>If we put ourselves in the shoes of a teacher, health professional or retail worker, anybody working in a customer-fronting or client-fronted service, it is not possible to start work two hours later than normal after a woman has gone for her early morning scan; neither is it feasible to disappear for two or three hours in the middle of the day, time that could perhaps be made up later if one was in another job.  Whatever one's workplace or role, the need for any worker to attend regular scans and blood tests is all part and parcel of fertility treatment and flexibility and understanding is required on the part of an employer.  Where women have felt that they could speak up, some employers have been magnificent, but many other women feel they cannot.  We very much hope that bringing forward this Bill will enable women to find their voice and say that they are going through this process and that they need understanding.<\/p> <p>I hope this Bill is the first of a series of steps that need to be taken in supporting assisted reproductive technology and therapies and State-support for fertility treatment in this country.  For six years we have had commitments by parties in government to introduce State support for IVF.  I will never forget February 2016 when Fine Gael said it would introduce IVF if re-elected.  That is not to have a go at Fine Gael or any other party, but I recall that day so well because my heart soared, as I know many couples and women who want to access the treatment but simply cannot because of the enormous cost.  Senator Bacik talked about the cost, which can go as high as &euro;10,000.  I was one of the lucky ones: we managed to move heaven and earth so that I could have my shot and it eventually worked, but for many others there is the heartache of knowing that help is possible, as there have been incredible advances in science and medicine to help women become pregnant or freeze their eggs, but that help is out of reach because of the cost.  Such help was not available to previous generations and it is available now, but only for those who go private.  What is all the more galling is that medication for fertility treatment is covered under the drugs payment scheme and one can get tax relief for it, but if one cannot get in the door of a fertility clinic because of the cost of treatment then one is not going anywhere.  Six years on from the initial commitment I accept there has been some little progress in terms of talk of regional hubs and funding, but we are not there yet.  Ireland is the only EU country that does not have supports in place for fertility treatment.  I thank the Government for its support on this Bill tonight.  It means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to the other women who are looking in on the debate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We ask that the Government move speedily on this because we cannot keep women and couples waiting.

I greatly appreciate it.  I pay tribute to my good friend and colleague, Senator Bacik.  She has been involved in issues of human rights over many years.  She has been particularly involved in women's rights, although not exclusively.  There is nothing narrow about Ivana.  I am very glad the Bill has been accepted by Government.  It is a very positive move and shows the way in which Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and the Oireachtas generally, can collaborate with Government.  Several of my close friends have endured this situation, which is extraordinarily traumatic.  As a man, I cannot imagine what it must be like to be pregnant for several months and to look forward to this joyful occasion only to find that, at the end, there is a dead baby.  It must be really shocking.<\/p><p>The Bill is important in the context of the Irish culture.  We talk so often about cherishing the children of the nation equally.  This is an opportunity for us to do so.  It has already been stated, possibly by Senator Bacik, that 14,000 women in Ireland have a miscarriage every year.  That is a very large number and should give us pause for thought.  I believe it was on 21 March 2021 that the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation allowing paid bereavement leave for workers who miscarry a pregnancy.  Who can deny that a miscarriage is a bereavement?  Of course it is.  <\/p><p>The Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, has publicly welcomed the publication of the Bill.  As Senator Bacik has acknowledged, the Bill itself, to a certain extent, stems from the prodding of the INTO.  We in this House have cause to remember with great affection and respect Joe O'Toole, who was head of the INTO for some years.<\/p><p>It is also important to hear the human voice behind these matters.  I have selected a couple of letters from women who have been affected by this issue.  The first says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDuring IVF treatment I travelled to Dublin leaving at 5am to have early appointment so that I would be back in work for 10am.  Thankfully I was lucky but the huge amount of unnecessary stress I put on myself, in hindsight, was ridiculous. <\/blockquote> <p>It is appalling that someone had to get up at 5 a.m. to travel to Dublin.  The next letter says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI didn&rsquo;t want to take school days but when you&rsquo;re dealing with fertility it becomes cycle dependent.  In the end I had to tell my principal because I couldn&rsquo;t deal with the stress and stress just makes the situation worse.  <\/blockquote> <p>A third letter reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI do not have a permanent job and would feel that telling my principal that I was going for fertility treatment would stand against me in any future job interviews.  I find this quite stressful as I would much rather be upfront about why I need the time off. <br \/><br \/>I had to go to the UK for an operation because there was no expert in Ireland to operate on me.  I had to be off work longer to recover but I had to go back sooner than I wished because I couldn&rsquo;t afford to go unpaid anymore.  <\/blockquote> <p>Could there be a better illustration of the absolute necessity for financial support for women in this situation?  The final extract I will read says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI&rsquo;m so worried about using a lot of sick days with my IVF.  Its already a nightmare to have to go through IVF.  This is adding to it.  I will be waiting until July to try another round of it as afraid of sick days, but my husband worried we are letting precious months slip by.  <\/blockquote> <p>That is the thing; one is fighting against the clock.  I commend Senator Bacik on introducing this very important legislation.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#ZZZZ00300","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Crowe, whom I thank for his courtesy to Senator Norris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#ZZZZ00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Not at all.  I welcome this topic here this evening.  It is an issue I raised myself last year and one I certainly want to see Government advance.  It is also welcome that the Government is not opposing the Bill.<\/p> <p>For too long families have suffered in silence, being forced to use personal leave as they come to grips with a tragedy.  Research suggests one in four women has suffered a miscarriage and the vast majority of these tend to happen in the early stages, before the 24-week mark which is currently the point from which leave is provided for by legislation in Ireland and many other countries.  We also know, as two Senators have already pointed out, that up to 14,000 women a year suffer a miscarriage in Ireland, which is frightening.  The current legislation which regards the 24-week point as a landmark in Ireland and other countries makes little sense.  Parents suffer an enormous loss and an enormous tragedy regardless of the week in which it happens.  We need to provide for special leave in this tragic scenario so that people are not required to use their ordinary sick leave, which I understand is what currently happens in many cases.  The Government supports this but wants to ensure it is done in an appropriate manner.<\/p> <p>We also know that as many as one in six heterosexual couples in Ireland encounters fertility difficulties.  Again, this is an issue with which people tend to struggle in silence.  These issues are clearly common but they are also incredibly challenging and it is important not to lose sight of that.<\/p> <p>The Government says that the introduction of any additional form of compassionate or family leave would require detailed legislative provisions as to the circumstances in which the leave entitlement would arise and may give rise to consequential amendments to existing legislation.  The legislation would need to provide for a detailed definition of certain medical terminology and the circumstances in which leave for reproductive purposes would apply.  For example, would the leave only apply to the employee undergoing the treatment?  It would also be necessary to clearly define the circumstances in which pregnancy loss or reproductive health interventions are more appropriately matters for sick leave and medical care.  Development of legislation of this nature would require significant policy development across a number of Departments.<\/p> <p>There are also a number of specific issues with the Private Members' Bill, as drafted.  The proposed new section 23(B)(1) to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that an employee shall be entitled to 20 days' leave with pay from his or her employment \"where the employee has miscarried a child having a gestational age of 28 weeks or less\".  This wording, in its current form, would not appear to provide for leave for both partners, which I presume is the intention.  It is also unclear why the Bill proposes leave with pay when a miscarriage occurs before 28 weeks gestation given that the existing entitlements to maternity and paternity leave apply to a stillbirth after 24 weeks.  The Bill proposes 20 days paid leave for miscarriage and ten days for reproductive healthcare treatment, which is significant.  This would also effectively result in an inconsistency in that a worker would have a right to receive a month&rsquo;s pay from the employer in the event of a miscarriage but would have no statutory right to pay from an employer for maternity leave in the event of the birth of a child where the State pays for that maternity leave.  As the Bill proposes a statutory right to significant levels of paid leave, a full regulatory impact assessment would need to be undertaken before this legislation is progressed.<\/p> <p>Having said that, I believe all Members in this House are united in the view that progress needs to be made in these areas during the life of this Government.  I suggest we work together to ensure that progress is achieved.  Perhaps we could start by inviting the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, into the House to hear his views and the plans of the Department and to create urgency to ensure the actions required are taken within the lifetime of this Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ollie Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Finally, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, to the Chamber and I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#ZZZZ00500","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  I thank Senator Bacik for bringing this Bill before the House tonight and for her contribution.<\/p> <p>It is staggering that 14,000 women every year suffer from miscarriage.  Everyone knows someone who has gone through it and normally the person is a family member.  The only reason we know she is a family member is because if it is not a family member, we do not necessarily talk about it.  It could be a mother or sister.  Perhaps one of the advantages of this Bill, or one like it, coming through is the opportunity for people to speak out about their experiences.  While I touch on that, I wish to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Sherlock.  We find the most empowering contributions in the Chamber are normally about personal experiences.  I hope the contribution Senator Sherlock made encourages more people to speak up and speak out about their experiences.<\/p> <p>There has been much talk and debate in recent weeks since the Parliament of New Zealand passed the Holidays (Bereavement Leave for Miscarriage) Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2021 in March, providing an entitlement to mothers and their partners of three days of paid leave following a miscarriage or stillbirth.  This entitlement is an extension of the existing statutory bereavement leave.  New Zealand now provides three days' leave for women and their partners who lose a baby at any stage in pregnancy.  Prospective parents will also be eligible if the mother of the baby they were hoping to adopt suffers a miscarriage.  This new law mandating three days of paid bereavement leave is distinct from sick leave or maternity leave.<\/p> <p>It is important to allow the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, to commission research to examine the context of the provision of the reproductive health leave, including how leave can be best used to support reproductive health needs.  The introduction of any additional form of compassionate or family leave would require detailed provisions on the circumstances in which the leave entitlement would arise and may give rise to consequential amendments to existing legislation.  It is also necessary to define clearly the circumstances in which pregnancy loss or reproductive health interventions are more appropriately matters for sick leave and medical care.  Development of legislation of this nature requires significant policy development across several Departments.<\/p> <p>The Bill proposes leave with pay when a miscarriage occurs before eight weeks' gestation.  It should be noted that existing entitlements to maternity and paternity leave apply to stillbirth after 24 weeks.<\/p> <p>There have been recent reforms for working parents.  We have seen an additional three weeks for paid parent's leave to each parent to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.  All adopting couples will be able to choose which parent may avail of adoptive leave, including male same-sex couples who were previously precluded due to a legislative anomaly.  Parent's leave will be made available to a parent who is not availing of adoptive leave.  The extension to the Parent's Leave and Benefits Act 2019, following several recent legislative reforms aimed at enabling working parents to spend more time with their children, was welcome.  The other reforms include the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks for a child under 12 years in 2020, the introduction of two weeks of parent's leave in 2019 and the introduction of two weeks of paternity leave in 2016.<\/p> <p>The Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021 removes the presumption that an adoptive mother be the primary caregiver and permits families to choose the best option.  It allows greater flexibility to adoptive parents and for the availability of parent's leave to parents not availing of adoptive leave.<\/p> <p>This is on the back of a range of measures that have been brought forward while Fine Gael has been in government.  In 2011, the Fine Gael-led coalition, along with the Labour Party, established the first Department with responsibility for children, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Following that the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, was established.  Free general practitioner care for all children under six years of age was introduced in 2015.  In 2016, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, launched the first national maternity strategy.  The strategy had four overarching priorities: to improve safety and quality in general and standardise care across all units; to introduce a health and well-being approach to give babies the best start and improve the health of women; to ensure a woman's choice is facilitated to the greatest extent possible; and to improve staffing levels of all facilities in maternity units in communities.  A great deal has been done by this Government and previous governments, including when the Labour Party was in government with us.<\/p> <p>Something like this or something along this line would add value to what has been introduced previously and would recognise the trauma that 14,000 women and their partners and families go through every year.  It is not acceptable that people have to use annual leave in private and not even say why they are taking it.  They simply take it and do not talk about it.  They do not have the opportunity.  They do not have that compassion from the State to be able to take bereavement leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#AAAAA00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I support this Bill.  Anything that assists any of our citizens who are in need of assistance, be it financial, social, emotional or spiritual, in respect of their health needs deserves our support.  I supported the principle behind the Labour Party period products legislation some months ago and had planned to speak on that, but I had to travel home to Galway for family reasons at the time.  We should always extend whatever reasonable resources are available to any citizen who has a particular medical need that he or she is unable to meet.<\/p> <p>The Bill reflects and recognises the strong sense of emotional and physical loss that can occur when a pregnancy is lost through miscarriage.  Whether it occurs naturally or is induced or procured, the end of a pregnancy is a traumatic event for a woman.  Every miscarriage is different and no two women or sets of parents will respond in the same way to their circumstances, but I believe what I have said represents the situation of the great majority.<\/p> <p>I strongly support leave being extended to women who require particular treatment related to their pregnancy or after childbirth as envisaged by section 5.  The country needs to do far more for expectant mothers and mothers in the early months after they give birth.  Their needs have been totally lost in a political system that has consumed itself in recent years debating how to end pregnancies instead of supporting pregnant mothers and their children.<\/p> <p>I do not subscribe to the narrative that we have always had a culture of silence around these issues.  I grew up in a context where there were no such taboos.  We often do down our country.  Certainly, cultures change and patterns change, but it can be something of a myth to say we have always had a culture of silence about these things.  Many people in our country and abroad were ready to discuss these things.<\/p> <p>I have three questions about this legislation.  Would it bring about an anomalous inequality?  I am asking the question in a constructive spirit.  The Bill grants leave to any woman who has a miscarriage up to 28 weeks.  I support that; there is no reason to oppose it.  Yet, would it be strange for the Oireachtas to legislate for this when we consider that, as the law currently stands and as the law will stand if the Bill is enacted, if a woman's husband, partner or child dies, she is entitled to no statutory leave of any kind.  In that instance the woman would be relying purely on the compassion of her employer, the terms of her employment contract or perhaps on the custom and practice in the sector in which she works to get leave on foot of the bereavement.  While I welcome the specific proposal I wonder whether it would be strange to introduce statutory compassionate leave for the loss of a pregnancy without also granting such leave for the loss of a spouse, infant child or older child.  Is the loss of a pregnancy worse to a mother or a couple than losing a spouse or child?  For many women, it would of course be an equal trauma but I do not believe anyone would contend it would cause more grief or physical trauma than the loss of a spouse or child.  For that reason perhaps the legislation could be said to jump the gun.<\/p> <p>A second issue relates to section 5 which would allow leave where the employee has \"miscarried a child having a gestational age of 28 weeks or less\".  I welcome the wording of that section because it clearly refers to there being a child in the first 28 weeks of pregnancy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It does not state miscarried a clump of cells, blastocyst, piece of tissue or any other offensive term.  It states &quot;miscarried a child&quot;.  This Bill explicitly recognises the humanity of every unborn child up to 28 weeks and we should all welcome that.  This is a fact that is unanimously agreed by doctors and scientists alike but it has often been disputed in this House and elsewhere for reasons of political dogma.  The word &quot;child&quot; is not once mentioned in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  This was a deliberate decision.  It was part of and in pursuit of a separate tragic development in our policy and law.  I am glad to see it explicitly recognised in section 5 of this Bill that every pregnancy up to 28 weeks is about a child.  I welcome that.  <br\/><br\/>However, I am concerned about a potential ambiguity in respect of the word &quot;miscarriage&quot;.  Broadly speaking, miscarriages happen in two circumstances - those that occur naturally, which are the majority, and those intentionally induced.  It is clearly intended that reproductive leave should apply to miscarriages that occur naturally but is it also intended to apply to miscarriages that are medically induced under the 2018 legislation?  Both the Bill and the explanatory memorandum were removed from the Oireachtas website over the weekend for some reason so I had to rely on the version of the Bill that was available on the Labour Party website.  Senator Bacik's accompanying press release avoids the point but does state several times that the Bill applies to &quot;early miscarriage or other reproductive health-related reasons&quot;.  I wonder whether it is within the definition of &quot;miscarriage&quot; under section 23B(1)(<i>a<\/i>) or whether it relates to treatment from a registered medical practitioner in the State and is intended to include abortion.  I am very happy to give way to Senator Bacik if she wants to clarify that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#AAAAA00300","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I will respond at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#BBBBB00200","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>The point is the Bill is ambiguous to say the least.

I would appreciate clarification from the sponsors of the Bill as to what they envisage and what they understand the Bill is providing for in this regard.<\/p> <p>From 24 weeks, a miscarriage is regarded as a stillbirth and 26 weeks maternity leave is available along with further unpaid leave but this Bill provides for leave up to 28 weeks.  Is there an anomaly in this regard?  What happens where it relates to a pregnancy that miscarries or a stillbirth between 24 and 28 weeks?  Is it envisaged that both benefits would be availed of?

I have already let them know of my support on this issue.  When the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth was here previously, I said that I would be supportive.  I must disagree with Senator Mullen.  I think there is a taboo around women's healthcare.  The life of a woman is wonderfully diverse and changes much more than the life of a man and we do not recognise that in our workforce.  We do not really take on board the fact that 50% of the workforce does have that variety and that different life course.  This means that we must have legislation that reflects that.  I have stood up here previously in respect of the menopause.  I believe there are opportunities to ensure that people can take leave and do not have to call it sick leave either because it is not necessarily that one is being sick.<\/p><p>To go back to the issue, which Senator Mullen may have diverted us from, I know very few women who have not been through either problems with conceiving or have not had miscarriages and most people are silent on it.  There is a culture where people are quiet for the first 12 to 14 weeks waiting to see how it goes.  This is because we are all waiting to see whether this life we envisage and expect for ourselves follows through.  This is because we know.  We did not need any statistics to tell us it is one in five.  It is probably closer to one in four.  We do not need statistics to tell us it is the experience of women.  The women with whom I speak do not tell their employers that they have suffered a miscarriage and they do not necessarily tell their doctors either.  In some cases, it is incredibly painful and women are left to their own devices.  I was thinking about <i>force majeure<\/i>leave and how the partner of a person going through miscarriage could be entitled to three days leave in certain circumstances but the person going through the physical experience of miscarriage is not entitled to leave so it does need to be dealt with.  That is correct not in every case but certainly in some cases.  The woman is using her entitlement to sick days and her partner may not be in certain circumstances.  <\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is considering carrying out research because there are a number of other issues we need to examine.  Some Senators have spoken about the anomalies in this legislation, which I am sure are recognised, such as whether it is 24 or 28 weeks but one way or another, it must still be dealt with.  India and New Zealand provide leave but just because they are the only countries that have it does not mean that it is the wrong thing for every country in the world.  This is one situation where we do not have to wait to be called out but can step up to the mark and really give women the support they need.  If one looks at the list of the type of leave, there are other circumstances.  Deputy Costello raised the issue of leave for foster parents so this must be looked into.  We need a sense of equality at the end of this.  As has been outlined by Senator Ahearn, the Minister has addressed anomalies.  We need to make sure we have legislation that does not have those anomalies because everyone needs to be treated fairly regardless of their family background or type and whether they are going through the pregnancy themselves or somebody else on their behalf.  <\/p><p>I very much welcome the legislation.  There is work to do on it and, therefore, t is important that we have that research but we are talking about these very personal and sensitive issues now.  It is really important because we are public representatives and it is our job to talk about these things and bring them to light.  I thank the Labour Party very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#BBBBB00400","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is manifold.  It is to ensure leave of 20 working days for those who have experienced a miscarriage and leave of ten working days for people in respect of assisted human reproduction such as IVF.  It is also designed to create awareness and discussion about the impact of miscarriage in a compassionate and considerate way and to put a belated focus on miscarriage and reproductive health, which is often shrouded in silence with so many people suffering as a result.<\/p> <p>The Bill's intent dovetails with that of the Miscarriage Association of Ireland&rsquo;s mission, which is to &ldquo;increase awareness in the general public that all pregnancy loss is a bereavement and the length of the pregnancy is not related to the depth of the grief and sense of loss experienced\".  Legislators and employers have a responsibility to those women affected by these circumstances to act appropriately when necessary.  Last November, Sinn F&eacute;in brought a Bill to the D&aacute;il to reform the Organisation of Working Time Act to protect workers.  The Bill sought provision of a statutory entitlement to paid leave to acknowledge the challenges workers face when trying to escape an abusive relationship.  We need a whole-of-society response that both supports and protects women.  Today&rsquo;s Bill is aimed a creating a compassionate environment in which workers are protected and supported and have better working conditions. <\/p> <p>A miscarriage, whatever time it occurs, in the cycle of a pregnancy is a traumatic experience.  It is a deeply personal loss and requires recognition that a potential life has been lost for reasons that many parents and their partners, friends and work colleagues may have difficulty understanding.  Compassion and understanding will help the grieving and overcome the taboo that exists in some quarters still.  Miscarriage is often not spoken about and people are unsure how to react or what to say.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This awkwardness can add to feelings of anxiety for those affected.  Workers here are entitled to the full State maternity benefit if they have a miscarriage from 24 weeks on but not earlier.  However, most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Giving leave, specifically for a pregnancy loss, is about much more than money or time.  Such leave would recognise that pregnancy loss is sometimes part of life.  Tragically it is a very common experience for many women and others in our society.<\/p><p>The reality is that one in five women will experience a miscarriage at some point in their lives - some colleagues have said one in four.  This is a significant number and behind the statistics there is a human story with all the emotions that we easily recognise when a natural death occurs with an adult.<\/p><p>The difficulty women face following a miscarriage can often be added to by having to work, meet colleagues and carry on as if nothing has happened.  If we know anything about life these days, we know that loss arising from death and miscarriage is best handled over time with the help from loved ones, family and friends.  Legislation and making employers aware of the impact of miscarriage will lift the issue out of its secrecy.  When a similar law was being passed in New Zealand this year, it was said that its introduction was &ldquo;for a compassionate and fair leave system that recognises the pain and the grief that comes from miscarriage.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The Bill we are debating recognises another complex and difficult issue - that of infertility.  It is important that people who are experiencing fertility difficulties are helped.  It is a worldwide problem and it is growing according to the World Health Organization.  One in six couples experience it.  It affects men and women, with male infertility now a significant factor.  Similar to the issue of miscarriage, fertility problems are often emotionally difficult to deal with.<\/p><p>Passing this Bill to give leave for women affected by miscarriage will make us leaders in Europe in protecting these workers.  However, in other areas of workers&rsquo; rights and entitlements this State is lagging behind.  For example, this State is one of only five in the EU with no statutory entitlement to sick pay.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has described sick pay a &ldquo;basic right other European workers have.&rdquo;  The State is also an outlier in the fundamental right to collective bargaining, giving workers a greater voice and representation in the workplace.<\/p><p>Providing workers experiencing miscarriage with legal entitlement goes some way to help them at a very difficult time in their lives.  It will also make the issue easier to speak about in the workplace and encourage solidarity and understanding among work colleagues, which is a good outcome for all involved.<\/p><p>I support the legislation.  I thank Senator Bacik and her Labour colleagues for bringing it before the House tonight.  This has been a good debate and one we will continue to have.  Despite some minor disagreements, we can agree that it is of fundamental and universal importance.  I made the point that this issue is often shrouded in secrecy for whatever reason.  I do not say that in any negative or judgmental way; it is entirely understandable in the circumstances.  This legislation should be passed tonight.  One thing that can unify us is a determination to ensure that those workers impacted by this and their families get all the necessary support and consideration along with the services that they need.  This legislation is certainly a step in the right direction in that regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#BBBBB00500","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I commend Senator Bacik and the Labour Party on introducing this legislation.  I am sure everybody in the House is tired of hearing me talk about the importance of the Irish Women Workers' Union winning the two weeks' holiday for everybody.  The Irish Women Workers' Union was founded by many of the women who came out of that revolutionary early part of the State, the founding of the State.  Margaret Skinnider, who came out of that same movement, played a key role in the establishment of the INTO.  I want to acknowledge that organisation's role in pressing forward and putting these issues on the agenda.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik has followed in that same tradition of bringing together gender equality issues and worker equality issues.  In the previous Oireachtas as well as in this one she has introduced important legislation relating to platform workers, collective bargaining - we still need a right to collective bargaining in this country - and joint labour committees, recognising particularly sectors where women are often working which needed collective bargaining rights.  Of course, she has led much of the work on the gender pay gap which, I am glad to see, is now being taken on more widely.<\/p><p>Those are all pieces that fit together, recognising that workers are also people who have lives, who have bodies and who have needs.  That message came strongly from the Citizens' Assembly when it recommended reconfiguring the Constitution so that it recognised the private and family lives of all families - not just married families, but also women who are parenting alone and every kind of family that might be constructed in Ireland.  The Citizens' Assembly also recognised that people may be working and caring, and the need to balance those concerns.  That shows a vision of an integrated honest discussion that we need to have about life.  <\/p><p>I agree that there has been a culture of silence, secrecy, stigma and shame on the issue.  That has not happened without reason.  We must be clear that the eighth amendment to the Constitution played a key role in that.  In countries such as El Salvador and in certain states of the United States a woman can go to prison for having a miscarriage.  That continues to be the reality.  It was a concern when people were afraid to talk about these issues.  I was really struck by Senator Pauline O'Reilly saying that many people will not speak to their doctor.  For a long time, people were afraid to talk about these issues to their doctor, which has major consequences for miscarriage.<\/p><p>For example, for women who are rhesus negative and have an early miscarriage, the fact of having been pregnant for however brief period can have a major impact on the viability of their next pregnancy unless they are able to discuss it and learn about getting the treatment or additional care they might need.  That is why these issues are so important.  The Bill helps not only the individuals who are affected but also shifts the culture in society so that we recognise miscarriage as a very real and very hard thing.<\/p><p>Regarding the question of natural miscarriage versus induced miscarriage, let us be clear there are many kinds of miscarriages.  Miscarriages can be both natural and then induced.  Miscarriage is not always a moment.  I know it generally is in movies, which is the only place we tend to see it.  It is a terrible and awful moment, but many people discover that they have already miscarried when they go in for the nine-week or 12-week scan.  They are probably excited and, unfortunately, they are probably alone because of the rules we have about accessing maternity hospitals at the moment.  They discover that their pregnancy has ended but that their body has not realised it yet.  That may last for a week.  A woman may walk around for a week or ten days looking pregnant but not being pregnant.  That is sometimes how long a miscarriage will take.  That may require medical inducement and surgical intervention.  That is all part of some people's miscarriage journey.  That gives us a sense of why we are not just talking about time to grieve.  Sometimes those 20 days will be needed for the process itself.  <\/p><p>This Bill is important in moving things forward.  Other Senators have mentioned IVF.  The assisted human reproduction legislation must be introduced.  The Minister of State will have heard the demand to have equity at the heart of that legislation.  We should not just deal with the technical and moral issues of assisted human reproduction, but with those issues of equality of access.  Again, this is an important piece that recognises that the times and dates are non-negotiable.  These are very specific days that people have.  <\/p><p>I commend a very important part of the Bill, the protection of employment rights.  It is vital that people who are pregnant, who have a miscarriage or who need to attend IVF appointments do not feel they will be jeopardised, sidelined, mistreated, overlooked for promotion or placed into other roles.  We should not have a culture where people are afraid to speak in their workplace about wanting to have a child.  There is a reason for having protections relating to pregnancy.  Similarly, we should have protections relating to employers not disadvantaging people.  That is why this is not just health legislation; it is workers' rights legislation.  I strongly commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#CCCCC00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party Senators for bringing the Bill forward.  I acknowledge anyone in this House or in the other House who has been affected by this issue.  All Senators know the anguish many people and families suffer in trying to have a child, as well as the physical or psychological pain of miscarriage, IVF and other fertility and reproductive treatments.  It is so common.  Every time I hear the number of people who are affected, I am shocked at how common it is.<\/p> <p>Every circumstance and experience of fertility is different, but there should be clear statutory provisions for when it does not go to plan.  There should be a State safety net to support women through the challenges they often face stoically and silently in the workplace.  All too often, reproductive health in general is hidden.  A matter can be personal and private but not hidden.  It still needs to be provided for with dignity and compassion.  Providing leave in these circumstances acknowledges the loss, anguish and trauma of women and their families, but it is also about workers' rights.  Let us face it, it is mainly about the rights of women workers and making workplaces more realistic and fair for them.  Too many barriers still exist for women in employment and those barriers mainly centre around reproduction, having children and caring for them.  Workplaces are still very much one-size-fits-all places.  The reality is that life is not black and white; there is lots of grey.  That tends to affect women more so throughout their life stages, as was noted.  We need this kind of legislation to break down those barriers.<\/p> <p>The current provision is for a standard 26 weeks of maternity leave and an additional 16 weeks' leave for those who suffer miscarriage after 24 weeks or when the baby reaches a certain weight.  However, there is a need to address the gap in the context of miscarriages before 24 weeks.  All present have been inspired by New Zealand passing the Holidays (Bereavement Leave for Miscarriage) Amendment Act 2021 in March.  It provides an entitlement of three days' leave to mothers and their partners following a miscarriage or stillbirth, which is an extension of the existing statutory bereavement leave in New Zealand.  The Act provides three days' leave for women and their partners who lose a baby at any stage of pregnancy.  Prospective parents will also be eligible if the mother of the baby they were hoping to adopt suffers a miscarriage, which is an important provision.<\/p> <p>Time off for miscarriage at any stage should not be covered by a person's annual leave, sick leave or unpaid leave or by the kindness of the employer. As Senator Sherlock stated, it underlines the inequity of the situation that you may have an employer, job or role that can accommodate such leave, but not all people have that.  There should also be provision for leave in the context of IVF fertility treatment and reproductive health.  That treatment can be incredibly invasive.  Again, it is about inequity or equity in terms of access and costs.  I agree we need a model of care under which infertility issues can be addressed through the public health system.  I, too, wish to see the assisted human reproduction legislation advanced.  It is true that the introduction of any kind of paid leave will necessitate consultation with employers and a full regulatory impact assessment and stakeholder consultation would need to be undertaken.  That is fully understood.<\/p> <p>I thank the Irish Neonatal Health Alliance, INHA, for its Oireachtas briefing document on baby loss.  The briefing notes there is currently no statutory entitlement to paid leave for parents whose child dies at any other age.  That point was touched on by Senator Mullen.  It is something we need to debate and consider.  It is mind-boggling that a parent could be in a position where he or she would have to return to work, particularly before he or she is ready to do so, and that is what would have to be considered.  To return to the point on equity, if people in certain jobs or roles do not have access to that leave, a statutory provision would be a good instrument, but it should be borne in mind that people react differently and some may need more time than others.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the work of Kildare County Council.  The Irish Neonatal Health Alliance noted in its briefing that the council has waived fees for burial plots where a baby is less than 18 months old.  If a family plot is chosen, the plot fee will be reduced.  If the family chooses to bury the baby in an angels plot, the council will waive the fee.   Those are practical things that could be done more widely for families to make something that is so awful a little bit better.  In some countries, the state pays funeral costs for babies and children up to the age of 18.  That is a compassionate support which this debate gives me an opportunity to highlight.<\/p> <p>I will give the last word to the women who went through so much pain by themselves because of restrictions on maternity services.  I acknowledge our female friends in the North who still do not have access to healthcare services in the most tragic of circumstances and have had to travel during Covid-19.  I thank the Senators for raising this issue and I look forward to working with the House on legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#DDDDD00100","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik for bringing the Bill before the House.  Last year, Meghan Markle documented in an article published in <i>The New York Times<\/i>her personal experience of miscarriage.  Her words have instigated an open and public discussion on the topic which truly underscores the need for the Bill.  She wrote, &quot;Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few.&quot;  I agree with her comments.  Women who have experienced miscarriages have often suffered in silence, without public or private support.  It is only right for the Oireachtas to recognise that losing a child before birth is heartbreaking for parents, as Meghan Markle pointed out, and requires time for healing.  It is only right for the Oireachtas to recognise the inadequacies of Ireland's current stance on reproductive health leave.  It is only right for us to support the Bill.<\/p><p>In the briefing paper prepared for Senators on the Bill, we are informed that one in five pregnancies in Ireland each year ends in miscarriage.  One in five parents experience that unbearable grief.  One in five pregnancies annually leave parents heartbroken and possibly in need of support.  Up to 14,000 women a year suffer the death of a baby before 24 weeks' gestation and yet, as pointed out by Niamh Connolly-Coyne, a member of the board of directors of the Irish Neonatal Health Alliance, there is no statutory entitlement to paid leave for parents who experience the tragedy of miscarriage.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes up to 20 days' leave for women and their partners who suffer early miscarriage.  If a woman has a stillborn birth that weighs more than 500 g and has died after 24 weeks' gestation, she is entitled to full maternity leave for 26 weeks as outlined in the Maternity Protection Act 1994 and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004.  Paternity leave is also a statutory entitlement in those circumstances.  The fact the Government offers no statutory protection for a woman who loses her baby a mere week earlier is unacceptable, as the Irish Neonatal Health Alliance has explained.  It urges the Government to address this matter urgently, as do I.  We must ask what difference there is between 23 weeks' gestation and 24 weeks' gestation for a woman who is grieving the loss of her baby.  It does not matter to a woman whether she has miscarried her child or the child was stillborn.  As Mario Rosenstock remarked in an interview with <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last week, &quot;It is the expectation and the burgeoning life that is coming, and it&rsquo;s your preparation for the expectation of life coming into the world, and then for that to be cancelled is so sad and shocking.&quot;  What is the Government doing to offer support to these parents?<\/p><p>Irish women should have the entitlements the Bill would offer them.  I hope this debate and the ultimate passage of the Bill will ensure the conversation about miscarriage will take place and that women and their families will be able to make that healing journey a bit more easily.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Let us not be naive as we consider the full effects of this legislation.  First, it has brought to light a number of issues in Irish law and healthcare concerning reproduction and fertility.  Under the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994, there is no provision to register babies who die before 24 weeks gestation.  The Irish-registered Neonatal Death Alliance has suggested that today's Bill contains measures that will allow an opt-in recognition of these babies.  Will the Bill include these measures?<\/p><p>Furthermore, there is no provision in Irish law to help cover the costs of a child's death.  The Irish Neonatal Health Alliance has commended Kildare County Council, as Senator Currie mentioned earlier.  Will this Bill include the provision for a children's funeral fund as implemented in the UK and Wales?  Many undertakers in this country do not charge for funerals of stillborn babies and I commend those who provide that service.<\/p><p>What about the implications of the Bill as written regardless of the amendments that may be made?  Will it make employers in the private sector more reluctant to hire women given the potential cost of providing leave for them?  The Bill proposes an entitlement of up to ten days of leave for anyone who seeks reproductive healthcare treatments such as IVF.  The Bill is not clear about all of the treatments and types of losses where people are entitled to leave.  Will women who are expecting but experience a loss after an abortion be included in the Bill?  Without clarity on such issues can we have clarity on how the Bill will have an impact on women in the labour force?<\/p><p>The legislation we are debating today is proposed in response to concerns by members of Ireland's labour forces.  Representatives of the INTO approached Senator Bacik for assistance with the matter and, undoubtedly, the Oireachtas must respond.  There is a certain humanity and respect owed to this situation that Meghan Markle and Mario Rosenstock, and many women and fathers who have lost their child, have described equally as heartbreaking in this manner and the current Irish law is missing that.  However, in their response the legislators must carefully consider the scope of the reproductive health leave Bill.  The legislators must discuss and consider what amendments will be made to this Bill and the likely impact that it will have on females in the labour force and women business owners.  I have been a business owner throughout my career and employers have responsibilities towards their employees.  I know that one's employees are the last thing one should think about when one is having a child but one does worry who will pay the wages to staff.  As a woman in business, I found it hard to comprehend why there was never anything in legislation that affords women and others in business maternity leave, paternity leave or, indeed, leave to cover a miscarriage.  We should address this matter but I do not know how that will be done.  We must help women in business and women entrepreneurs who feel responsible for their employees.             <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#DDDDD00200","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time equally with Senator Seery Kearney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEEEE00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It affects men, women and their partners.  This is an important topic and I am sure that he is taking our contributions to heart.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Sherlock for her contribution and openness, which will support so many.  She is very brave.  I thank Senator Bacik for the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I thank all the Senators for their excellent contributions.  Yes, Senator Higgins is absolutely right that there is a culture of silence and we know that is because women's health sometimes has not been to the forefront as it should be.  I say to all the young women who are listening to us right now that we want a more open and fair Ireland, and be in no doubt we will achieve that with each piece of legislation that we pass here.  We want changes to support women and we want equality so that is access to health, leave and equality in the workplace.  We are not there yet but we will get there.  We want equality. <\/p> <p>I acknowledge the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  I thank Ms Siobh&aacute;n Lynskey from the INTO branch in Tuam, County Galway, for tabling a motion on this matter.  I thank all of the men and women who have contacted and emailed all of us here on this topic and expressed support for women to have reproductive leave.<\/p> <p>A miscarriage or the IVF process can be traumatic experiences for women and their partners, and there is a period of mourning and loss.  There are also challenges with infertility and IVF success rates, which makes this all so tough.  The Government did make a commitment in the programme for Government to provide a model of care for infertility.  The Government is committing funding but with all the impacts of Covid and the lockdown there are delays.  We have four regional fertility hubs and another two are being rolled out.  I ask that we see movement on that initiative as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>The INTO, in its press release, noted that one third of its members are under the age of 35 and over 85% are female so it is no wonder that the INTO brought this matter forward.  The INTO is the first group to do this and it is an issue that has an impact on so many and people in all walks of life.<\/p> <p>As someone who was a substitute teacher at second level, I understand how teachers are very limited in their time off and try to schedule everything around their limited time.  Such a situation is not right and is not good enough.<\/p> <p>As a woman, as a member of Fine Gael and as a Member with my Government colleagues here, we very much support leave and support women in the call for reproductive health leave, and in terms of leave following a miscarriage.  I support the well-being of women and commend the  New Zealand Parliament on leading the way with its introduction of three days paid leave.<\/p> <p>In terms of taboo subjects, I spoke about menopause last week and stressed that it is important that we support public awareness measures, particularly the Sl&aacute;intecare aim to have healthy communities.  It is important that we improve access to healthcare measures and supports.  We must get away from the taboo of silence and stigma, which means people must open up and talk to their GPs.  It is shocking to think that women cannot speak to their GPs about these matters.  Silence in workplaces is frustrating.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will review this matter and engage with stakeholders to commission research.  I very much support our colleagues in doing that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#EEEEE00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party Senators.  I welcome the opportunity to endorse the introduction of statutory leave to support the experience of miscarriage and reproductive health.  I believe that this leave will be provided for during the tenure of this Government as it is the next logical provision to build on what has been an evolving framework for family supports, under my own party in government for the last ten years.<\/p> <p>In the devastation of pregnancy loss, especially early pregnancy, couples need time off together.  Both the mother who experiences physical and emotional loss and her partner who experiences emotional loss need to be able to support each other as they mourn.<\/p> <p>A couple entering into IVF treatment should also be able to spend time in the physical and emotional head and heart space away from the concerns of normal life.  I have been there 13 times - 12 personally and one via surrogacy.  It is an exciting, frightening and emotional rollercoaster and, in that place, I have experienced five miscarriages and the joy of the birth of our daughter via surrogacy.<\/p> <p>I am grateful for the great strides that the Government is making in moving forward with the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill and its surrogacy provision.  I am pleased that that Bill when published will reflect what is possible and will legislate ethically for surrogacy in a manner that reflects the lived experience of couples in this country with a retrospective provision for those children whose mothers, like me, are not currently recognised in the State as such.  I welcome that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, the Minister for Health, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have set up an interdepartmental group that will collaborate with people from the assisted human reproduction collaborative group.<\/p> <p>I completely support the right to leave for fertility treatment.  The discussions here this evening have been very good and, quite rightly, move away from the idea of shame and stigma.  However, I caution against any presumptions being made about how couples should deal with their IVF journey.  Through my own experience, and that of couples with whom I have worked, I know that couples differ in how they wish to speak about their fertility journey.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some choose to be public and others choose to be private, generally born out of their own fears or confidence in their coping mechanisms.  They are fearful of their IVF journey not resulting in success.  Opening up their journey brings with it the possibility of commentary from others or the dismissal of their journey by others, as well as the hopes and expectations of others, such as grandparents waiting for a child.  In my own experience, in people trying to mind me, I was excluded from children's birthday parties and thus I never had the opportunity to attend and have a glass of wine.  In thinking they were minding me, people excluded me, which made the pain of the journey all the worse.  We need to be careful not to force a position where everything has to be out in the open.  In creating a provision and entitlement, we need to be mindful and sensitive to that.  How a couple decides to deal with it needs to be respected.<\/p><p>I welcome this provision and I welcome the research to be undertaken by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, which I think is necessary.

I acknowledge Senator Seery Kearney's contribution and the pain she has endured.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State, Deputy English, to be a compassionate man.  I have no doubt he will take this debate in that vein.  I commend my male colleagues for being here.  Too often when we have debates on what are perceived as women's health issues, there is a lack of the male voice.  It is refreshing to see so many of my male colleagues here today.  It is really important because the journey of fertility and the journey of loss is as much a matter for the man as it is for their partner.  I, again, thank my male colleagues for being here.<\/p> <p>I thank my colleagues, Senators Bacik and Sherlock, for bringing this motion before us.  It is very timely.  I was reminded on my Facebook memories feed that three years ago we had the opportunity to discuss women's health and women's right to choose.  Yesterday evening at 8 p.m. the RT&Eacute; Radio 1 \"Drama on One\"  was a play entitled \"No One Ever Asked Me That\", which was incredible.  It was the story of two friends, Jenny and Clare, who were on opposite sides of the same journey.  One of them had discovered she was pregnant when she really did not want to be for various reasons and the other, a best friend, was desperately trying to get pregnant.  The loss and tragedy for both of them and their partners was well illustrated.  At the time, I was driving from my mother's home to my own home and I remained in the car for 25 minutes to listen to the end of the story.  It was compelling.  Fair play to RT&Eacute; for dealing with both sides of the issue so sensitively.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that the programme for Government provides for a welcome shift in regard to women's health.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Ministers of State in the Department of Health have done a huge amount of work in this area in the last ten months.  The Minister has established a women's health fund, introduced two community-based ambulatory gynaecology services, expanded the endometriosis service and, the day before yesterday, announced a clinical lead for women's health in general practice to enable the development of a comprehensive life course approach to women's health, which is a first for Ireland.  The Free Provision of Period Products Bill 2021 has been adopted by the Government as well.  We are on a positive trajectory in terms of the work being done in regard to surrogacy, IVF and assisted human reproductive services, all of which are important.  <\/p> <p>The loss of a child is incredibly traumatic.  It brings many emotions.  I thank, in particular, those who have shared their stories with me, and not just over the last few days.  I refer to a friend, Jackie Tyrell, who spoke publicly about her loss, and her partner Carl's loss, of twin boys eight years ago.  I learned so much from her, including about F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in and the incredible work it does to support those who have had miscarriages and stillbirths.  Once a person reaches out, there is incredible support and love available to them from volunteers across the country.  I know of so many women, including my mother, who knitted shawls and cardigans for their baby and, where appropriate, hired a photographer to take photographs so that they could have a lifelong memory of the child.<\/p> <p>As I said, I welcome and support the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of the INTO.  I was a member of the INTO for many years.  Many principals that I know, when faced with this situation, were very understanding and compassionate and granted the leave, but it is important there is a legislative framework for would-be mums and would-be dads when they are going through a very difficult time.  The Government has already committed to further research, which I welcome.  It will be undertaken by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  A separate piece of stand-alone legislation on existing family leave would be appropriate for miscarriage and reproductive health leave.  That is important, in particular to all of those who are listening in and are touched by this topic, which may be far more people than any of us will ever know.  I have heard some stories and I know of some struggles, but there are many whose struggles I do not know about.  It is important they know that we are having this debate about trying to make their journey a little easier in the future.  That is as much as we can do.  Sadly, as we know, annually 16,000 babies are not born.  We need to hold their parents in our hearts and do what we can to help them on their journey of loss and grief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#FFFFF00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill from the Labour Party group leader, Senator Bacik, who, I believe, has now introduced and had passed more Private Members' Bills than any other Senator, which is a record to be proud of.<\/p> <p>This Bill is fundamentally practical, useful and timely.  As we begin to emerge from the strangest of times for the organisation of working time for the entire country under Covid-19 restrictions,  it is prime time to discuss how we structure our working lives, which must interact in a flexible and, ultimately, understanding way with our lives.  For women, that is a particularly unique intersection because our bodies experience a very wide range of reproductive experiences from periods to pregnancy, endometriosis, miscarriage, abortion, perimenopause and full-blown menopause.  Over the course of our lives, we will take long-term medication to manage both our reproductive cycle and the hormonal and pain management that comes with that.  It is a real hoot.  An issue not always acknowledged enough in our discussions about women in work is the physical pain of an internal organ shed its internal wall once a month.  It is pretty sore and quite inconvenient.  The physical pain and fatigue associated with every one of the events I have mentioned are normal and are expected to be borne by women while working, all the while smiling, mothering, managing and scheduling and doing up to 70% of the domestic work in the family home.  In short, it is not easy being a working woman, or a working trans woman.  To be frank, for those with a uterus working is not easy.<\/p> <p>This legislation, posed by Senator Bacik, is about ensuring dignity, care and compassion are exercised in respect of those who many find themselves in need of time off from work to manage the physical, psychological and emotional impact of miscarriage or IVF.  At this moment, I am thinking of some of my young friends who for various reasons have had to have a hysterectomy, some of them in their early 20s.  They, too, have faced a number of reproductive complications and have had to leave this country in order to get the life-saving or life-changing surgery they needed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While the Bill is specifically about reproductive leave, I want to flag that we should not forget that reproductive complication goes a bit further than we have been talking most commonly about today.  Let us remind ourselves that the issue under discussion is far more common than we think, based on how little we talk or are encouraged to talk about this.  The statistics have been outlined.  For example, one in four pregnancies will end in miscarriage and one in five couples will experience fertility issues.  I am aware we are rattling off the statistics but many people, some in this room, have lived experience of these issues.  I hope the proposed legislation gives some of them comfort and optimism that we are going to go in the right direction in this country in dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>The vast majority of people will be in work while they experience these issues, so it almost comical that, in 2021, we do not have standard leave applicable for 50% of working people when they need it in respect of pregnancy loss or accessing fertility treatments.  We also do not have standard work practice polices in most places for periods, menopause or endometriosis.  These are a normal part of women&rsquo;s lives that cost us money, time and emotional and physical pain, but are simply not talked about in the place were we may spend more hours a week than we do with our family or in our own homes.  These are all places where this goes unspoken about. <\/p><p>This legislation not only addresses the very practical provision of leave for those who need it, but it opens up spaces, workplaces and radio studios to this conversation that we have all been avoiding for a long time, which is that women's reproductive lives are simply not the same as men&rsquo;s.   Our bodies have this tedious reproductive and fertility system ticking away and we have to manage that and factor it into our everyday lives, mostly with little or no support.  I am acutely aware of Senator Seery Kearney&rsquo;s point that not everyone wants to be able to discuss this and that there may be people listening today, or even in this room, for whom this is a deeply personal conversation.  As I said, I hope that whatever way people find to deal with these things, they will take some comfort from the fact legislation is being brought forward that will make things better for other people coming after them, and that we are going to do the right thing.<\/p><p>The loss of a pregnancy is an incredibly difficult thing to go through.  I have failed to this point to mention that it is not only difficult for those who experience pregnancy loss, but also for their partners.  There are also extraordinary added complications for a trans person who experiences pregnancy loss or fertility issues.  In 2021, it is time to have these difficult conversations and recognise that, very often, the people we walk past in the corridor or share an office cubicle with, although we have not been sharing an office much in the past year, may be silently suffering and our current work practices are compounding their anguish.  Let us get this Bill passed.<\/p><p>As has been said, his Bill is about workers&rsquo; rights and, as a trade unionist, I am proud once again to be part of a party in the Seanad that is consistently putting forward legislation on workers&rsquo; rights.  I thank the many people who have reached out to me with their deeply personal stories.  Everyone in this Chamber has probably had somebody reach out to them in advance of this debate.  I thank those who have shared today, particularly Senator Mary Seery Kearney for her honesty and her frankness.  Again, I commend my colleague, friend and comrade, Senator Ivana Bacik, on once again leading the legislative charge and bringing forward this timely, necessary and important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#FFFFF00400","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I call Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy, who is sharing time with Senator John Cummins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#GGGGG00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I commend the Bill and I commend Senators Bacik and Sherlock on bringing it forward.

If the Bill is enacted, it will give an entitlement for up to 20 days of paid leave for women experiencing the trauma of early miscarriage and up to ten days of paid leave for employees accessing other reproductive health treatments, such as IVF.  I fully support this important legislation and I hope it will progress through both Houses.  The Bill will give practical support to workers and help to open up a national conversation around reproductive health and fertility in this country.  Conversations such as these help to destigmatise the isolating and traumatic reproductive health challenges lived by so many people in this country every day.<\/p> <p>Many people return to work immediately and this is not right.  Any parent knows the road to parenthood is sometimes not easy.  However, for some couples it is devastating.  Approximately 14,000 women in Ireland suffer a miscarriage every year; therefore, more than one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage.  Between one in four and one in six couples or individuals in Ireland encounters difficulty conceiving.  The success rate for patients at a given IVF clinic in Ireland is approximately 25% for patients aged over 40, and the majority of clinics in Ireland list IVF at a cost of between &euro;4,500 and &euro;5,000 per cycle.<\/p> <p>While a number of maternity hospitals have set up bereavement specialist teams to support parents, it is not enough.  Currently, too many people, women in particular, suffer in silence because they do not believe the support is there for them.  These personal struggles have been carried out in silence, with many workers taking annual leave to access reproductive health care or after the tragedy of an early miscarriage.  This Bill is important to show that there will be support at what is a very difficult time for parents, women in particular.  I fully support the Bill and I look forward to seeing it pass through both Houses and being enacted in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#GGGGG00300","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague for sharing time.  I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on what is a very important topic.  In doing so, it is important to pause and reflect on the significant advances that have been implemented in recent years to support families that have been fortunate enough to have children.  On top of the 26 weeks paid maternity leave, we now have two weeks paid paternity leave, introduced in 2016, which can be taken at any time in the first six months after the birth, or placement in the case of adoption.  We now have five weeks paid parents leave, which was introduced for both parents, and this can be taken in the first two years of the child's life.  We now have unpaid parental leave, which has been extended from 22 to 26 weeks since 1 September last year, and it can be taken before the child's 12th birthday, or 16th birthday in the case of a disability.  A national childcare scheme was also introduced to provide financial support to help parents meet the cost of childcare.  This includes a universal subsidy for children aged under three and a means-assessed subsidy for children aged up to 15.<\/p> <p>We are here to talk about those who have not been fortunate enough to avail of these provisions due to fertility issues or due to miscarriage or stillbirth.  As Senator Ahearn said, debate on this cohort of people has increased considerably in recent weeks since the New Zealand Parliament passed the Holidays (Bereavement Leave for Miscarriage) Amendment Act 2021, providing an entitlement to mothers and their partners of three days paid leave following a miscarriage or stillbirth at any stage of pregnancy.  Prospective parents will also be eligible if the mother of the baby they were hoping to adopt from suffers a miscarriage.  This new law, mandating three days of paid bereavement leave, is distinct from sick leave or maternity leave, and is something which I believe, as a Government, we need to take action on in short order.<\/p> <p>As many speakers said, this issue often goes unspoken about within families, groups of friends and wider society.  That has to change.  It is often the case that couples suffer in silence and do not talk about the difficulties they experience in conceiving or throughout pregnancy.  In cases where couples suffer miscarriage or stillbirths and subsequently have successful pregnancies, their sons and daughters often never find out about the siblings they could have had until many years later, if at all.  As legislators, I believe we have a role in heightening awareness of reproductive health and the onus is on us to ensure we put necessary supports in place to support families at what is an exceptionally difficult time.

The human story is always important.  I hope the stories of the two Senators and their contributions tonight will give hope and solace to those going through this most difficult stage in their lives and let them know they are not alone.  As Senator Seery Kearney said, it is important to know there is somebody to talk to, but only if they want somebody to talk to.  I thank my colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, for her work on this Bill.<\/p><p>Sadly, one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, affecting 14,000 women.  Behind the figures are human stories, including stories of hope and, indeed, stress.  Most important, they are stories of Irish women and men whose lives will revolve around starting a family.<\/p><p>For far too long, women have had to remain silent in their workplaces about the grief of early miscarriage or have had to use their annual leave to attend appointments for IVF treatment.  This Bill seeks to provide women and, indeed, men with support in the workplace when they are struggling with fertility or other reproductive health issues.  The Bill is about recognising that behind the miscarriage statistics are hopes and dreams dashed through pregnancy loss.  Most important, it is about real change whereby this country will finally begin to recognise the importance of women in the workplace.  The Bill will assist so many of them when they need assistance most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#GGGGG00600","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Bacik and Sherlock for this Bill.  I thank the Labour Party in general for its work in this area.  I am glad to have a chance to be part of this discussion but I am probably more glad to be able to listen to the discussion, for once.  Without a doubt, we are all supportive of the need to introduce change in this area as quickly as possible.  I had a great chance just to sit back and listen to everybody's personal stories and the stories relayed to them.  Everybody knows somebody who has been touched by miscarriage or a stillbirth after the long journey to try to have a family in the first place and all the complications that go with that.  Some people have been very lucky on that journey while some have been very unlucky.  Everyone's story is different, and everyone is affected differently.  It is important when bringing forward legislation and having these discussions that we try to capture all that as best we can.  I am glad we have had a really good conversation here tonight.  It will not complete the legislative journey but it will certainly have been a major contributor.  I thank both of the Senators for introducing the Bill and giving us an opportunity to discuss it.<\/p> <p>A couple of issues arise.  We can all understand that the loss is absolutely devastating for anybody who has been in any of the scenarios described.  I am aware of the time invested by those who want to have a baby.  They go to great lengths but, for whatever reason, it might not happen for them.  We have to try to find ways to make the journey easier for everybody, including in respect of dealing with the sorrow and joy and trying to find the time.  Over the years, we have made improvements to give people more time when they are successful in starting a family but there is so much more we need to do.  I am conscious that this discussion has been going on for many years.  It certainly came to the fore again with the legislation that was passed in New Zealand.  It was a welcome boost and an example to many other countries.  We are here to discuss a Bill that goes further than that, and rightly so.  I am glad we are doing that.<\/p> <p>Many referred to secrecy and the inability of families who are going through what I have described to have the conversation.  There may be familial or social reasons for this but they certainly should not be based on one's job or employment.  Through legislation, we are trying to make a change to ensure people will not be afraid to have a conversation with an employer, boss, manager, supervisor or colleague or will not shy away from it because of fear over what will happen afterwards.  People wonder whether they will miss out on a promotion or not get the job in the first place.  Other such scenarios arise.  These should not be part of one's thinking.  Sadly, we are aware that they are.  It is only through legislation, good practice, consultation, advice, guidance for employers and the associated directions that we will change this.  We have made great strides but we have a long way to go.<\/p> <p>I can see from the correspondence I received in the past couple of days that people are still afraid to have this conversation at work or to ask for time off.  People will admit, however, that the majority of employers are in a good space and try and want to do the right thing.  Some might not be able to have the conversation themselves or find it very awkward but they certainly want advice and guidance.  They come to us and employment agencies to get that advice and guidance.  Very often, legislation is what is needed to pave the way and really set a mark.  I am glad that all of us, across all parties, are committed to legislation.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, got permission from the Cabinet to move forward with legislation in this area.  We are certainly not opposing the Bill tonight.  Senator Bacik will understand that we cannot agree with everything.  We agree on the principle and what we want to achieve overall.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will commission research on this and there will be consultation on it to move on with this journey.<\/p> <p>Let me address some of the issues regarding which we have concerns.  In this regard, Senator Bacik mentioned the structure of the legislation.  In her opening speech, she was clear and honest about the fact that this is an attempt to move things forward.  She is not claiming that everything is perfect.  We are not claiming to know everything either but we want to tease this through and engage in the process as quickly as possible to try to get where we want to go.  We can certainly support the principle of the legislation but we need to try to deal with the format and structure.<\/p> <p>The Government feels that stand-alone legislation is merited.  Dedicated legislation is warranted to address the matter of reproductive health and to meet the need for time off, paid leave, additional unpaid leave or whatever else is required by people who have had a miscarriage or stillborn child.  We would like to work with the House on that and ascertain how we can make progress.  Most legislation in this area is stand-alone legislation.<\/p> <p>We do not believe the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is the appropriate legislative mechanism to deal with the policies regarding miscarriage or reproductive healthcare.  Existing compassionate leave arrangements are legislated for in specific Acts.  The Carer's Leave Act and the family provisions such as the Parental Leave Acts of 1998 and 2019 all had an individual journey because they required their own research, evidence, consultation and guidance to get them absolutely right.  <\/p> <p>The Organisation of Working Time Act was to provide for the implementation of the European working time directive.  It sets out an employee's maximum working hours and entitlements to minimum rest periods and a minimum period of paid annual leave but it was not designed to be the instigator of new policies or to set out the terms and conditions regarding specific forms of compassionate leave.  While it can be adjusted to recognise other policy changes, we do not believe it is the legislation to use.  That is not a criticism; we just believe it is better to have stand-alone legislation.  I will be happy to work with the Senators on that.  As this Bill progresses, it will probably give us an opportunity to develop our thinking in this regard and to work it out together.  That is what the T&aacute;naiste wants to do because our Department recognises it is important from an employment point of view, but it might not need to be led through employment legislation.  More than likely, it will be an equality matter.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, wants to lead off on that and has got permission to do so.<\/p> <p>To be absolutely clear, it is only a question of the structure; it is not about the principle.  The Government is on the same page as everybody else here.  It is a matter of how we can proceed appropriately and make sure we address all the various scenarios and deal with everyone's concerns and hurt.<\/p> <p>I want to be fair.  We have had this discussion before when dealing with other legislation in the Seanad.  Senator Sherlock introduced the statutory sick pay Bill.  We had the same conversation in that regard and asked for a little more time.  I am aware that we are asking for a lot of trust from the Opposition when we say we are with it on a journey and a principle but that we need a little time.  This is what we are doing with this Bill.  When dealing with the statutory sick pay Bill, I stood here and asked for six or seven months.  I am conscious that the six months was probably up at the end of April or during May but the legislation is nearly ready to introduce to the House.  We honoured our commitment and we will bring the legislation before the House.  The same commitment is being made regarding the Bill before us.<\/p> <p>We must recognise that many employers do the right thing, try to get it right, have the conversation with their colleagues and determine what is suitable.  I received an email from a friend this week who explained to me that he or she sat down with an employee and agreed that, for a miscarriage, a week of paid leave was appropriate, and that if more time were needed, it would be unpaid.  They were able to have the conversation, tease out the matter together and review the decision afterwards to see whether the right approach was taken.  Everybody in the working environment benefits because the organisation now has proposals for dealing with these circumstances.  We like to see employers and employees having these conversations and developing a culture that respects both the employer and employee and the importance of both.  It is a question of legislation to lead off on this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reason I reference businesses and the different approaches by employers is that the majority want to do it.  Many of us know from talking to small business owners with a low number of employees that they find it difficult when it comes to the financial aspect of paid leave.  They are supportive and would like to do the right thing but some businesses cannot afford to do that.  That is why when we bring forward legislation which states it is to be paid by the employer, we have to have strike a balance with the State supporting employers who cannot do that.  If we agree we want to make reproductive health leave available in a caring way, we have to have a straightforward, honest conversation with those businesses.  We accept many can afford to do it and should step up; others need assistance.  As we are having these conversations similarly regarding the statutory sick pay scheme, a scheme is to be put in place and likewise we will see changes here.  However, we need to have that conversation with employers and find the genuine ones who cannot and we need to step up and support them through State supports, which we would do with the minimum wage as well.  Thankfully, the majority of companies are able to handle that and bring it forward.<br\/><br\/>We need a full regulatory impact of legislation such as this.  There is no point in imposing this on anybody.  We need to bring everybody with us on that journey.  We have achieved a lot in this House over recent years when it comes to strengthening legislation relating to employees and working conditions.  We have done it in conjunction with our social partners and I accept that is the intention Labour has here but I ask that we spend a bit of time doing that.  That consultation and research is what it is about.<br\/><br\/>Others went through some parts of the Bill we have issues and concerns with.  Any time a Bill is brought forward, changes are needed.  We are committed to compassionate leave.  There is currently no statutory leave entitlement for parents for pregnancy for less than 24 weeks.  We want to change that and are committed to changing it.  There is no statutory entitlement for any workers for any bereavement or compassionate leave, including pregnancy loss.  We have to tease that through and have that conversation.  Bereavement leave can be provided for in an employment contract.  Some do that; some do not.  Some do it in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>or unplanned way and look after each other.  We have that in local businesses, but it is not possible in other organisations.  Others do it by way of custom, practice and common decency.  That is common in our businesses and is something I am proud of.  Other cases fall to an employer's discretion. <br\/><br\/>It should not have to be an awkward conversation.  It should not be about the woman going through this or her partner having to ask or bring up the conversation or being afraid of having the conversation and thinking about it.  They should know the legislation and guidance are there to protect them and that is what we want to try to achieve.<br\/><br\/>This is an area the Government wants to work on with all Members.  I get a strong sense we are all on the same space on that.  I thank everybody for their commitment and for sharing their personal stories and stories of the people they represent.  We know there are many people out there who have been hurt a lot and the least we can do is try to ease that pain a little bit.  It does not mean we can deal with all situations that are there because the sorrow for some is something we cannot get in and help.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Loughlin touched on the number of men in the Chamber.  We are glad to be here and to be part of the conversation but we can never feel what women are going through.  We try to understand it and we research it.  I am lucky to be a parent of four young kids at home.  We can understand a lot of it but we can only be part of that conversation.  We have to work with women on that to make sure we get it right and that is why we are glad to be here and contribute.  As a Minister of State with responsibility for employment law along with the T&aacute;naiste, I am happy for our Department to play its part working alongside the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the other Departments that have a role in this.  We will be able to continue this conversation over the weeks and months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#HHHHH00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank all who spoke so eloquently in support of the Bill.  Everyone was supportive and tonight we saw the Seanad at its best.  I thought the speeches were so moving and eloquent.  I particularly thank those who shared their personal experiences.  Senators Sherlock and Seery Kearney spoke courageously about their own life experiences.  We all know people who have been through this.  I am lucky enough to be a mother of teenage daughters.  All of us understand the pain and heartbreak experienced by so many in what somebody described as the road to parenthood.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about miscarriage as something that is experienced by many but talked about by few.  That summed up the culture of silence.  So many of the brave women and men who emailed and contacted us talked about the feeling they could not speak about this, particularly in the workplace to their employer, even to their doctor or anyone beyond a small circle.  That for all of us in the Labour group encapsulates why this Bill is so important.  It seeks to introduce a practical measure and, symbolically, it seeks to break down the culture of silence and give people space to speak about these raw and difficult personal experiences.  I thank again all colleagues for those outstanding contributions.  I thank the Minister of State for his positive response.  I particularly thank the INTO and Councillor Alison Gilliland who initiated this legislation for their work on this area.<\/p><p>The Bill is about choice for women and couples experiencing difficulties with reproductive health.  It does not place any onus on any employee to speak publicly or within their workplace.  Currently many conversations are going on within workplaces.  Many people may not wish to have that conversation, even if the Bill is introduced.  The point is it would provide choice.  It is an equality measure, specifically to enable recognition of women's reproductive health, and a workplace measure for men and women.  It has been positive to see so many male colleagues as well as women contributing to this debate.  It is about improving quality of life and culture in the workplace.<\/p><p>Some asked about the extent of the application of the Bill.  Legislation is in place relating to late miscarriage or later stillbirth.  I pay tribute to the work of F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in and the neonatal and stillbirth alliance, which brought to my attention and that of others the gap where earlier stillbirth is not covered.  This Bill does not cover that but now that it has been brought to our attention, it is clear more needs to be done.<\/p><p>The Bill does not apply to partners.  It applies to somebody who needs medically certified time off for reproductive health treatment.  That would include termination of pregnancy and early miscarriage.  There is a physical and emotional recovery involved.  It is not a cover-all bill.  It does not cover bereavement.  Many people have spoken eloquently about bereavement, losing a child, spouse or partner.  We do not, as the Minister of State said, have statute law on that; we should.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, brought forward legislation on parental leave previously.  That is beyond the scope of this modest proposal. <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, referred to the structure of the Bill.  I agree with him.  We introduced the Bill as a modest proposal in early March based on the <i>force majeure<\/i>leave provision in the Organisation of Working Time Act.  Given the number of people who have come to us and the experiences we have heard about, I agree with him.  It is more appropriate for a stand-alone Bill or a Bill that comes within the equality framework.  I would like to work with him, his Department and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and his Department on developing that framework.  The number of issues, the extent of the experience and the fact that so many people are touched by this points to the need for stand-alone legislation that is not just built onto the existing legislative framework, which is the Organisation of Working Time Act.  It may be that some sort of banded leave provision should be provided for, depending on the stage in pregnancy when a miscarriage is suffered or a stillbirth is experienced.  The INTO first talked to me about that.  It may be that would come as an amendment to the employment equality legislation.<\/p><p>These are technical matters.  What is important to all of us here tonight and all those affected by the issues we are discussing is that the principle be recognised and that there should be statutory recognition for time off work for people who need it where they have experienced miscarriage, the loss of a wanted pregnancy or are enduring IVF or other fertility or reproductive health treatments.  I am happy to continue to work with the Minister of State and other colleagues in this House on this issue. <\/p><p>I again thank all Members for the support.  I am conscious of all the people touched by the issues and thinking of them and the journeys they have been on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#JJJJJ00200","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621848600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#JJJJJ00350","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Next Monday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021052400002#JJJJJ00375","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1621848600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
