This represents Decision Gate 1 under the <i>Public Spending Code<\/i>and those Preliminary Business Cases are currently under review.

provide credit) carrying out credit servicing activities (which includes the holding of legal title to credit, or managing or administering a credit agreement) requires authorisation by the Central Bank of Ireland as a 'credit servicing firm'.  Accordingly, such firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA), Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises 2012 and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).  <\/p>  <p>  For borrowers who are experiencing difficulty with a mortgage which is secured on a primary home, the CCMA requires regulated entities, including credit servicing firms, to have a fair and transparent process for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  The mortgage arrears resolution process that is contained in the CCMA sets out the steps a regulated entity must follow in respect of communication with the borrower, gathering of financial information, assessment of the borrower's situation and consideration of resolution options.  In particular, in relation to a 'co-operating borrower', provision 39 of the CCMA provides that, in order to determine options for alternative arrangements for each particular case, a regulated entity must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that entity.  Provision 45 further provides that if a regulated entity does not offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement, for example, where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable and an alternative repayment arrangement is unlikely to be appropriate, the lender must provide the reasons to the borrower. In these circumstances, the lender must inform the borrower of other options available to the borrower and the implications of each option for the borrower; and his\/her mortgage loan account. These options could include mortgage to rent, voluntary surrender, trading down, or voluntary sale. <\/p>  <p>  Provision 49 of the CCMA also requires that each regulated entity must have an appeals process to enable a borrower to appeal in relation to a decision of the regulated entity including:<\/p>  <p>  - where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a regulated entity and the borrower is not willing to enter into the alternative repayment arrangement;<\/p>  <p>  - where a regulated entity declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement to a borrower;<\/p>  <p>  - where a regulated entity classifies a borrower as 'not co-operating'.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, a consumer has a right to make a complaint to a regulated financial services provider if they are not satisfied with the service they have received. Should they remain not satisfied with the final response from the regulated financial services provider in question they then have a right to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (&lsquo;FSPO&rsquo;).<\/p>  <p>  Final decisions on eligibility for the mortgage to rent scheme, however, will rest with the relevant local authority.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600068#WRB05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600068#WRB05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600068#WRB05100"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[48431\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600068#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when a decision will be made on the allocation of the Brexit adjustment fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>Ireland has been allocated &euro;1.065 billion in constant (2018) prices, equivalent to &euro;1.165 billion in current prices.

In order for a borrower to qualify for the MTR scheme, the mortgage, property and household must meet detailed eligibility criteria.  In addition, the MTR process has to be carefully implemented with so many parties involved, including the homeowner, the lender, the relevant local authority and the Approved Housing Body or Private Company willing to acquire the property to enable the borrower to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.<\/p>  <p>  The MTR scheme relies on the lender making the scheme available to the borrower where the lender has deemed the mortgage to be unsustainable and assesses the borrower as being eligible for the MTR scheme.  If a borrower has not been offered an alternative repayment arrangement, or where a borrower is unwilling to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement, and requests the lender to consider them for the MTR scheme and the lender assesses the borrower as being ineligible for the MTR, the lender is required to notify the borrower in writing of the reason(s) for ineligibility in a timely manner.  Should it transpire that MTR is not an option in a particular case, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank.  The Government introduced the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold retain the same protections which they had prior to the sale.  In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged. <\/p>  <p>  My focus, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes and I would encourage borrowers to engage with the Abhaile Service, the national mortgage arrears resolution service, which is available free of charge to the borrower.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire\/Rathdown County Councils. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I am aware that the most recent fire-fighter recruitment campaign  began in September 2019; all recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process. The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December to take up positions across the brigade in January 2022. A further third recruit class will begin training early in February 2022 with a start date for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruit&rsquo;s currently under review. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a statutory risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. That level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates. As this is Fire Safety Week 2021, I remind everybody of the importance of testing their smoke alarms regularly and I commend the kind of community fire safety initiatives aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society, which are undertaken by fire services and are seen a key driver of the welcome downward trends. <\/p>  <p>  Local Authority fire services in Ireland is staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel  in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service over the past number of years. The number of  frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission.  Unfortunately, the parties were not able to reach agreement on all the issues at this time, some of which are intended to alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements. I encourage all parties involved to re-engage and to continue to use the State's established statutory industrial relations machinery to resolve the issues concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600069#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600069#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[48595\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600069#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he remains committed to terminating the Strategic Housing Development planning process in February 2022, in view of the recently announced planning legislation review; if he plans to implement a new planning arrangement for large-scale residential proposals before this review is completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>My colleague, Minister O'Brien, submitted a Memorandum to Government on 13 July 2021, accompanied by a General Scheme of a Planning and Development (Amendment) (LSRD) Bill 2021 (the General Scheme), outlining proposals for the replacement of the current planning arrangements in respect of Strategic Housing Developments (SHDs) with new streamlined arrangements for large-scale residential developments (LSRDs).

The progress being made will continue to be monitored by the Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Electoral Acts provide for a range of measures to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities, including:<\/p>  <p>  - The requirement on local authorities, in making polling schemes, to appoint as polling places areas where at least one polling station will be accessible to wheelchair users;<\/p>  <p>  - The requirement on Returning Officers, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users and to give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given  to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps;<\/p>  <p>  - The requirement on Returning Officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by wheelchair users. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement;<\/p>  <p>  - The requirement on Returning Officers to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users. <\/p>  <p>  If an elector anticipates difficulty in gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. Furthermore, a person with a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. A person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home if they apply to be included in the special voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. <\/p>  <p>   While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, nonetheless my Department continues to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD01900"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[48734\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a plan is in place to address the under staffing in Dublin City Fire Brigade resulting in an overreliance on overtime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[48735\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the staffing number for Dublin City Fire Brigade for the past five years in tabular form.","asker":"1560","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[48736\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there has been an increase in the use of overtime used in Dublin City Fire Brigade over the past five years; his views on whether this is obscuring a staffing shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 53 and 54 together.<\/p>  <p>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire\/Rathdown County Councils. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I am aware that the most recent fire-fighter recruitment campaign  began in September 2019; all recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process. The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December to take up positions across the brigade in January 2022. A further third recruit class will begin training early in February 2022 with a start date for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruit&rsquo;s currently under review. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a statutory risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. That level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates. As this is Fire Safety Week 2021, I remind everybody of the importance of testing their smoke alarms regularly and I commend the kind of community fire safety initiatives aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society, which are undertaken by fire services and are seen a key driver of the welcome downward trends. <\/p>  <p>  Local Authority fire services in Ireland is staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel  in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service over the past number of years. The number of  frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission.  Unfortunately, the parties were not able to reach agreement on all the issues at this time, some of which are intended to alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements. I encourage all parties involved to re-engage and to continue to use the State's established statutory industrial relations machinery to resolve the issues concerned. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":157,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":158,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[48432\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600070#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the recent efforts made by his Department to highlight the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States of America; the progress made in relation to securing citizenship for them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>Addressing the situation of undocumented Irish emigrants in the US and working to secure legal pathways for Irish people wishing to live and work in the US have been priority issues for successive Governments and continue to be key priorities for the current Government.<\/p>  <p>  Immigration issues continue to be raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with US Administrations and political leaders. During his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit this year, the Taoiseach raised the matter directly with President Biden. I also raised immigration issues in my meetings on Capitol Hill during my most recent visit to Washington, DC.

A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  <\/p>  <p>  The Yellow Flag programme aims to support primary and secondary schools to become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.   While respecting schools' autonomy to participate in such programmes, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's &lsquo;Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  <\/p>  <p>  Last month, I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to provide an update on a number of issues including the measures that are being taken to prevent and tackle bullying in schools. <\/p>  <p>  During my appearance at the Joint Committee, I announced that my Department will commence a review of its 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools.  <\/p>  <p>  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying and identity based bullying, including gender identity and racist bullying<\/p>  <p>  This work will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students.<\/p>  <p>  I also announced that during this school year, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work will be a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary level. SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she\/he lives.  This junior cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in become active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and responsibilities, Global citizenship, and Exploring democracy. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Departments ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity\/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600071#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Policy","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600071#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[48505\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600071#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to introduce mental health and resilience modules in secondary education for transition year students and leaving certificate students; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>My Department has an important role to play in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of our young people.

Under the special educational needs model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritized on their individual needs. <\/p>  <p>  Parents\/guardians should engage with the Principal of their child&rsquo;s school or the school&rsquo;s SEN co-ordinator to discuss their child&rsquo;s needs and to consider requesting a consultation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.<\/p>  <p>  A NEPS assessment is not required for the pupil concerned to access learning supports. In September 2017 a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools was introduced.  The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs. This model differs from the previous system whereby pupils were allocated a prescribed number of resource teaching hours on the basis of a named disability. The new model gives schools the capacity to respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.   This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600071#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Equipment","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600071#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[48738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600071#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a CO2 monitor to each ASD classroom in the country; the estimated cost for this provision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>Good ventilation was identified as an important aspect of public health advice on managing Covid-19 risks and this led to the establishment of an Expert Group by the Department of Health.

The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in ETB Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. <\/p>  <p>  Phase 2 electrical apprenticeship provision is delivered across all 16 ETBs. Phase 2 apprentices commence off-the-job training throughout the year with apprentices called to the next available training place, regardless as to the home location of the apprentice.  Whilst every effort is made to eliminate unnecessary travel, unfortunately for some apprentices it is impossible to avoid having to attend training facilities that are not convenient to their locality. All apprentices are advised at their mandatory induction briefings of the training process.<\/p>  <p>  Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course.  At the end of August 2021, there were 3,000 electrical apprentices waiting for access to phase 2 off-the-job training.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support apprentices progress their off-the-job training in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>  Specific actions relating to the provision of Phase 2 off-the-job training are as follows:-<\/p>  <p>   - Craft apprentice off-the-job training was prioritised for a return to on-site learning across further and higher education institutions as COVID restrictions allowed.   <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This has facilitated an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand.  <\/p>  <p>  - A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is in delivery. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.<\/p>  <p>  The additional investment in supports, as well as training providers re-commencing in September at full capacity will mean that by the end of December 2021 over one third of the phase 2 apprentices will have returned to training. The waiting list for Phase 2 apprentices is expected to be completely cleared by the end of 2022.  It is not possible at this point to provide information on scheduling dates for individual apprentices as work is ongoing to maximise the level of provision across the country.<\/p>  <p>  A public update issued on www.apprenticeship.ie on 23rd September which outlined the comprehensive programme of work underway and to ensure that information is available to apprentices, employers and prospective apprentices.

and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>Enabling people with care-needs to continue to live independently at home for as long as possible is a priority for the Government. To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs.<\/p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.  <\/p><p>With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.  <\/p><p>In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. <\/p><p>Mobilisation of the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery is expected to commence in November. The pilot will deliver an additional 230,000 hours of home-support in four community healthcare network (CHN) sites over a six-month period. The pilot sites are: (CHO 2) Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea (CHO 4) Bandon, Kinsale and Carrigaline (CHO 7) Ballyfermot and Palmerstown (CHO 8) East Westmeath. <\/p><p>130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care-needs and recruitment for these posts is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, a National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year. <\/p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023 commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services. <\/p><p>In relation to home support service provision, data which has been provided since the cyber-attack is provisional and subject to change - at the end of August 2021, the preliminary data indicates that about 13.2 million home support hours had been provided to 53,905 people. This is about 2 million more hours compared to the same period last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF05500"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[48420\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of HSE employed home help staff under CHO2 for counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon; the current annual budget for each county; the calculated HSE delivery care cost per hour compared to outsourced or private providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF05800"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[48421\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if work has commenced on legislation to recognise the recent European Court of Justice ruling on levels of THC in CBD products and their classification as narcotics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>The matters raised are currently the subject of legal proceedings and consequently, being sub-judice, I am not in a position to offer further comment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600072#WRF06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600073#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[48426\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600073#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the lack of nurses and careers in Limerick city and county for facilities such as respite care units in the communities the lack of nurses is delaying the opening of such services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600073#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600073#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[48427\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100600073#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if discussions are expected to prioritise funding for mental health services in Limerick in Budget 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>The Department is engaging in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE in relation to the 2022 Estimates.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre-cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of August 2021 there were 4,511 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 5,528 in August 2019.<\/p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF.
