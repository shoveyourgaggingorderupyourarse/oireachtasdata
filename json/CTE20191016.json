We are already experiencing the effects of climate change.  Moreover, no matter how successful we are in our efforts to mitigate them, those effects will get worse over the next 50 years because of historical and continuing global greenhouse gas emissions.  The impacts of climate change often seem distant from everyday life but, in recent years, we have experienced several extreme weather events, the cumulation of which clearly shows the adverse consequences of changes in our climate.  Public awareness of the need for adaptation remains low.  Adaptation is not only a matter for Government but will require an even greater response and investment by households and the business sector in planning for higher temperatures, flooding and so on.  While sectoral and local adaptation strategies have been developed, we have identified gaps in respect of coastal areas, housing and planning.  These areas have not been properly addressed under the current plans.<\/p> <p>  Robust carbon pricing is essential to support action by individuals and businesses to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.  While it will directly encourage households and businesses to reduce emissions, the major effect will come from encouraging investment in low-carbon or zero-carbon technologies, including in heating and cars.  That is where the real pay-off will come.  The revenue raised should be used to ensure a just transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable economy and society.  We welcome the budget provision of &euro;90 million for that purpose.  The Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, had recommended that the carbon tax be raised to &euro;35 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in budget 2020, increasing to at least &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  Nevertheless, the modest increase in carbon tax announced last week is welcome.  While the Minister expressed the view that similar increases should continue every year until 2030, it would have been better if that commitment had been enshrined in legislation.  The commitment in this committee's report to such a strategy is welcome and offers an assurance that we are beginning a journey in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  This year's budget began the process of ring-fencing revenue to support a just transition.  Urgent actions are necessary in the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors.  The council has given particular attention to these sectors, which we outlined in a special chapter in our annual review.  We recognise that opportunities exist to reduce emissions while, at the same time, safeguarding farm incomes and providing multiple co-benefits to society.  Beef and dairy production in Ireland is relatively efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit product.  However, improvements in efficiency have not been able to keep pace with the observed increase in absolute emissions.  In recent years, the expansion of the national dairy herd has been a major contributor to increases in agricultural emissions.  Reduction of the suckler herd would make an important and cost-effective contribution to mitigation and could support alternative land uses such as increased woodland, raise farm incomes and reduce the exposure of the sector to external market shocks, including Brexit.  However, the dairy sector must also play its part through the implementation of technologies and management practices which reduce emissions.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is an important opportunity to design supports which will help farmers to restructure in a way that increases their income and rewards environmental and climate actions. <\/p> <p>  The CCAC is concerned about the low rates of afforestation achieved in recent years.  Research and policy innovations are required to overcome the barriers to afforestation.  It is only by talking to people who own the land that we can understand what those obstacles are.  Afforestation activity might look like a win-win on a spreadsheet but it is not happening and we need to work out why.  Each individual will have a different answer to that question.<\/p> <p>  The council has recommended that the Government publish a detailed plan for achieving its commitment to end the burning of coal at Moneypoint by 2025.  We also recommend the cessation of peat-fired electricity generation in 2020. <\/p> <p>  The construction and building sector is operating near full capacity.  There is an urgent need to increase its ability to deliver the necessary retrofit programme without impacting on the delivery of increased numbers of houses.  The Government should lead by example through investment in retrofitting local authority housing.  This would provide certainty to construction firms of a long-term commitment to retrofitting, as well as providing multiple benefits to low-income households and developing the capacity of the building construction sector to deliver for everybody who needs to upgrade a dwelling.<\/p> <p>  The CCAC welcomes the climate action plan as providing a significant step forward in tackling climate change.  The plan includes proposals for a wide range of measures and new governance arrangements which will enable us to meet our 2030 targets.  However, implementation in a cost-effective manner and robust governance of the implementation of the plan are critical if we are to realise our ambitions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Professor FitzGerald noted that beef and dairy production in Ireland is relatively efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit product.

The latter include changing fertiliser, which would reduce nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions.  It is a question of actually implementing those measures but, realistically, these things do not happen overnight.  If they could be done overnight, we probably would not be worrying as much about the size of the herd.  We expect they will be implemented gradually, but not fully, over the next decade, which could leave a gap.  At the moment, as we all are aware, beef farmers are making nothing net out of their work and Brexit is likely to make that situation much worse.  My understanding is that for many farmers, shifting some of their land to less intensive farming - using some of it for woodland, for example - could increase their incomes.  It might also provide a more secure income.  I have been working in agricultural economics for 43 years and beef farming has always been a difficult business.<\/p> <p>  With Brexit and with artificial beef coming along and a whole range of other issues, reducing the herd could secure farmers' income and lead to a substantial reduction in emissions.  The problem is how to implement that change.  I am 70 this month and if I were asked to turn into a farmer tomorrow, it would not happen.  Likewise, it is not easy for beef farmers to turn into foresters and it will not happen overnight.  This is something the farming community will do because it wants to do it and because it sees that it will be profitable and manageable.  We need to look at overcoming the obstacles if we are to facilitate a transition that could be a win-win for farmers and for climate action.  Such a transition can make a major contribution but it will not happen overnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Professor FitzGerald for his presentation and his ongoing work in advising us in his role as chairman of the council.  The priority recommendations in the committee's report impose a large degree of the encumbrance of the work that needs to be done on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and on Teagasc.  We must see those bodies being held to account.  I am confident the Department will deliver in this regard.  In fact, one of the best presentations to the committee was from that Department, which showed a clear understanding of the scale of the problem.<\/p><p>We need to see actions and timelines to implement and promote the uptake of these measures, particularly the mitigation measures and the pathways mentioned by Teagasc.  We need movement on that.<\/p><p> I am taken by the witnesses' analysis and think it is on the money regarding what is happening in agriculture.  There is an intensification in the dairy sector in recognition of market demand.  At a recent conference I attended, I heard somebody from the dairy sector talking about a 30% increase in the dairy cow herd in the past three to four years.  This person is working on the basis of a further 30% increase in the next four to five years.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p><p> There is a very specific reliance on the suckler beef herd on less good land, possibly more as a way of life than as a means to an income.  This cannot be underestimated.  Professor FitzGerald's final comment probably spoke to that.  Turning a suckler beef farmer into a forester will not happen.  There is a connection with the land and the production, purchase and sale of animals that is a way of life.  It is like telling a musician to go and play basketball.  It is as stark as that for farmers in that sector.  The overintensification on the dairy side has a very significant knock-on effect.  Notwithstanding the emissions related to it, it is having a very considerable knock-on effect because it is increasing supply into the beef market and reducing the price.  Have the witnesses any views on the strategy around our dairy herd and dairy output?  How do they view that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#C00500","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>What we say is that we really do not have space to increase significantly the dairy herd and its related emissions in the coming decade.  If that happened, we would need a dramatic reduction in the beef herd.  The Deputy made the point that they are not totally separable.  Calves are produced in dairy herds and end up in beef herds.  We would be concerned that the agricultural emissions targets would not be met if there was a 30% increase in the dairy herd.  That would pose major challenges to the sector in terms of meeting its targets.<\/p> <p>  Interesting work is ongoing in terms of how, without changing a way of life, we can reduce emissions or increase the amount of carbon being fixed.  One thing worth looking at that is being researched is increasing hedgerows so that we use them instead of barbed wire.  A certain amount of land will be used but the hedgerows may fix carbon.  That is an option that would not require a change of life.  I am not saying that is a solution but research on it is ongoing.  It could be interesting and would be compatible with existing farming practices.<\/p> <p>  Research is ongoing in Armagh into planting trees in pasture at intervals.  The trees suck up the moisture when it is very wet in winter and farmers may be able to have their cattle out for 12 weeks longer, which brings about a significant reduction in NOx emissions.  There higher NOx emissions when cattle are inside.  Feeding cattle is expensive over winter.  There are things that can be done.  Further work that has not yet been factored in could see progress.  Going back to the really important issue raised by the Deputy, a large increase in the dairy herd would pose major problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We have to look at that.  Regarding land use and management, we need to have a plan in place for the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to capture that money.  In my constituency office, I deal on an ongoing basis with farmers whose payments are cut because they overdeclared for a parcel of land that in the minds of those in the Department was not in active farming.  It was not in grassland.  When the satellite passed over and took a picture of the land, there was an area of scrub so the Department sought to exclude that and, therefore, reduce the area for which the farmer claimed.  This has a knock-on effect on the farmer's payment because he or she is not regarded as actively farming the land.  In truth, the area that has perhaps gone wild and is not grazeable is of greater benefit in terms of biodiversity and carbon capture in the long run.  We have a lot to do in terms of that because we are forcing an unnecessary clearing of that land whereas farmers seem to be happy enough with.  Perhaps it is poor land in the first instance where not much grass can be grown.

We cannot just leave them there.  The question arises as to whether CAP should provide some compensation for farmers who manage peatlands in a manner that does us all a service by stocking carbon dioxide.

I am not defending one way or the other.  I agree with what Professor FitzGerald is saying.  He talks about moving away from the suckler herd to afforestation, but at the same time, he mentions displacement of beef that has been produced efficiently, as he rightly noted, by imported beef from Brazil, where they are cutting down rain forests.  How do we overcome that argument with the farmer, because an element of, to use an abrupt word, stubbornness kicks in at that stage?  While farmers might see the logic in what Professor FitzGerald is saying and see the financial benefits, they will ask why they should be reducing their herds that have come to them from their fathers and grandfathers, because as Deputy Dooley noted, it is a tradition in families, when all this is happening across the globe.  This is a global issue.  If we solve our problems in Ireland, how much of a factor will it be in the overall picture?

From talking to younger farmers, I can say that they see more of the logic in this.  Those of us who are parents and grandparents may be influenced by our children to change our ways as we get older.  We are not looking for an overnight revolution.  We are looking for an evolution over an 11-year period as people realise that they might be able to do better through farming in a different way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I have come across some of the issues, including scrub, hedging and incorrect declarations of land, in my constituency office as well.

What is Professor FitzGerald's view of the dairy industry?  He mentioned where he thought it would go and the most appropriate way it could develop over the next decade.  It will probably be one of the key issues for the question of affordability.  Consider what the commodity market is doing in terms of farming.  Given production costs, the money realistically will be made in dairy.  That is why there has been an influx of farmers, in particular younger ones, into dairy production from beef outlets.  Could changes in dairy practices form a major part of the expansion?  We use terms like \"anaerobic digestion\" and have policies to ensure a biogas network is built so that excess slurry and grass can be used to generate energy.  Could a combination of anaerobic digestion and an expansion of the dairy herd allow rural Ireland to be profitable?  There is a global drive for dairy products at the moment but no such global drive for beef products.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean to be rude about it, but forestry in certain parts of the country is considered to be on bad land.

Speaking as someone from Offaly in the midlands, where a third of our county is peat soil and has been used for harvesting turf for electricity generation for decades, the future of the peatlands is at the forefront of my mind.  A certain amount of the boglands is being rehabilitated and restored by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Bord na M&oacute;na has completed harvesting except on some bogs.  Given that its main client no longer requires as much peat as was intended, though, a serious issue arises in that regard.  Private operators are harvesting peat for horticultural use and exports to the UK and so on.  Has the Climate Change Advisory Council had an opportunity to consider how all of that will be managed in terms of the rehabilitation and restoration that are required?  If the boglands are not being used for harvesting as they were in the past, how much carbon can be saved?  I believe that the average figure for carbon sequestered by peatlands throughout the country is 57,400 tonnes per year, which is significant.

Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy from Teagasc appeared before us.  We considered the questions of food and carbon emissions from our beef industry.  One issue that arose related to how most of the plant-based protein foods that we might rely on as alternatives to meat were imported.  This was striking.  None of those foods that one buys from Tesco or some other shops is made in Ireland.  My understanding is that our soil and climate are not best suited to the types of crop in question.  Such crops would have to be imported.  If they are coming from the tropics, then we are talking about developing countries that face their own food shortage challenges and about the carbon footprint of bringing the food to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Dr. McCarthy expanded on the notions that we were best placed to get our protein from meat and dairy as opposed to beans and other plant-based protein crops, given that our cattle were grass fed, and that, as one got older, one would have to eat more beans to meet one's protein requirements compared with meat.  Perhaps these are not matters that the council has considered, but they need further discussion.  The issue of food is emotive and the debate has not been expanded upon enough.  The debate has been slanted by people who have not looked into it enough, and while there is a bigger discussion in the round, beef is getting a bashing.

Taking Deputy Neville's and Senator Mulherin's together, Ireland has set an obligation to reduce our emissions by 2030.  While we are more efficient than many other countries, we are less efficient than some.  The council's supplementary working paper shows that, although Ireland is top of the class in some cases, it is not in others.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the issue of carbon efficiency and what is coming down the tracks, particularly in terms of what Senator Mulherin mentioned.  In July, I was babysitting my grandchildren in Boston.  I took my 11 year old grandson and my seven year old granddaughter to the Museum of Science, which is one of the best in the world.  There were two 15-minute lectures on that afternoon.  My grandson stated that he wanted to go to one on synthetic biology and another on climate change.  The former was well delivered and my grandson got all the issues.  I did too, and I learned a certain amount.  It covered how DNA had been transferred from beef to vegetable matter, specifically soya, and how beef was now being produced from that matter.  <i>The Vegan Times<\/i>panned it, saying it was awful because it tasted just like beef.<br\/><br\/>The next day, my grandson said he wanted a falafel sandwich.  He knew a place near the children's hospital.<\/p><p>I took him there and he got his falafel sandwich but they were selling burgers with artificial beef.  I did not try one as I did not fancy it and nor did he but two weeks ago, Barclays said that, within the next ten years, 10% of the world's beef would be met from artificial beef, which we will not be able to tell from real beef.  The beef sector will be under huge pressure and if 10% of the world's supply is taken out by a cheaper alternative, the worldwide market will be much more difficult.  Farmers in six states of the United States have got together to lobby for Burger King to have to label artificial beef as such, because they are very concerned.  There will be knock-on effects because of the relationship between milk and beef, which Deputy Dooley identified.<\/p><p> Senator Mulherin asked about imports.  Two thirds of everything on our supermarket shelves are made in the United Kingdom or imported through the United Kingdom.  We produce dramatically more beef than we need to feed ourselves.  The agriculture sector has to look at these issues independently of issues around climate change.  Climate change will not be the saviour but it could be the reason compensation is paid to farmers to transition out of the sector.  Senator Lombard asked about offsetting with anaerobic digestion.  Teagasc has assumed all these things happen with a stable dairy herd, which is necessary to meet the target.  It would not allow us to increase the dairy herd and it is taken for granted that we will implement all these measures to reduce costs and emissions if we are to meet our target.  I do not see it as a get-out-of-jail card.<\/p><p> It was suggested that farmers be required to have a proportion of their land in forestry.  As a non-farmer, I am reluctant to force farmers to do anything and it would be better to try to persuade farmers that it is in their best interests to do it.  The CAP can be framed in different ways and there may be mandatory elements but we have not got involved in that.<\/p><p> Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked about peat.  Co-firing is not an answer because if the biomass comes from Ireland, it can be much more effectively used for heating in rural areas.  If it is imported, it is a double no.  In any event, a lot of peat would be consumed anyway and the combined emissions would still be awful.  I take the point that bringing forward the closure to today is very disruptive.  Bord na M&oacute;na was planning for a longer term.  I was down on bogs in Offaly and Kildare to look at what is involved and it was brought home to me that we cannot just abandon bogs - we have to manage them.

There is &euro;20 million which has been put aside in the budget for developing a retrofitting capacity in the midlands.  One option could be for some of the workers to be trained to provide this service so that we would keep the activity and keep employment in the midlands.  It is an innovative idea for using some of the &euro;90 million in revenue.  Bord na M&oacute;na showed me a number of things it is doing to prepare for alternative employment but these are not ready yet.  From an environmental point of view, it was important to bring forward the closure of the bogs but how it is handled is important as a demonstration that climate change will not impose massive costs on a particular community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>We will move to the next group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#F00200","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#F00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Was one of the Senator's questions not answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#F00400","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It is very important.

It is a question of how we incentivise private homeowners and those in local authority houses.  I put it to Professor FitzGerald that if we do not have an entire figure for what has been allocated to retrofit houses, it is difficult to do an assessment of what we could allocate per house.  Does the advisory council have a perspective on how we would finance that?  I suggest that it must be part grant and possibly part savings.

The State cannot pick up the tab.  It would require a major increase in taxation or a reduction in other services to do it.  That is a big ask.  The question is how best to go about it.<\/p> <p>  Many people are prepared to spend their own money but do not how to do it.  I have talked to a significant number of people about the problems in doing it.  The &euro;20 million ring-fenced for the midlands is a beginning to the strategy.  We know the State owns 100,000 or 150,000 local authority dwellings.  As the landlord, the obligation is on the State to upgrade those dwellings.  We could begin there and offer several contracts to upgrade 1,000 local authority dwellings next year.  The number the following year could increase to 2,000 and then 5,000 after that.  In that way, a builder can know that if he specialises in that area, he will have a growing volume of activity.<\/p> <p>  There is one case in Kilkenny.  Kilkenny County Council upgraded a local authority estate.  It got an engineer and sourced a builder.  Since the council was doing a large number of houses together, it got a good deal.  An engineer checked that the specifications were right and the job was done correctly.  What happened was that the private owners of the former local authority houses in the estate asked if they could pay for their houses to be retrofitted too.  They were prepared to pay for their houses to be done because the hard work had been done by the council.  That is the model.  We should begin with the local authority dwellings.  It has the benefit that, on average, people in local authority dwellings are less well off than people in the community as a whole.  Also, many of them are elderly and may not spend enough on heating.  If we upgrade their dwellings, it may lead to a health improvement.  There will certainly be an income distribution benefit.  Moreover, we help to develop the capacity for the rest of the community.  That is why we have suggested beginning there.<\/p> <p>  Giving me a grant to do up my house is a waste of money.  For many people, the problems of doing up the house and the disruption are a far greater concern.  I wrote about how my wife and I did a job on our house a decade ago.  We probably need to do another one.  It was driven by my wife because she said we needed to be ready for our wheelchairs.  The chaos in the house was something else.  I will not say it caused a divorce - happily, we have been married for more than 40 years - but the disruption to life in making the change was significant.  If a homeowner upgrades the house to a BER A2 rating, it may be necessary to put in underfloor heating.  That means taking everything down.  We need to look at how to do this in the least disruptive fashion and help people to do it.  I will go back to what I said about schemes with farmers.  We need to understand the obstacles first.  We should begin with local authority dwellings where there are multiple benefits, spend the scarce resources there and see how we get on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I agree with the last point made by Professor FitzGerald on the benefits of retrofitting local authority houses.  I see this in my area and it is an extraordinary benefit to people.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on the principle of carbon taxes.  It is something of an accepted narrative that where countries have introduced a significant carbon tax, emissions have declined significantly.  I put it to Professor FitzGerald that there are other explanations for the decline in emissions in some of the models we looked at, including British Colombia and Norway.  Some of it had to do with industry switching from coal to gas, outsourcing to other industries or periods of recession when manufacturing was at low levels.  There is a lack of evidence showing that significant increases in carbon tax actually reduce emissions.<\/p><p>A considerable part of it is because, as we just heard, carbon tax does not change the behaviour of people who cannot afford to change their behaviour.<\/p><p> Professor FitzGerald's former colleagues in the ERSI told us here at a separate meeting that they disagreed with the model of carbon tax that the Government is introducing.  They favoured a fee and dividend model.  We have a problem here, however.  I refer to part of the admiration Professor FitzGerald has given this committee for the work we have done on the carbon tax.  One of our key priority recommendations was to advise the Government to conduct a fuel poverty survey of the country to establish the levels of fuel poverty, not only by looking at who gets fuel allowance but more broadly, and to come back to us then about the carbon tax.  The Government never conducted that.  I ask Professor FitzGerald to comment on that.  Should the Government do so now?<\/p><p> It was not the only key recommendation we made on carbon tax.  Recommendation No. 4 argued that an inquiry should be conducted into the revenue that could be realised through the introduction of a carbon tax on the profits of corporations directly linked to the production and sale of gas, oil and coal and other fossil fuels.  As an economist, does Professor FitzGerald think there could be a model of tax that would disincentivise the fossil fuel corporations, the hedge funds and the investment banks which benefit from all the fossil fuel corporations and their behaviour, and could we use the taxation system to effect necessary change from them?  I have one more question presently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#H01500","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>There is a significant body of evidence that carbon taxes work.  Deputy Boyd Barrett put this issue to me in June at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  I talked to one of the experts on the area and there is research which showed it worked in British Columbia.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith quite correctly states that much is going on simultaneously and one needs fairly sophisticated economic research to separate out the effects.  Since 1992, there is a paper a year from the ESRI on this subject.  There is a vast literature out there.  Professor William Nordhaus, who won the Nobel price for economics last year, is another of these people who have done work on it.  This is not just an issue in Ireland, but across the world.<\/p> <p>  If one raises the price, one changes investment behaviour.  For example, Volkswagen is not necessarily a nice company.  The company is investing heavily in electric cars because it sees the taxation on fossil fuels going up all of the time.  The company will go out of business if it does not produce a cheaper alternative.  In Ireland, within three years, one will be able to buy electric cars as the cheap alternative.  The price changes the decision on investment in a crucial way.  If one looks at Dublin's taxis, how many Toyota Prius cars are there?  The reason is not necessarily that taxi drivers care more about climate change than the rest of us.  It is because it is the cheap solution given the price of fuel.  In particular, higher prices discourage one from burning fossil fuels; it is an investment decision.<\/p> <p>  On housing, why do people retrofit their houses?  Many of those who have done so to date have probably wanted to do the right thing, but one will not have this level of investment unless by so doing people save money because it is the saving of money that will finance future investment.  Going back to Deputy Sherlock, there is a model in The Netherlands, which works there, where they will retrofit one's house for free providing they can make the savings on energy over the subsequent 30 years.  I am not sure that model would work well here but it might be worth looking at.<\/p> <p>  People make the change because it is the cheap solution.  The evidence is universal that this works.  It is the investment decision that is important.  The reason we want to see a promise to ramp it up over time is so that when the Deputy goes out and buys her next car, even if the petrol car is cheaper, the Deputy will know that over the lifetime of the car she would be better off with an electric car.

Dr. Roantree, if one looks at the model there, recommended a broader change in social welfare.

One of its roles is to provide policy evaluation to Government based on the best available science.  My question pertains to the advice that Professor FitzGerald provided to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the future of gas and oil exploration in a letter date 20 September 2019.  Professor FitzGerald used what he called &quot;compelling&quot; evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, about the combustion of known reserves of natural gas.  That line was used to justify the continued exploration for oil and gas, and especially gas, off our shores.  The scientists Professor FitzGerald is supposed to refer to, such as those in Oil Change International, have told us they have seen the letter and that there was particular isolated use of the letter.  One of the points Professor FitzGerald stated is that natural gas has been identified internationally as an important transitional fuel.  The scientists state that there is a formidable body of evidence to show that they have a diametrically opposed position.  The response of oil and gas was to state that the letter that Professor FitzGerald used considering each fossil fuel in isolation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>carbon budgets has no reasonable scientific basis.  I have every respect for Professor FitzGerald and his job, but his council is made up mainly of economists, not of scientists.  Professor FitzGerald's role to use the best science available to advise the Government was not properly used in this case, particularly in relation to gas exploration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#J01500","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The note the Deputy mentioned was a piece of evidence we considered.  However, we also considered a wide range of other evidence.  There are two particular issues.  The first is how to get to zero net emissions by 2050.  The work done by University College Cork, UCC, suggests that, given known technology, the only way we will get there by 2050 is if we balance a very large amount of wind and solar with gas-fired generation incorporating carbon capture and storage so that there will be no emissions from the use of gas.  We need some kind of technology.  Technological developments may give rise to alternatives, but not at the moment.  Gas will be needed beyond 2050.  The UCC study is not unique.  Our sister organisation in the United Kingdom, the Committee on Climate Change, which has more resources and is much further advanced than we are, has identified the same issue in the context of how to address the intermittent availability of renewable sources of energy.  Said intermittent availability means that we need gas.  To meet the 2050 target, we have an urgent task to turn transport around .  We are concerned that the target set may not be achievable unless there is a dramatic change in policy on electric cars.  The technology is not yet available for electric heavy goods vehicles.  However, the move to compressed natural gas will substantially reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide from heavy goods vehicles and will greatly reduce emissions in urban areas which are damaging to health.  Gas will be needed.  That is the first set of evidence.  We have considered evidence from UCC, the UK Committee on Climate Change and work done elsewhere in Europe on that.<\/p> <p>  The second set of evidence relates to a series of papers dating back over a number of years.  We did not do a note on this.  I authored the 2015 paper and it was published by the ESRI.  The paper was commissioned by the Department of Finance a year and a half before Brexit and it related to the implications of the latter for Ireland.  The ESRI published a series of papers in November 2015, including one by me on the implications for energy.  It is the last of a string of papers by the ESRI over 15 years on the security of the Irish energy system.  The concern has been that if the gas disappeared tomorrow, the lights would go off and we would be left to freeze.  We doubled the capacity of the gas interconnector between Ireland and Scotland.  We then paid for a doubling of the onshore gas pipeline in Scotland to protect ourselves.  However, the advent of Brexit raises an issue.  If, for example, there was a major interruption in the gas supply in Austria, which would affect all of Europe, under EU law, if there is a shortage of gas, member states must share it.  However, the UK leaving the EU will mean that there is a state between us and the EU.  I am old enough to remember the Suez crisis when they kept the oil for themselves when there was a shortage and the same applied during the Second World War.  If there was an interruption or a shortage of supply in Europe, we could be cut off as a result.  That would leave us , which leaves us insecure.  Last week, National Grid published a paper voicing concern about the security of supply in Britain because if there was a shortage in the rest of Europe, it could be cut off.  Under EU law, it is protected but that will no longer be the case.<\/p> <p>  Security of supply is not just an issue for Ireland.  How should we deal with that matter?  Previously, we doubled the pipeline.  While the Corrib Field will remain in operation for the next decade, we have an alternative supply.  We might not have it for heating, but would have it for net essential electricity if it was cut off.  What do we do when the Corrib runs out?  We could have an LNG terminal somewhere and bring in LNG or if we discovered gas, it would be of value in terms of security of supply.  It seemed to us that there is little benefit to Ireland in drilling for oil.  With gas, there is a potential benefit from the perspective of security of supply.  Irrespective of what we do, it will make no difference to Ireland's emissions, which is our primary remit.  I have a concern in the context of spending too much time on this issue, which will not affect our emissions.  It is a distraction.  We are far behind and we need to make big efforts.  Devoting considerable time to this issue will make no difference to our emissions.  We have answered the question and I have given the committee the evidence on which our decision was based.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut Professor FitzGerald off.

The environmental movement globally wants to move away from putting all the emphasis on individual responsibility and concentrate on tackling the problem at source.  That is why we are fixated and interested in keeping fossil fuels in the ground.<\/p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald is right in saying there is an issue of security because of what is happening in the UK.  In lengthy discussions with people involved in that process in the past three years, I have never heard anyone state that the UK negotiators are considering weakening the energy security arrangements or co-operation in respect of energy.  As the professor indicated, the UK is absolutely exposed because its North Sea offshore gas flows are decreasing by 7% or 8% per year.  The UK is critically dependent on Norwegian and continental gas connections for its security.  That issue can be and I believe will be addressed in whatever Brexit outcome arises.  If the UK tries to operate as an isolated system, it will be left with the most incredibly expensive electricity, in particular, which will kill its digital and other industries.  The alternative to such investment in gas infrastructure is in electricity interconnection to allow that balancing capability on a big scale.  This is big thinking.  That would be a much more secure investment because investing in fossil fuel must stop now.<\/p> <p>  What Professor FitzGerald said about the budget is true.  There is no clarity coming from the Department of Finance.  In the area of transport, for example, it is just given as a lump sum for land-use transport.  There is no breakdown between public transport and roads.  I have asked the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Parliamentary Budget Office if they could answer that question but they have never been able to do it.<\/p> <p>  Let us put aside the existing expenditure.  I know that is a bad habit in our budgets.  We are always looking at the new.  What is new in the budget is that we provided a potential &euro;1.5 billion as a cash payment to businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit and we gave &euro;90 million to climate action.  Would it not have been far better to give &euro;1.5 billion to climate action in a way that would also have protected those sectors most at risk from Brexit to pay farmers to do as Professor FitzGerald suggested and take the corner part of a field to plant native forestry, which a farmer could do.  They would be learning forestry by doing that.  They could also cut the hedgerows.  We could also invest radically in cycling and walking infrastructure or in apprenticeships to allow young people to build up expertise for retrofitting.  Was Professor FitzGerald disappointed with the budget in that context?

However, it makes sense to use the money to help farmers transition out of sectors that are very badly affected, such as beef, into other sectors.<\/p><p>I would not write off all of that &euro;800 million as being non-climate sensitive.  It is temporary.  Obviously, I would have liked there to have been more.  My concern is that it is difficult to identify in the investment.  If one thinks about the investment in housing, it is in local authority housing or social housing where all the houses have a BER of A.  It is not like the cost of retrofitting but embedded in that is a significant amount of additional expenditure, which is related to moving the BER from, let us say, C to A.  It is very difficult to identify what relates to climate change in the investment programme.  Is climate change the reason for much of the investment in public transport?  It is good for climate change but it is being done to get people from A to B because of congestion.  It is difficult to break down, but it would be a help if the Government did provide a breakdown.

My second question relates to land use.  Professor FitzGerald referred to 40 years of agricultural economics.  As he stated, it is really difficult for us to change habits.  This committee recommended in its report the merits of a national land use plan, not just in respect of farming but also the restoration of peatlands, and the importance of that in respect to flood management, the protection of the wilderness and the restoration of nature.  To my mind, we would move towards a completely different forestry model not just composed of commercial plantations because we face a biodiversity crisis as well as a climate crisis.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc seem to have set themselves stridently against such an overview plan.

I accept that the timing is different.  As Professor FitzGerald is aware, there are differences of opinion on the extent to which carbon taxing incentivises us or engages us in behavioural changes.  That is not the rationale used in the context of its introduction.  The core economic rationale has been environmental externality and the fact that the social and environmental costs of fossil fuels have been borne by society and, in effect, we have subsidised an artificial commodity price over a long period.  That is the rationale that was used in terms of initially bringing in the carbon tax.  Given that that is the rationale, should it not be the case that every penny of the carbon tax, not the increase, which is attached to an incentive logic, all of the &euro;35 for example, be ring-fenced to deal with those external costs such as mitigation and adaptation?

We are adding 75 cent on natural gas at the moment, versus the increase in carbon tax.  If that is the case, I accept that.  I will come back to Professor FitzGerald.<\/p> <p>  I was very surprised about the letter the council sent to the Department.  I was not just surprised by the content of the letter but its timing.  The council is an independent body responsible for reviewing policy.  The timing of the letter was very strange, politically, just before a statement, and it did not seem to reflect the council's own review, which is what we are discussing here, the annual review of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  In the sections on energy, there were not lengthy opinions on the role of gas and continued gas exploration.  That was not something that had been analysed in detail but seemed to be closer to the letter from 2015.  It was said the combustion of all known reserves of natural gas globally would not in itself exceed 1.5&deg;C.  Obviously, any one measure is not enough but the key concern is that it contributes to the overall level.<\/p> <p>  The other issues that were mentioned were carbon capture and storage.  The evidence we heard last week is that methane has a quicker rate of absorption, that, in fact, it can narrow the period that we have and that carbon dioxide has a longer lag time in the context of absorption.  Are we effectively shortening the window of time by taking this approach?  It is not a bridge, rather it shortens the road we are on.<\/p><p>First of all, the science on methane is different from that relating to CO2.  It is currently converted at a particular rate but methane disappears from the atmosphere in ten to 12 years, whereas CO2 is there forever.  That makes carbon dioxide the primary focus.  The metric treats them as equivalent for the 2030 targets.  I refer the committee to the range of caveats in our letter as to how the gas is used.<\/p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about the issue of timing at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Taoiseach and the Minister have also asked about it.  There seemed to be a broad political interest in answering that question.  In terms of preparation for the meeting, because the council have very scarce resources, I did not get the secretariat to prepare a paper covering all the other evidence but we are aware of other evidence.  I dispute the suggestion that everything turns on the briefing note because that was a briefing note on one set of evidence.

It is an honour to be able to present some of the key findings from the report.  In the interests of time, I will not go through this presentation in detail but I will refer to some of the graphical elements from the summary for policymakers.  I will show those on the screen as I go.<\/p> <p>  The IPCC&rsquo;s special report on climate change and land was approved by governments in Geneva in August 2019.  It is the second of three special reports of the current IPCC assessment cycle, building on the special report on global warming of 1.5&deg;C approved in 2018.  The report was prepared under the scientific leadership of all three IPCC working groups including the task force on national greenhouse gas inventories.  This came at the request of seven member governments - including Ireland, it is important to note - for a report focusing specifically on land and its interactions with climate change.  The report was prepared by 107 experts from 52 countries and was the first IPCC report with a majority of authors, 53%, from developing countries.<\/p> <p>  The following is a summary of some of the key messages.  Land is a critical resource upon which we all rely but it is under increasing pressure from humans and climate change.  Through sustainable management, land can be an important part of the solution to climate change but land cannot do it all.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors is essential if global warming is to be kept to well below 2&deg;C.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline some of the key messages from the summary for policymakers.  I should point out that this summary condenses the assessment of seven chapters of the main report and if any member of the committee wants further detail on any sections, I am happy to direct them to the right chapter.<\/p> <p>  Starting with the current situation, the report assessed key trends in terms of climate change and land use and many of these are summarised in figure SPM1.  Humans affect more than 70% of the ice-free land area and a quarter of that land is already in a degraded state.  In 2015, approximately 500 million people lived in areas undergoing desertification.  That is an increase of 300% since 1961 and therefore one can see that the effects of climate change are exacerbating the situation.<\/p> <p>  Population growth, changes in consumption of food, feed, fibre, timber and energy have caused unprecedented rates of land and fresh water use in the past 50 years.  Since 1961, cereal yields, for example, have increased by 240% globally but so too has the intensity of land use.<\/p><p>Over the same period, there has been an increase of approximately 800% in the rate of nitrogen fertilizer used.  There has also been an increase in ruminant livestock numbers globally.  Consequently, there has been an increase in both methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture &ndash; both of which are potent greenhouse gases.  Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human greenhouse gas emissions.  At the same time, on the other side of the equation, natural land processes absorb almost one third of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry.  The report found that natural carbon sinks and their capacity to continue to store carbon are under threat from climate change and unsustainable land management.  It also found that the way we produce food, what we eat, and food loss and food waste all contribute to climate change, the loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity.  <\/p><p> To move on to some of the risks assessed, the report assessed risks to human and natural systems as a function of increasing global mean surface temperature.  This is shown visually in figure SPM.2 in my submission.  Current levels of warming are associated with moderate risks for soil erosion, vegetation loss, coastal degradation and tropical crop yield decline.  These are the risks we are already experiencing.  At around 2&deg;C of global warming, risks from permafrost degradation and food supply instabilities are projected to be very high.  It is also important to consider risks as a function of trends in population and consumption.  The report also did this by looking at socioeconomic pathways.  It found that pathways with higher demand and lower levels of technological development are associated with higher risks of land degradation, food insecurity and desertification.  Further details on pathways and how they look in terms of land use change are also provided in the report, but I will not get into that now, although I can do so if the committee would find it useful.<\/p><p> The report also considered what can be done, that is, solutions.  This is one of the most important parts of the report.  It looked at solutions in terms of integrated response options to address climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, tackling desertification and land degradation and improving food security.  This is shown visually in the table, figure SPM.3.  In the interests of time I will go through this quickly and focus on some of the key messages.  The message is positive in that many of the response options are positive across all categories.  Positive options are highlighted in blue in the submission.  Many are at an advanced technology level and many can be undertaken at a relatively low cost.  One message to take away is that there is much we can do right now.<\/p><p> The report considered the food system as a whole, that is, both demand and supply.  Many response options with regard to production could be applied or upscaled in Ireland.  These include improved livestock and pasture management, agricultural diversification, agroforestry, increased productivity through sustainable intensification, and increasing soil carbon.  Protection of current carbon stocks and restoration of high carbon ecosystems, which are identified as response options in the table, are applicable in respect of Ireland's peatlands.<\/p><p> On the demand side, the report found that dietary choices present an important route to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pressures on land.  Some dietary choices require more land and water and cause more greenhouse gas emissions than others.  Balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods and animal sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low greenhouse gas emission systems, present opportunities for adaptation and limiting the effects of climate change with coincident benefits for health.  Food loss and waste is also an important issue on the demand side.  The report found that between 25% and 30% of total food produced globally is lost or wasted.  Reducing food loss and waste presents significant opportunities to improve food security and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p> The report also found that some of the response options and their deployment could be a cause of concern.  This is specifically related to the deployment of bioenergy and forestry.  This needs to be done carefully to avoid negative effects on food security and biodiversity.  These measures work best when they are integrated into diverse production systems and located on suitable land.  In the interests of time, I will conclude at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eamon Haughey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present Teagasc&rsquo;s views on climate change and land use.  I apologise for the absence of my colleagues.  They would like to have been here but were unable to attend owing to a clash with the policy debate on the agrifood strategy to 2030 in the Aviva Stadium.<\/p> <p>  Ireland can grow high yields of a wide range of crop species, including grass.  The Teagasc sustainability report shows that mainly tillage farms have much lower CO2 equivalent emissions per hectare than livestock systems.  Based on these types of reports, it is often suggested that ruminant-based agriculture should be reduced.  While there is scope to increase tillage and horticultural crop production in Ireland, where profitable, these are not particularly land hungry systems and would not displace much land from grassland-based agriculture.  It is also worth noting that Irish mineral soils are estimated to contain approximately 1,800 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is roughly equal to 30 years of our total national CO2 emissions or 90 years of our agricultural emissions.  A huge amount of carbon is stored in our soil.  Cultivation of long-term permanent pasture can result in large emissions of CO2 from this stored carbon.  It is not a simple matter of converting from pasture-based farming to crop production.  Ongoing research is investigating the optimisation of land use for multiple agronomic and environmental benefits.<\/p> <p>  A large number of factors need to be considered when considering optimum land use.  Not only the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, but the implications for biodiversity, water quality and economics, need to be considered.  An example of these conflicts comes to the fore when considering forestry.  Commercial conifer plantations offer the greatest economic return for the landowner and the highest levels of carbon sequestration, which is related to the growth rate of the trees, but greater biodiversity might be achieved by leaving the land in unimproved grassland or planting mixed native broadleaved forests.<\/p> <p>  As the chief inspector will outline, in addition to large-scale changes in land use, there is significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing farming systems through changing practices.  These are identified in the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, which quantifies the potential scale of impact changing a given practice can have and the cost per unit of CO2 equivalent reduction.  Two of the practices which can have a relatively quick impact at large scale and reasonable costs are increasing the amount of slurry applied using low emissions slurry spreading, which involves the use of a trailing shoe or hose, and increasing the proportion of nitrogen fertiliser applied as protected urea, which has the additional advantage of reducing ammonia emissions.  These and the other measures included in the Teagasc MACC are being promoted by Teagasc advisers as part of a new climate change campaign and are being demonstrated in the new climate change demonstration farm initiative, which we are starting next year.  The objective of this promotion is to achieve rapid uptake of these measures.  In addition to this enhanced advisory activity, Teagasc has expanded its research programme relating to greenhouse gas emissions.  Ongoing research is focused on identifying and validating new actions to reduce emissions or improve carbon sequestration such as reducing ruminant methane emissions, ensuring feedstocks meet sustainability standards for anaerobic digestion and increasing carbon sequestration in soils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spink"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address members and to highlight the ongoing work on climate action in the agrifood sector.  The Department welcomes the special report on land published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, on 8 August last.  This report confirms that our strategies to reduce emissions from our agrifood sector are on the correct path.<\/p><p>This is the second in a series of special reports to be produced by the IPCC in the sixth assessment cycle, following last year's release of the special report on global warming of 1.5&deg;C, which adds detailed information on land-related issues, and a third report entitled, The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which was published on 25 September 2019.  This report highlights that the global food system contributes to between 21% and 37% of human generated greenhouse gas emissions, while the land biosphere acts as a sink for 30% of human generated CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions through vegetation and soil.  The problem is that this land sink is vulnerable to climate change impacts, as well as other environmental and human pressures.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the report stressed that food production systems are increasingly vulnerable to climate change.  Risks related to food security are greatest in pathways with lower incomes, increased food demand and increased food prices resulting from competition for land, which generates more limited trade and other adaptation challenges.  The special report on climate change and land enforces the call for urgent adoption of mitigation and adaptation actions globally, including sustainable land-related strategies.  The report demonstrates the impacts, vulnerabilities and risks of further global warming to our societies and natural systems.  It also highlights that balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods, such as coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food which is produced in resilient, sustainable and low greenhouse gas emission systems, present major opportunities for adaptation and mitigation, while generating significant co-benefits for human health.  The message that food production is causing major global environmental risks is clear.  Sustainable food production should use no additional land, safeguard biodiversity, protect water quality, reduce fertiliser pollutants, produce zero carbon dioxide emissions and cause no further increases in methane and nitrous oxide emissions.<br\/><br\/>Climate change is impacting food security all over the world, as food systems are already coming under different pressures and it also has adverse effects on associated populations.  We have seen this in Ireland as recent weather extremes highlighted our own food system&rsquo;s vulnerabilities.  The IPCC's conclusion poses a major challenge for the sector but it is simultaneously an opportunity for the Irish agrifood sector, as our production system is recognised by international independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon footprints in the European Union.  The Food and Agricultural Organization, FAO, has recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland-based production systems.  Evidence of this is further reflected in the EU Joint Research Centre report of 2010, which illustrates that while intensive dairy systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change.  This report found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer per unit of dairy production in the EU, and is the fifth most carbon efficient producer of beef per kilogram.  We are therefore in a good starting place due to our highly efficient farmers, coupled with a well developed research and advisory capacity and global recognition of our Origin Green objectives.  However, it is clear that we need to do more to address these significant challenges.  That requirement is not only regulatory but is also demanded by the market.  The consumer of tomorrow is clearly asking for verifiable sustainability credentials.<br\/><br\/>The all-of-Government climate action plan was published this June and set out over 180 actions to meet Ireland&rsquo;s EU targets for 2030, namely, a 30% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions based on 2005 levels.  This plan has set an agricultural sector target to reduce emissions from 20.2 Mt in 2017 to between 17.5 Mt and 19 Mt by 2030, which is a reduction of between 10% and 15%.  Furthermore, this plan requires the sector to enhance CO<sub>2<\/sub>removals from the landscape by at least 26.8 Mt CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent, while also contributing to the development of sustainable decarbonised energy systems.  The combination of both these commitments sets our ambitions in line with the carbon footprint of the sector.  This will require full implementation of the actions set out in the Teagasc report, also known as the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, coupled with increased afforestation and the appropriate management of a significant area of farmed peatland.  These actions are ambitious and challenging for the sector and require early and extensive adoption of mitigation measures, particularly focusing on nitrogen use efficiency and animal breeding technologies.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will shortly launch a roadmap consultation process on how the sector will transition and achieve its CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent reduction targets over the next decade.<br\/><br\/>The IPPC report outlines that an overall focus on sustainability, coupled with early action, offers the best chance of tackling climate change.  This underlines the importance of the climate action plan and Ireland&rsquo;s next agrifood strategy to 2030.  As we speak, the Department is conducting a public engagement with more than 400 attendees on developing its next strategy to 2030.  Economically viable and sustainable production is at the heart of this process.  This strategy will be instrumental in providing a framework for the sustainable growth of the sector.  As with all strategic plans, it must evolve and respond to rapidly changing circumstances.  In addition, the Department has commenced the process of developing its strategic plan for the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and climate delivery will be a key component of this.  However, the CAP and strengthened regulation will not be enough.  Industry will need to step up and collaborate to drive innovation and adoption of best practice to ensure the agriculture sector plays its part.  We have already commenced this journey with the nitrates derogation review of 2019, which recommended tighter measures aimed at further strengthening the protection of water and attaining optimum soil fertility that are consistent with efficient agricultural production, effective water and air quality and delivery of our climate ambitions.  The greater focus on improving nitrogen use efficiencies on intensive farms will provide additional environmental protection.<br\/><br\/>While acknowledging that the agriculture sector produces emissions, the sector should also be seen as part of the solution to our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society.  Considerable opportunities exist within the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors to address climate change while providing many co-benefits to society.  Unlike other sectors, no one-off technological fixes can be applied.  Mitigation requires the sustained application of improved management practices by farmers over time.  Some land use mitigation responses, such as the conservation of peatlands, wetlands and forestry, have relatively immediate impacts.  Others, such as afforestation and restoration of high carbon soils, will take longer to deliver.<br\/><br\/>As part of a special allocation of &euro;3 million in the recent budget to fund additional pilot projects aimed specifically at climate measures in agriculture, a call for a new pilot European innovation partnership project on reduced management of farmed peatlands will be announced in due course.  This is designed to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to meeting our commitments as part of the Government's climate action plan.  It will also enhance the protection of biodiversity and water quality and provide a template for action in advance of Ireland's next Common Agricultural Policy.<br\/><br\/>The latest research from Teagasc identified significant additional abatement potential for the sector.  Agriculture can potentially make major contributions to meeting renewable energy targets, although this mitigation effort comes at a cost.  If we are to achieve these ambitions for the sector, it is important to continue to incentivise positive action through our afforestation programme and a well funded and appropriately configured Common Agricultural Policy.  We have already been doing much with the current Common Agricultural Policy by supporting farmers to deliver environmental dividends through agri-environment schemes.  We are operating several schemes to ensure the sustainable use of land, the maintenance of natural resources and the limiting of climate change.  We have provided a number of statistics on that which I do not need to repeat.<br\/><br\/>Ireland welcomes the proposal that 40% of the CAP budget post 2020 will contribute to climate action.  This approach aligns well with the advice of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, which recommended that farmers be rewarded for good environmental practices.  These provisions will enable us to continue on our path towards carbon neutrality by promoting sustainable intensification of food production and maintaining a vibrant rural economy.  This will require collaborative action.  There are also challenges regarding food waste, as the EU requires us to reduce food waste<i><\/i>by 50% <i>per capita<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It is important to remember that Irish agricultural production is recognised by international independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon footprints.  The efficiency of Ireland&rsquo;s temperate grassland-based production systems is also recognised.  We will continue to work at building consensus around the need for the agriculture sector to make a positive contribution to climate action.  This is about getting better, not just bigger, and focusing on productivity and efficiencies rather than numbers.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine fully agrees with the finding of the special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, that land is under growing human pressure.

Interestingly, the authors looked at the food system as a whole, including both the demand and the supply side.  Previously a lot of efficiency work took place on the production side, which is very efficient here in Ireland.  There was less work on the demand side.  The message from the IPCC was very clearly and carefully worded.  It suggests moving towards a plant-based diet, but its suggestions include animal products produced with low levels of greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable and resilient systems.  The report definitely does not state that one should not eat meat.  The IPCC provides advice.  It does not tell people or governments what to do.  There is certainly a place for meat consumption.  However if one was to change one's diet to reduce its carbon footprint, reducing consumption of animal-sourced protein would have the biggest effect.  That is what the report found.<\/p> <p>  If we continue to consume meat, the best thing we can do is ensure it comes from a system with a low greenhouse gas footprint such as a grassland-based system.  Systems with low external inputs tend to be the most efficient.  Our grazing system is efficient because the animals are at pasture for most of the year.  Inputs from external sources, such as protein, are low in comparison with systems where the feed is grown somewhere else and then brought to the animals indoors.  In that regard we are in a good position but there is no doubt that if dietary change is to make a contribution globally, consumption of animal-sourced foods must decrease.  This is difficult for Ireland but we are in a good starting position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eamon Haughey"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Haughey.

At the moment the process is at a very consultative stage.  The Minister has set up a consultative committee which includes other Departments, various stakeholders etc. to inform the development of our strategic plan.  At the same time we are holding several public meetings.  I cannot pre-empt what will come from them.  The best way I can articulate the evolution that is taking place is to refer to the agri-environment schemes of several years ago, such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  That scheme pertained to the whole farm but the actions represented a light touch.  The next iteration of the rural development programme included the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which encouraged farmers to take the right actions in a more detailed way.  The current iteration of GLAS concerns taking the right actions in the right locations.  We are using resources like the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, map of high-status water quality as a selection tool to prioritising entry to the scheme.  We then make prescriptions for water quality in those specific areas.  All I can say about the process is that CAP expenditure is increasingly targeted and focused.  That will naturally evolve in the next round.<\/p> <p>  Under the most recent iteration of GLAS we have helped to plant more than 1,200 km of new hedges.  Some 4,500 farmers have been supported in using low-emission slurry equipment.  We have supported 270,000 ha of low-input permanent pasture.  This is the type of action that is conducive to the delivery of carbon ambitions.  We will have to grow and develop on these gains.  About 2,500 farmers have applied for structural funding grants to purchase low-emission equipment.  That is also indicative of our support for farmers implementing the actions within the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC.  <\/p> <p>  At the same time we have carried out a review of derogation farmers.  Those are the more intensive farmers and represent a sector which has grown in size.  We went through a public consultation to ask what more they could contribute.  One of the measures that has come out of that is earlier use of trailing shoe technology as a mandatory requirement for those farmers.  From April 2020 about a third of the slurry in the country will be applied using trailing shoe technology, which is a major advance towards our objectives concerning both ammonia and climate change. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The cost of the required equipment often presents an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P00600","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Are there solutions for farmers who cannot afford this, such as leasing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P00800","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>We will strike a reasonable balance between the regulatory requirements on more intensive farmers and incentivising less intensive farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I invite the witnesses to pick up on the final point made by Mr. Callanan concerning the trailing shoe.

From a water quality point of view it is totally contradictory that farmers have to farm by calendar and are forced to have the slurry out by Tuesday on saturated ground when spreading slurry during a dry spell, by trailing shoe or a splash plate, will not cause nearly as much environmental damage.

From the agricultural catchments programme, which we have supported and Teagasc has implemented over many years, the evidence is quite clear that the greatest loss of nutrient occurs with the application of slurry over the winter period.<\/p><p>To put it in context, before the nitrates regulations, and I have been there from the beginning, less than 5% of slurries were spread at that time of the year.  We seem to be fixated on that, although it is a relatively modest volume.<\/p><p> Second, in terms of fertiliser value, a typical four-bay double-sided shed, which every farmer would understand, has about &euro;1,000 worth of fertiliser.  The inherent difficulty with applications towards the back end is that one has to ask whether somebody would go out and buy &euro;1,000 worth of fertiliser and spread it on this day of the year, and the answer is generally \"No\".  We have brought up this issue of calendar farming and we discussed it with the Commission at one stage in regard to the question of flexibility.  The Commission was quite clear in its direction to us that if one wants to consider flexibility, one has to recognise it cuts both ways, and that could result in the increasing of the closed period instead of decreasing it, if that is what people want.  That requires more concrete action.  Basically, people have to increase their storage requirement if that is the approach they want to take. <\/p><p> I would caution farmers in general.  When we explained to them the reality of the closed period and seeking flexibility, and how it is going to increase if the weather conditions are not right, which would mean farmers have to construct additional storage to cover that, it becomes a more focused conversation.<\/p><p> We structurally changed the system to allow dairy farmers to spread soiled water during winter and to dilute it.  However, we still seem to have a problem where farmers are not using as much slurry as they can in the springtime and the summer, which is more ideal than autumn spreading, because, when the growth is not there, they are not getting a return on the fertiliser.  The evidence is clear that the spreading of slurry during the winter months leads to higher nutrient loss.  I must also confirm that the nitrates regulations are under the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, although we give a lot of assistance. <\/p><p> We must also reflect on the fact that our nutrient load has been increasing.  Our fertiliser usage in the past three years has been growing and, at the same time, our water quality has been diminishing.  We are about 3% down in terms of water quality over the last reporting period and while we do not have data for the most recent couple of years, we do not expect that this trend has been reversed.  People have to reflect on that.  While I appreciate fully that it is a frustration for farmers, we have to recognise that, within our climate change objectives, we see slurry as a fertiliser best used with the likes of trailing shoe technology and at the most appropriate time of year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#P01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Nutrient value aside, it was water quality that I was coming at.

There is Bord Bia's Food Dudes programme, which encourages good practice among kids in respect of food.  The Senator raises a very important point about the discussion surrounding agriculture and climate.  The European Council conclusions as well as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report recognise the inherent challenge in our having to balance the demands on agriculture with the necessity of food production.  The Council conclusions recognise that these are intrinsically linked.  So does our national policy, which is an approach to carbon neutrality that does not negatively impact food production.  We have a responsibility in this regard, as Senator Daly said.  The figure we work off is the requirement to increase investment in agriculture for food by at least 60% by 2050.  We must contribute to that environment but must equally contribute to the national ambitions.  That is why the balance between reducing our own footprint and committing to carbon removal through sequestration, be it afforestation or management of peatlands, etc., is critical.  This is the reason for the &euro;3 million that has been assigned to the Department to carry out pilot projects in respect of carbon removal, which will include at its forefront peatland management measures.  These projects are critical to striking the balance between food and carbon removal and delivering on both objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Muldowney"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>We will have to move on.

I have a question about the IPCC and the awful scenes we saw of the forest fires in the Amazon and the horrendous damage being done there.  That can be contrasted with the significant efforts we are now making here to tackle climate change.  I think there has been broad acceptance in recent years that the climate is changing.  We had a very big problem previously with climate deniers.  How do the witnesses perceive a global effort being made?  Is it possible?  As I said, contrasting our little country of 6 million people with what is happening in the Amazon, people rightfully ask, no matter what we do, whether it will make a difference.  While we know we need to make an effort, it is very challenging to get that message out to people.<\/p> <p>  Has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made any progress on an anaerobic digestion strategy?  We hear that it is the way to go and will be a good solution for farmers - some anyway - yet we have heard some negative feedback from certain areas.  Will the Department brief us on any progress that might be made on this?  Has the Department made any progress on a response to the IPCC special report on climate change and land?<\/p> <p>  Has Teagasc carried out any research on the use of rewetted peatlands?  We mentioned paludiculture, which - the Teagasc representatives do not need me to tell them this - is the productive use of wetlands in the growing of plants of one sort or another, particularly for biomass.  Do they have anything to say on that?<\/p> <p>  My other question for Teagasc concerns the tree planting targets.  I think I read somewhere that we will have to plant 250 million trees.  If we are to try to achieve that, how will we convince members of the farming community, who take pride in their land, especially if they have very good land, arable land, to plant trees?  That is an awful lot of trees across our small landmass, bearing in mind that 20% of it is peatland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#R00400","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I will start with the question about anaerobic digestion, AD.  As far as progress on it is concerned, we have committed to supporting the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on AD because that Department is the main driver on it.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine sees it as inherently valuable to the overall contribution.  We must recognise where it might fit in, which would be particularly around biomethane because the transport fuel alternatives are quite limited.<\/p> <p>  Let us be honest.  There are political decisions to be made as to how to manage the cost differential.  I discussed this recently with Gas Networks Ireland, representatives of which were before the Joint Committee on Climate Action and Environment yesterday.  I spoke to Denis O'Sullivan quite recently about this and met Ervia to discuss it as well.  Somebody will have to resolve the issue of pricing and how this is supported.  The current gas price is approximately 2.5 cent per kilowatt hour, whereas biogas is 8.5 cent and biomethane is approximately 11 cent.  That is quite a substantial differential that has to be filled.  How that is done is a matter for another Department, but this Department sees that there are viable uses of animal manures and for a certain amount of grass into that system.  From our perspective, however, we must resolve the issue of compliance with the sustainability criteria.  Then one must get good yields with very little nitrogen input.  These are just the rule requirements.  I think Teagasc has commenced a project on how this can be achieved.  It has also set up a small biogas plant in Grange to investigate this.

There are a few points to be made.  I will roll back a wee bit to the 1.5&deg;C report that came out last year.  It set the scene for the urgency required and the transformation we need of global energy and land systems.  To put this in context, the report considered what the land sector could contribute globally.  As for limiting warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, we need an increase in forestation of 3.4 million sq. km.  That is more than the size of India.  That gives just an idea of the transformative action we need by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels.  That is just to put it in context with forestry.  It is important.<\/p> <p>  What we have seen in the Amazon is very shocking and sad and is obviously undoing much of the good work being done globally.  It also highlights one of the dangers associated with both increased levels of warming and the limitations of natural solutions.  As the temperature increases, this assessment shows that risk of wildfires, for example, will increase.  If we go to 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, the risk will increase.  If we go to 3&deg;C, it will increase even more.  Those carbon stores in forests will then be more vulnerable.  The other side of it is management.  One can store carbon in forests, but that is potentially vulnerable to future mismanagement, so there is always that risk that the good work can be undone.<\/p> <p>  Bringing it back to Ireland, there is another question over the level of afforestation.  I will not go into that as it is not my area, but it is worth noting that we have a massive amount of carbon stored in our peatlands.  In a way, they are our equivalent of the Amazon rainforests.  That is a crude comparison but it is one that can be made.  How we manage this is something we can act on now in the context of conservation and possibly restoration of some of those lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eamon Haughey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Regarding the engagement with the IPCC special report, it is important to recognise that Ireland was pivotal to having the report done.

In terms of encouraging landowners and farmers in particular to plant, the Department has been especially active in the area of promotion.

There is a point in what he is saying which is understood.  The problem arises when we have a wet autumn like this one and cattle are moved off the land a lot earlier.  This year there is late grass but ground conditions are getting very bad.  We could have a different type of autumn where it is colder with less grass but is still very wet.  The cattle are going in early.  We have seen it happen over the Christmas period or the period directly after Christmas that there is a dry spell and then, lo and behold, come the middle of January when it is time to go and spread, there are downpours again.  That is the problem.  It is not an easy one.  Mr. Callanan referred to capacity, and I understand that, but it is very hard in terms of management for some farmers to work that.  If cattle are brought in quickly and they are standing on slatted units, if they are there earlier than expected, we get to January, the date comes for spreading and better days may have passed in the week or two previous to that.  I just want to raise that point.<\/p> <p>  I would also like the Department officials to deal with the issue of the derogation on pig slurry.  My recollection is that we sought an extension of the derogation on spreading pig slurry about a year ago.  I am open to correction on all of this.  Where stands that?  The number of units in the country has dropped but the units have got bigger.  There is a particular problem with how we manage the slurry from those units.  The IFA and others were worried about it a year or two ago and there was a derogation sought at that point.  How can that be moved to a more sustainable basis?<\/p> <p>  My other question for the Department is about forestry.  I am pleased to hear Mr. Coggins talk about farming and forestry.  That has been a big bone of contention.  I represent Laois-Offaly.  In the Slieve Blooms there has been concern about forestry replacing farming.  There is a particular problem in Leitrim, as I know from my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny.  Driving around Leitrim, we can see it happening, particularly with the widespread monocultural plantations of spruce.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the coming Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reforms and the new CAP programme, is the Department developing proposals around having sustainable hedgerows such that farmers are rewarded for maintaining bulky, high hedgerows?  They are one of the great sources of habitat and are very important for drainage and shelter.  The people who planted them understood this hundreds of years ago but somewhere along the line the human race got so clever that we decided that what those people thought did not matter and we should just get the hedgerows out of the way.  Teagasc advisers at one stage - I am not particularly having a go at Mr. Spink here - were saying to people to push them out of the way, and we closed up drains and moved those natural barriers out of the way.  We took away habitats.  Now we have to use more chemicals to spray the crops because there are no habitats to keep the little fellows happy, to keep the insects that are attacking crops under control.  Is there a move in the Department to come up with specific proposals regarding sustainable hedgerows?  I know there is a programme for planting more hedgerows, which is good.<\/p> <p>  I want to bring this to the officials' attention because I say this to the county councils the whole time.  The county councils are allowing widespread destruction of hedgerows.  In the conditions of planning permission for building a house, I cannot see why we do not require people to maintain the hedgerow in front of their house.  Many people like showing off, so they want to bulldoze the hedgerows, or ditches as we call them down our way, out of the way and put up a bloody wooden palisade fence so everybody can see their house.  We should be doing more to try to protect the hedgerows.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to Teagasc.<\/p><p>Some would say that the ship has sailed on beet production.  I am not a soil expert but the witnesses are.  Sugar beet was grown extensively in my part of the world.  When sugar beet was being grown, whatever crop was sowed on the same land after sugar beet there was a great yield the following year.  Sugar beet was a great rotation crop and it provided ground cover for six months of the year.  I have often seen beet harvested right up to Christmas so the fields were covered for six months and, therefore, the crop has great potential for sequestration.  Beet Ireland is a group that tried to regenerate interest in beet production but it has postponed such plans.  Has research into beet production ceased?  Has beet production been completely forgotten about?  I firmly believe that soil quality and the environment are poorer without beet production.  Also, farmers are poorer because beet production generated a handy cash crop, particularly after Christmas when there was not much else.  Beet tops were also fed to cattle.  We did not need as many slatted sheds because one could allow cattle and sheep to graze on the beet tops that remained after beet was harvested.  <\/p><p> I have read reports that this country imports 90% of its vegetables.  I know we cannot grow avocados.  I would love if we could grow avocados, grapes and a whole lot of other varieties but we can grow a lot of vegetables.  I have not got a sense from mainstream farming and the farming bodies that there is a great desire or shift in mindset.  The carbon miles on what we eat in this country are unnecessary.  Some people in vegetable production have said that we can grow 75% of our imports of fruit and vegetables.  I ask the delegation to deal with that issue also.<\/p><p> I have one last question for Teagasc.  Mr. Spink said in his statement that \"commercial conifer plantations offer the greatest economic return for the landowner and the highest levels of carbon sequestration, which is related to the growth rate\".  He means that conifers grow very quickly so there is carbon sequestration.  I contend that the practice clears the forest floor, kills all known germs and everything underneath, including animals, plant life and everything else.  The practice also causes pollution in terms of water quality.  Should we not move from monoculture conifer plantations to more sustainable forestry and put a premium on varieties that carry over from one generation to the next?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#S00600","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned hedgerows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spink"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#T00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>The Deputy directed his question on hedgerows to the Department officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spink"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#T00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Teagasc has organised a hedgerow week that will be launched next Monday at the Teagasc college in Kildalton.

We do not currently do any research on sugar beet.  We did a small amount of work when Beet Ireland developed its plans.  Part of our work was on how much the yield potential of new beet varieties had increased since sugar beet was last grown here.  The work was part-funded by the Irish Farmers Association.  Our work showed that there had been an increase in the yield potential of beet since the industry closed.  At present we do not have a programme because there is no market.  As far as I am aware, Beet Ireland has shelved its plans.  However, we recognise the value of beet production in crop rotation and the value of break crops in crop rotation.  For the last few years, we have conducted a large programme on break crops and analysed the benefit of beans and oilseed rape in animal feed.  Initially, the research was funded by the IFA and we have recruited a permanent researcher to work in that area.  We recognise the value of crop rotation and how non-cereal crops greatly benefit cereal crops.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about horticulture and he is right.  As I have mentioned, there is scope to significantly increase our horticultural production.  It is not a particularly land hungry enterprise and, therefore, it will not replace the thousands of acres of grassland currently used for livestock production.  There is potential to significantly increase our production if it is found to be economically viable to do so.<\/p> <p>  There was another issue and it is not an area in which I am expert.  The Deputy mentioned avocados.  Members of the public are no longer used to eating seasonal vegetables.  People want to eat avocados on Christmas Day as well as in the middle of the summer.  Our domestic production is seasonal so we will not necessarily be able to replace everything that we import.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a final point about forestry, which I might start to reply to but my colleague, Mr. Coggins, might finish answering.  The Deputy made a few points about conifers and their impact on water quality.  At present we are harvesting forests that were planted between 25 and 30 years ago.  The rules and regulations for forestry have dramatically changed in the intervening period.  One now needs 30% of broadleaves when establishing a new forest and there are setbacks from rivers, houses and things.  One might have forests there now that are planted right up to the edge of a stream and are being harvested, which is causing pollution problems.  That is no longer the case and Mr. Coggins might have more detail on the matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spink"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>When people consider mature forests they do not look great from a biodiversity point of view.

There are certain setbacks from watercourses that have been set down in an environmental requirements document that was launched a number of years ago.

The highest grants and premiums that the Department pays are for the retention of broadleaf plantations and in the recent mid-term review we increased those rates.

The Commission has been very clear that if we continue to give derogations and flexibility in terms of the closed period it will think that we have a problem with storage capacity.  People must recognise that.  Deputy Stanley's constituency has 16 weeks storage but all adjoining countries have substantially higher storage capacity.  A challenge for is the balance of being honest with farmers by saying, yes, it might suit a small number to be flexible on the practice but it will come at a cost to a vast majority of farmers if we continually move towards granting that.  I appreciate what was said about the January window.  Often people say that the weather was great and it is dry, the ground is frosty and they could have gone out.  There are two conditions if one wants to treat slurry as a fertiliser.  Yes, one must have ground conditions that suit the application of slurry.   Equally, one must have growth conditions that suit its uptake.  Certainly one does not get the growth in January to take up the nutrient if it is applied.<\/p><p>That is not in keeping with what is clearly set down in the overall policy, which is slurry as a fertiliser-nutrient, not a waste, and to apply it at best timing.  Those are the messages we are giving farmers.  <\/p><p> On the derogation for pig farmers, the nitrates directive introduced in 2006 provided that the land area requirements for the spreading of the slurries that were already there would have to be quadrupled because people were spreading at a higher level than crop uptake was allowing for.  While it was not exactly a derogation, a concession was granted for pig slurry which diluted the phosphorus content.  A doubling of the spread lands required was allowed for.  We negotiated around 2008 or 2010 a ten-year glide path to full compliance with nutrient loading.  That period has now elapsed.  The pig sector is now complying fully with the requirement that the application of nutrients in slurries be absolutely appropriate to the crop need that it is being applied to.  That issue has been largely dealt with in regard to compliance.<\/p><p> On the sugar beet industry, I agree that sugar beet was a very valuable break crop but particular challenges arose with it, especially with regard to the price of sugar.  The same situation arises at the moment.  The programme for Government includes a commitment by State agencies to look at viable submissions on the re-emergence of a sugar beet industry.  As Mr. Spink has said, no such proposal has come forward.  One can see the logic in that as sugar prices are poor and the application of sugar taxes has reduced demand for sugar.  While yields here had improved, they would not be equivalent to the yields that can be achieved in continental sugar beet production or sugar cane production.  From our perspective, we have not had a viable proposal put before us on it.<\/p><p> On horticulture, the Deputy is entirely correct, we are not best suited to certain agricultural production, for example, avocados, pineapples and bananas.  However, there is a significant amount of field vegetables that could be displaced.  We have a well funded &euro;6 million annual investment in the horticultural industry.  We also have the producer organisation, PO, which aggregates multiple producers to give them clout when dealing with supermarket purchasers.  We have a very strong history in that regard on the mushroom side where we have had a strong PO for some years.  We have constructively engaged with industry, through the horticultural industry forum, to try to encourage greater use of producer organisations which, as in the case of beef, bring growers together.  We are comfortable that this engagement is having some success.  People are willing to engage with the process because they can draw down additional support at EU level through producer organisations.  This can be used for marketing, professionalising supply and achieving the scale that is necessary to deal with the supermarkets on an equal rather than a small supplier footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Callanan for his answers.

I will group my questions and then ask one follow-up question on a different issue.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Haughey will respond on the nitrates issue as we have heard mainly from the Department.  In the IPCC report, one of the most significant changes in land use in the past 50 years has been the 800% increase in the use of nitrates.  I understand the graph had to be amended to show this.  I ask Dr. Haughey to explain how urgent it is to address that issue at global level.  This is a huge outlier and one of the major interventions.  The increase in the use of nitrates has been more than four times higher than increases or changes in any other single area.  I will not ask Mr Callanan to outline again the various ameliorating measures.  Is there a timeline or pathway for Ireland moving away from seeking a derogation from aspects of the nitrates regulation?  We are negotiating derogations from various measures.  Mr. Callanan mentioned that we had a ten-year derogation in the area of pig slurry which has expired.  In general, what is the timeline for moving away from our position of seeking derogations from the nitrates directive?<\/p> <p>  Peatlands have been identified as one of the core means by which we can store carbon.  I will not delve into the regressive step of de-designating natural heritage areas, which is being debated in the Seanad.  Are there plans to restore some of the peatlands that are not in natural heritage areas and that have been drained for agricultural or forestry use?  If so, what is the scale of such restoration to the peatland and carbon sequestration function?  Rewetting might also be an issue for Teagasc to address, including the question of how rewetting projects can be accelerated.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that has been brought to my attention, which was touched on in relation to forestry, is the link between the ecological and climate functions.  How do we link those functions?  I would like to see more of this in the IPCC report.  We have heard, for example, that beekeeping could have an increased role in rewetting.  Section B4.3 of the IPCC report refers to the importance of natural vegetation restoration, in which pollinators, of course, have a key role.  How do the national pollinator plan and pollination feature in the plans we are hearing about regarding land use?  Pollination is crucial in the restoration of natural vegetation and in ecosystems and forests but is also crucial in horticulture, which has been mentioned.  On a global and national level how are we prioritising actions around the pollinator pathway and their intersection?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley mentioned very eloquently the quality of hedgerows, not simply awareness of them.  Hedgerows are key pollinator pathways across the Irish landscape.  They are very important in that function.<\/p> <p>  I thought 12 km is a small amount-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#U00700","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>It is 1,200 km.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I was surprised when I heard that figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#U00900","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>My apologies for my mistake.

There are a few reasons for this massive global increase.  The use of nitrogen began from a very low base, particularly in the developing world.  It has increased most dramatically in Asia over the period.  It is clear that there are issues with water quality.  We talk a lot about sustainable intensification.  This report sets out some statements on limits to intensification when it becomes unsustainable.  When water quality is reduced and it is obvious that there are inefficiencies in the system, I would say the use of that fertiliser is no longer sustainable.  A related finding is that there has been an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture globally over the same period.  That is linked to the increase in ruminant agriculture and fertiliser inputs.  There are several things that can be done here in Ireland.  Teagasc is doing a great deal of work on the need for an uptake in the use of clovers in grassland swards.  It is an active research area.  Clover can reduce the amount of nitrogen that is needed because it fixes it naturally from the atmosphere.  It is a win-win.  The protein content of clover is higher than that of grass, which makes it another win.  The protein sufficiency of farms can be increased in this way.  I mention that in response to the point that was made about the land area required for feed.<\/p> <p>  I will explain why biodiversity was not covered in the special report on land.  Part of the reason is that another report from the UN - the IPBES report on biodiversity - was published earlier this year.  Biodiversity was not dealt with as a main issue in the special report, which focused on climate.  The Government did not ask for biodiversity to be a main chapter in the special report.  One of the outcomes of the special report is the recommendation that we need to act by using integrated response options which consider many challenges at once.  It is not necessarily the best idea to focus solely on targeting mitigation, for example.  Some of the high nature value grasslands we have in Ireland, particularly in the north and the west, where there are less productive soils, might not be the best place to put forestry because that would have a really negative impact on biodiversity.  Regional specificity is certainly an important part of that kind of thing as well.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to food waste and horticulture.  Agricultural diversification is identified in this report as one of the response options.  I am looking at a table that is referred to as figure SPM.3.  Agricultural diversification is positive across mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security.  Ireland has one of the lowest rates of vegetable and horticultural production in Europe.  If we could improve that, it would be beneficial for farmers' incomes.  Having a more diverse income stream can buffer against the food price shocks we associate with dips in the price of milk or beef.  It could be of benefit to have another income stream.  Potentially, there is a lot that could be done with regard to diversification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eamon Haughey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I will speak about the link between biodiversity and climate and the pollinator plan.  The Department supports the planting of native woodlands through its afforestation scheme.  I will refer to the number of trees as a metric.  At the beginning of the forestry programme, we planted approximately 350,000 native trees.  In 2018, that increased to just over 1 million native trees.  So far this year, we are on target to exceed last year's target in terms of native woodlands.<\/p> <p>  On the pollinator plan, I remind the committee that native woodlands create very valuable habitats for pollinators.  On World Bee Day earlier this year, the Department wrote to the owners of native woodlands to invite them to contact the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations and the Irish Beekeepers Association with a view to establishing hives in those woodlands, which we helped them to establish.  The Department has done many things to help to increase native woodland cover.  The increase in rates in the mid-term review was mentioned earlier.  The Department recently announced the name of the first business that will contribute to the establishment of native woodlands under the Department's new woodland environmental fund.

They are supported by the actions taken in schemes like the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme.  Things like bee habitats and wild bird cover are tremendously positive for the likes of pollinators.  This is what we mean by co-benefits.  Our campus in Backweston was managed in a pollinator-friendly way this year.  Large areas of the campus were not cut.  We are very keen to support pollinators.  We introduced bees to the roof of Agriculture House earlier this year.  A number of locations in central Dublin are now used for beekeeping.<br\/><br\/>Reference has been made to grant aid schemes.  Under the horticulture aid scheme, support is given to the Irish Beekeepers Association for physical infrastructure.  We also provide a service with regard to diseases in bees, etc.  This is being implemented through the Backweston campus as a further service to the industry.<br\/><br\/>We were also asked about derogations, etc.  The demand for flexibility during the closed period is an issue that we have discussed.  Dr. Haughey has articulated the reasons we are so keen to proceed in this regard.  The most attractive way to reduce the use of nitrogen fertiliser is to use slurries in a better way.  That is driving our thinking.  I would be wrong to suggest that we are lax in our implementation of the nitrates directive.  There is a role for housing in this regard.  The whole-territory approach taken in Ireland is not common everywhere.  Ireland is one of just seven or eight countries that include phosphorous, as well as nitrogen, in the implementation of the nitrates directive.  The impact of phosphorous on water quality is as big as that of nitrogen.  Overall, we are taking a strong approach to the implementation of the directive.  We avail of a derogation by allowing some more intensive farming to take place.  That comes at an additional cost to the farmers in question, who are required to take additional measures.  There is a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>in this case.  Generally speaking, pasture land does not tend to be a leaky as other types of farming land.  This has an impact on the risks associated with it.  We must comply with certain conditions that apply when a derogation is being applied for.  We take a strong approach in this area.<br\/><br\/>On the quality of hedges, I should point out that hedge cutting is not controlled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As I have pointed out previously, the issue is the timing of hedge cutting rather than its impact on the carbon content.  There is ongoing work in this area.  I have cautioned people in this respect on a few occasions.  Hedgerows are a big sink in terms of carbon emissions and sequestered carbon.  They account for approximately 6% of the landscape.  We see them as important.  The only thing that is of value, in terms of credit, is the additionality.  Work is ongoing with regard to the change of management and understanding the carbon content.  Rather than using hedgerows as a get-out-of-jail card by saying we have a significant number of them, we need to focus on the extent to which additional planting is different from what was being done in 2005.  No additional credit arises unless the area covered by hedgerows is bigger than the area covered by hedgerows in the baseline year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>The Senator has one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019101600002#V00600","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>My problem is that we do not know as much about hedgerow coverage as we used to because hedge cutting for road safety purposes is no longer reported to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Biogas has been specifically mentioned.

The figure for 2016 was 3.1%.<\/p> <p>  Breaking that down, there are two types of expenditure: low-risk expenditure and high-risk expenditure.  The low-risk expenditure is generally free from material error.  That means the error rate is below our materiality threshold of 2%.  Almost 50% of the expenditure falls into this category.  <\/p> <p>   However, the other 50%, approximately &euro;61 billion, is high-risk expenditure.  The overall estimated level of error for this type of expenditure is 4.5%.<\/p> <p>  I am responsible for cohesion, which had an error rate, in 2018, of 5%.  <\/p> <p>  To put those figures into perspective, the EU budget for 2018 was almost &euro;160 billion, to which Ireland contributed &euro;2.6 billion.  The main bulk of this budget, 66%, is based on gross national income, GNI, and traditional loan resources and VAT cover approximately another 24%.  Depending on what happens today in Luxembourg, those figures for the customs and VAT that we collect on behalf of the EU could change substantially.<\/p> <p>  The spending in 2018 totalled &euro;157 billion.  This equates roughly to &euro;300 for every EU citizen.  It is the equivalent of 2.2% of total government expenditure across the EU member states and represents 1% of gross EU national income.  That is to put the budget into context.  Expectations are sometimes very big but, in relative terms, the amounts concerned are quite small, although it is still a lot of money.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has contributed &euro;2.6 billion to the budget.  We basically received back &euro;2.064 billion, 76% of which comprises subsidies for agriculture.  The rest of that amount is mainly for competitiveness and growth.  The important part of that, in Irish terms, is the contribution we receive back for agriculture and the environment.<\/p> <p>  We had a net operating balance with the EU in 2018 of &euro;315 million.  This is the second year in a row that we have contributed more than we have received back.  It does not tie in exactly with the funds flow because an accounting adjustment is made for all member states to reflect administrative overheads.  In funds flow terms, we gave approximately &euro;550 million but, as an operating budgetary balance, which is the basis on which the net contribution is calculated by the EU Commission, the figure is &euro;315 million.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;2.06 billion is broken down into &euro;1.56 billion in sustainable growth and natural resources, of which &euro;1.2 billion is for direct payments to farmers, and the other &euro;320 million for rural development expenditure.  That is the bulk of the funding.<\/p> <p>  We have gone through what we found in terms of the audit population.  There is an important point to add about the error rates.  We are confident that, based on the statistical sample we have taken, we can stand over an average estimated error rate of 2.6%.  That 2.6% of the EU budget is &euro;4 billion, which is still quite a lot of money.  That is an error rate, so we try and emphasise that this is where the rules have not been fully complied with.  EU-related funding, and the rules relating to it, can sometimes be complex.  Depending on the nature of the expenditure and how it is dispersed, the error rates are higher, as we have seen earlier.  We will go into a little more detail, for instance about cohesion, where the projects are complicated compared to, say, direct payments for farmers, which are more conditional on a requirement - a land parcel entitles one to so much - or an Erasmus grant for a student.  Those examples are much more conditional compared to the cost reimbursement expenditure, which is where we have most of our problems.  That is what I mean by high-risk expenditure.  That is where we are talking about cost reimbursements.<\/p> <p>  I am responsible for the chapter in the annual report relating to cohesion.  The amount that was subject to audit last year was &euro;23.6 billion and there was an error rate of 5%.  The error rate was 3% in 2017 so there was a significant increase for 2018 and it is more or less back to the level it was in 2016.<\/p> <p>  We explained last year that 2017, for cohesion especially, was a very unusual year.  Little expenditure was submitted by the member states.  The equivalent of the &euro;23.6 billion for 2018 was approximately &euro;8 billion in 2017.  There has been a considerable increase in the expenditure for cohesion that was claimed by member states.<\/p> <p>  By its nature, this tends to be very complex.  It includes large infrastructure projects that involve difficult and complicated public procurement procedures.  We have issues with state aid and all sorts of other things that are not applicable in our low-risk expenditure.<\/p> <p>  We try and rely as much as we can on the work of the EU Commission and the other authorities in the member states that work on behalf of the Commission.  We cannot fully rely on these figures.  When we have gone back to recheck transactions that have been audited, we have found additional errors that were not originally detected either by the other authority or the Commission and we think the error rate that they have calculated is understated.  We do our own computations and cannot fully rely on theirs yet.<\/p> <p>  The area of natural resources comprises agriculture and the environment.  We have amounts, subject to audit, of &euro;58 billion.  The most likely error there is just above our materiality threshold of 2%.<\/p><p>It is 2.4%, which was the same as in the previous year.  Ireland did not feature in the sample of transactions that were tested.  Even within agriculture, there was a distinction, in that direct payments were free from material error while rural development and market measures were similar in measure to the cohesion expenditure and had a similar potential for errors.  This page also discusses non-compliance with procurement or grant award rules.  Rural development and market measures can be equated with higher risk cohesion-type cost reimbursement expenditure.<\/p><p> The error is 2.6%, which equates to almost &euro;4 billion.  This is not waste by nature.  For example, projects where we find problems with strict compliance with the rules can deliver what they were supposed to.  The impact of the projects has been positive, but from a purely legalistic point of view, we have had some problems.  On the other hand, projects that are completely legally and regular may not deliver what was expected of them.<\/p><p> There are errors, waste and fraud.  We are not fraud investigators as such but, as professional auditors, we must always be aware that there is the potential for fraud.  Where we suspect fraud, we report it to the European Anti-Fraud Agency, OLAF.  That happened in nine instances of suspected fraud during the 2018 audit.  The reasons included declarations of cost not meeting eligibility criteria and procurement irregularities, the latter of which is always an area of concern.  In other cases, people had artificially created the necessary conditions for EU financing.  In the overall scheme of things, however, fraud was not a significant issue in our sample.  Obviously, we would have preferred that there had been none, but nine is a low number.<\/p><p> Apart from financial compliance, we examined aspects of performance, which is an issue of equal importance.  It essentially concerns whether EU policy objectives are being reached.  Some shortcomings in the framework arose.  For instance, indicators on which performance was supposed to be measured were sometimes not well chosen.  In some cases, progress could not be calculated.  In others, data were of insufficient quality or unavailable.  Elsewhere, the targets set were not ambitious and would almost have been met by default, meaning they were not giving any added value.<\/p><p> As members can see from the chart, Ireland features second on the list of those states that absorb EU funds the quickest.  We were at approximately 45% by the end of 2018.  During the equivalent period of the previous programme in 2011, the figure was approximately 48%.  It is a small drop and the rate remains quite high.  The EU average has decreased from 33.4% to 27.3%, which is worrying at this stage, given that we are well into the 2014-20 programming period.  We do not want all of the expenditure to arise at the end when the next programming period is starting, as that would bring complications.<\/p><p> Linked to the matter of absorption is that of the outstanding commitments per member state.  Ireland figures well here, in that we were ranked low at &euro;900 million of outstanding European social and investment, ESI, funds commitments by the end of 2018.  It is quite a lot of money, but relative to general government expenditure, it is not significant.  For example, Poland had &euro;35 billion of outstanding commitments at the end of 2018, representing 17% of Poland's general government expenditure.  The correlation between the two is high.<\/p><p> That was the financial end of things, but we also conduct performance reports.  I have provided a brief introduction on the types of issue we encounter with the indicators and the framework.  The next page outlines some of the special reports we issued in 2018.  They are systematically provided to the committee.  The page shows them by EU multi-annual financial framework, MFF, heading.  There is a variety of tasks, including broadband, Horizon 2020, air passenger rights, the Turkey pre-accession aid and Turkey refugee facilities.  Under the sustainable resources heading are renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, flood prevention and animal welfare.  These climate issues are topical and we have started many more reports on them in our current work programme.  The financial and economic governance heading is something of a carryover from the financial crisis.  We still undertake some audits in that regard, but fewer than in the past.  Now, it is more about examining whatever supervisory mechanisms are in place.<\/p><p> In 2019, we issued the reports listed on the next page.  A number included Ireland in the sample.  The reports on farmers' payment schemes and cross-border healthcare did not, but it was included in the reports on EU-wide stress tests for banks, organic products and the vulnerability of e-commerce to tax fraud, which is topical, given the ongoing negotiations on customs and borders.  We also performed a review of the Commission's public consultation with EU citizens on various issues.<\/p><p> Of our upcoming reports in the next few months, some will be Irish-relevant.  For example, Ireland will feature in the samples for reports on biodiversity on farmland and cost effectiveness of EU-funded energy investments in buildings.  As such, there will be something to be said about Ireland in the final reports.  Other reports of general interest to Irish policymakers will be on pesticides and the EU's response to dairy market disruptions.  Reports of general public interest will include one on combating child poverty.  I am a reporting member for that work.  We will examine how the EU helps member states to address child poverty.  That it is on the increase in many member states is a sad indictment of where we are today.  Other reports will be on digitising European industry and trade defence instruments.  These pages give a flavour of some of the reports that we have published or that are in the pipeline.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.  I am open to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.

I also thank him for his hospitality in April.  I was the only member from this committee there, although three colleagues from the finance committee were also present.  It was one of the most worthwhile Oireachtas trips I have been on.  It was fascinating to see the work of the ECA and how that tied into the wider institutions.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions on the report and one on something that might be happening in a room in Luxembourg.  Mr. Murphy mentioned the nine referrals to OLAF.  What sorts of referral were they, what did they entail and at what level were they?  What happens to non-absorbed funds?  We are coming to the end of a budgetary cycle.  Do the funds go back into the pot and can they be reused?<\/p> <p>  Bearing in mind what is happening with Brexit, we are completing the end of this MFF cycle and moving into the next one.  We touched on the budget formulation process in Luxembourg at the time, but is there more information available now that we are six months further down the track?  Have there been delays in the formulation process?  Will Mr. Murphy put into context the impact of Brexit on the European budget?  How much less or, in certain areas, more money will there be?<\/p> <p>  Since my next question might be political, if Mr. Murphy is unable to answer it, that is fair enough.  When the then European Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources, Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger, appeared before us approximately 12 months ago, he spoke about how the future budget would be different from previous budgets.  We know the political emphasis placed on changing levels of expenditure, with CAP and the national environment wing of the budget receiving attention, but the security element is emerging.  The Commissioner was specific that spending on security would have to increase.  To what extent does Mr. Murphy estimate the expenditure levels will change?  In his role as an auditor, can the court truly measure the success of the budgetary impact on security?  CAP is not easy to measure, but it has been ongoing for so long and the numbers are clear to us all to read.  Measuring security is a little different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#C00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentation.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe that expenditure throughout the European Union is efficient and effective?  What is the most common problem with state aid that turned up in the course of the examination?  Where did those deviations occur?<\/p> <p>  On climate change, to what extent has the European Court of Auditors, ECA, compared the performance in the European Union in regard to less reliance on fossil fuels and greater investment in renewables?  Has it examined expenditure concerning the type of renewables, the effectiveness and the efficiency of the climate change programme, as well as results?<\/p> <p>  To what extent has expenditure on pesticides being examined?  Will replacements for pesticides achieve similar results?  How effective will expenditure be in that area?  A suggestion has been made in some quarters that if the use of pesticides across the European Union is changed, there will be a dramatic drop in production, in particular cereal production.  To what extent was technical evidence presented to bring about a change?  Again, how effective is spending in that area?  Is it money well spent or poorly spent?  What does the ECA see there for the future?<\/p> <p>  A certain blame for climate change is being attached to rural Ireland and the agrifood sector.  I believe, however, that rural Ireland and the agrifood sector can make a major contribution to alleviating the problems causing climate change through renewable energy, afforestation, hydroelectric schemes, wind energy schemes and others.  I know these developments are stronger in some EU countries than in others.  To what extent does the ECA see money being well spent strategically in that area?  How effective has it been so far?<\/p> <p>  Some experts here in Ireland - I use the word &ldquo;experts&rdquo; loosely &ndash; claim that rural dwellers contribute more to global warming than anybody else.  I do not agree with that.  I believe rural dwellers have an equal contribution to make.  They are in a position themselves to monitor how to have a programme of less reliance on fossil fuels and a shift over to other energy sources.  I will give a simple example where I carried out my own experiment.  In my house I put in a wood-burning stove and triple-glazed windows.  In one fell swoop, I reduced my costs on home heating oil by 60%.  That was also in a cold winter when there was severe demand and usage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#D00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The ECA&rsquo;s annual report stated the current performance indicators do not always reflect the effectiveness of the EU budget.  In what ways do the witnesses think the performance indicators can be made a more accurate measurement of effectiveness?  Have their recommendations in this regard been adopted or already implemented by the European Commission?<\/p> <p>  The ECA&rsquo;s annual report stated that in 2018, two thirds of the EU budget was spent through shared management programmes, which are managed by member states.  Natural resources funding covers the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the Common Fisheries Policy and part of the EU spending on the environment and climate action.  In 2018, the CAP accounted for 98% of natural resources funding.  The ECA found that the complex eligibility conditions for rural development market measures, fisheries environment and climate action increased the risk of error in these spending areas.  Direct payments made to farmers made up 72% of the EU&rsquo;s natural resources funding.  It was free of material error in 2018.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; views on these issues?<\/p> <p>  If we are banned from using certain chemicals in agriculture and there is a gradual withdrawal from the use of other chemicals, particularly in farming practices, that will have a serious negative financial knock-on effect.  How can that be handled?  The people who have made these suggestions do not realise the implications on the ground and how much those chemicals are needed.  It is an unusual matter.  It equally affects people with good land and poor land.  I can see awful knock-on consequences down the road.  If farmers will be unable to purchase chemicals for farming practices, it will have a serious negative impact on their incomes.  For example, many years ago, a dip used for sheep was deemed to be environmentally unfriendly.  A weakened type of dip was made available.  That has had a negative impact on farming.  When it comes to animal husbandry, people needed something that had a bit of bite in it.  Now people do not have that and it is affecting farming.  The same will happen with pesticides and chemicals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#D00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation, which has a serious job to do.<\/p> <p>  The way we operate European Union regulations is way above and beyond anything else in Europe.

My son has a farm which has an area beside a river which had to be cut off.  The Department is trying to exclude that.  It is outrageous what is going on.  Farmers are being harassed.  They are having problems with prices and they are being over-supervised.  We have more inspections in a single year.

All I am saying is that they should lay off, because farmers are being driven absolutely mad.  Fortunately my son and my wife run the farm and they are well qualified to provide all the information in respect of tags, tests and all those requirements.  Farmers are under enormous pressure whether it is coming from the European Union or Kildare Street.  From my general experience when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, adherence to the regulations here is way beyond any other country.  I would say the same in respect of sanitary facilities.  We have a pub and we had to put in disabled toilets, we naturally had to put in women's and gents' toilets, plenty of them.  In restaurants and bars in Barcelona or Paris disabled people cannot get down to the basement where the toilets are and there are no lifts.  They are just not adhering to the regulations as we are.  We must be the most adherent country of the 27 member states, or 28 as it is now.  I do not know if it is coming from the witnesses' office in Luxembourg or where but farmers are under enormous pressure at the moment.

As Senator Richmond already stated, some of them may be a bit political for us and go beyond our mandate.  In response to Senator Richmond's questions, the nine referrals are basically cases where we just have a suspicion that something is not quite right.  We really do not want to compromise any future investigation because the experts in this field are in OLAF and they have the proper criminal investigators.  We do not want to ruin any potential trail that has to be followed.  They vary from the artificially created - someone setting up a false business so that everything looks fine on paper but it is just a falsehood - to public procurement where it is not just an error but we think there is something more sinister behind it, that it is really a deliberate attempt to make sure there is not fair competition or to restrict procurement to a single bidder by making the thing so specific that nobody else could tender for it.  These are the kind of issues.<br\/><br\/>On the non-absorbed funds, there is a rule called end plus three.  Three years after the end of the programming period, the money lapses if it has not been claimed.  The member states can still claim money from that programming period up to the end of 2023.  There is a proposal for the new 2021-27 programming period to shorten this back to end plus two, as it was before.  The longer this thing goes on, the more it eats into the next programme period.  There is so much effort going into spending the money from the previous period that the implementation and take-off of the following period just takes a long time.<br\/><br\/>There are delays in the budget formulation process for sure.  The expectation many moons ago was that this current Commission would finalise the negotiations and that the budget would already be agreed at that stage.  We are now looking at sometime next year hopefully.  It has to be resolved sooner rather than later.  The focus so far has been on fixing where we are with Brexit and the implications that will also have for the budget.  In terms of what it will mean, it is very difficult to say.  There are rumours of 10% or 15% cuts across different policy areas.  It would be unfair to say that because, in a way, the fun will really start with the budgetary negotiations between the member states.  Certain member states want to retain the importance of the Cohesion Fund and do not want the budget to be cut there, while other member states, perhaps ourselves included, want agriculture and the CAP to be maintained or even increased.  It is going to be a matter of fighting for what is left in a reduced budget.  That brings in the issue of security as well.  This is what I was trying to say in terms of 1% of GNI to the EU budget.  Sometimes all these extra demands come on the EU budget without member states wanting to pay for it.  As was said, if a lot of money has to be put into security, it will have to be cut somewhere else unless member states are willing to pay more.  It is a matter of getting what we pay for, if I can put it like that.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy Durkan's comment on being efficient and effective, I tried to explain that we have two aspects, the legalistic compliance aspect and our performance.  There are definitely weaknesses in the performance framework and how we can measure certain policies.  Overall, people try to spend in an efficient and effective way but that does not always produce the results we wanted in the first place.  We still have some work to do on that.  There is a proposal in the court that we will have a separate annual report next year on performance.  That might help address some issues.  It will be more focused on the performance aspects and may help address some of the issues the Deputy raised in several of his questions.  On state aid, in any case where the state aid goes to DG Competition and the Commission, they normally rule on it.  Where we are finding problems, we have a disagreement in the interpretation of the applicable rules.  For instance, in some of the errors we think the aid intensity is too high.  We had a particular problem with the absence of the incentive effect.  If it is not there, for us that is an error.  There can be undetected state aid or state aid not being notified; sometimes it would have been allowed if it was notified but it is not notified so no one is aware of it.  Monitoring of formal requirements is sometimes not met.  It is a variety of things, I would say, in terms of state aid.  <br\/><br\/>On climate change, and it is probably the same for the questions on pesticides and rural Ireland, I would put them all in a group and say these are issues for the Commission Directorate Generals that are directly involved such as DG Agriculture and Rural Development, DG Health and Food Safety or whatever.  What we are doing afterwards is basically auditing the decisions they have taken.  We are not a party to the political process or discussions on which pesticides should or should not be banned.  The Commission services use the experts in the field, as it were.  We come along and see what the outcome is and how it is implemented.  We might like to think we have a bigger role than we have in that regard but we do not.  We are basically auditors.  We see what has happened and how the political decisions, programme and objectives are implemented <i>ex post<\/i>.  That also goes a bit to what the Chair was saying on the pesticides.<br\/><br\/>On shared management, it is like anything.  When there are more actors involved it is more complicated.  We have shared management between the Commission and the member states.  Cohesion is where we have problems because there are a lot of actors involved.  We have the audit authorities in the member states, the Commission and the Ministries.  It is really a big chain of people who are involved in implementing EU funds.  On performance indicators, hopefully the report we will have next year will address some of those issues in a clearer way.  At the moment, all we are saying is that we have issues with the framework, whether the indicators set are good or not.  Next year, we hope to be able to come with something that says whether objectives are being met in particular policy areas.  I would highlight real performance impact.  One of the big issues we have is that indicators are often for output rather than impact.  Output is just saying how many people have done a training course.  It is good that people are trained but the real thing is the impact.  Has it made a difference?  Has it made them more employable?  Has it led to employment?  That is where we are looking to see that those type of indicators would be better.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Leyden raised an interesting point.  It is not coming from us.  We are auditors.  We are there to see if rules are being applied.  The people who set the rules are the legislators, that is, the European Parliament and the European Council on the basis of proposals from the European Commission.  They are set by that triumvirate, if one likes.  Nonetheless the Senator raises a very interesting point.  We have come across cases, I am not saying in Ireland particularly because Ireland did not feature in our sample, where national rules are more demanding than EU rules and it causes problems.  We call that gold-plating.<\/p><p>The problem for us is that where the national rules are more demanding than the EU rules under the regulations we have to apply the national rules, which, as I said, are more strict and demanding than the EU rules.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>That is my experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#F00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019101600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>On the State aid issue, I am critical of the State aid rules and regulations.  For example, in regard to housing in this country we are restricted in the degree to which we can provide local authority housing, which is the traditional method of housing provision in this country.  This is part of the taxation policy of this country and adjoining countries.  It has always been the case that people in a particular income category can avail of local authority housing, thereby reducing their requirement for a wage increase at any particular time.  This provision is badly restricted at this time and what we are doing is not good value for money.

As the Chairman said, I am joined today by Helen O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal.<br\/><br\/>I hope to provide this hearing with the background to the Government decision to approve the General Scheme of the Human Tissue (Transplantation, Post-Mortem, Anatomical Examination, and Public Display) Bill, and to briefly outline the main provisions.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the human tissue Bill will create a modern legislative framework for consent for activities involving human organs and tissue.  The introduction of legislation in this area is a priority for the Minister for Health and it will give effect to two commitments in the programme for Government: to prioritise the passage of the human tissue Bill; and to propose legislation for family consent and an opt-out register for organ donation.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the Bill proposes to regulate the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons; provide general conditions for the removal, donation and use of organs and tissues from deceased and living persons for the purposes of transplantation; and provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation, and for an associated register.<br\/><br\/>The principles underlying the proposals are that consent would be the defining principle underpinning activities involving human organs and tissue; protection of the bodily integrity of the individual before and after death; respect for the autonomy of the individual and the rights of the bereaved; and, promotion of the public health benefits of organ donation and post-mortem examination.<br\/><br\/>The key recommendation of the report of Dr. Deirdre Madden on post-mortem practices and procedures<i><\/i>was that no hospital post-mortem examination should be carried out, and no organ retained for any purpose whatsoever, without authorisation.  The general scheme of the Bill will extend this principle to transplantation, anatomical examination, education and training and public display.<br\/><br\/>The development of this general scheme of the Bill has been a collaborative process.  Two public consultations on the proposals were held, the latest in 2017.  Stakeholders consulted through the drafting process included patient representative groups, the Medical Council, the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Office of the State Pathologist, the Coroners Society of Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General.<br\/><br\/>The proposed legislation is designed to be compatible with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the coroners Acts.  It will repeal the Anatomy Act of 1832.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the Bill comprises six parts.  Part 1 deals with standard provisions such as interpretation.  It includes provisions for the storage, handling, transportation, disposal and return of organs and tissue.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 outlines provisions in respect of transplantation.  The general scheme of the Bill covers the transplant of both organs and tissues and outlines the requisite consent provisions in regard to deceased and living donors.<br\/><br\/>Transplantation is currently the only available treatment for end-stage heart, lung and liver failure.  It is the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage kidney disease and it brings enormous clinical and social benefits to patients who would otherwise remain on dialysis.  The success of transplantation, in terms of life years gained and improvements in quality of life for patients, as well as advances in treatment generally, has resulted in an increase in the number of patients for whom transplantation is considered to be a viable option.  At the end of September this year, 577 people were on transplant waiting lists in Ireland, 499 of whom were on the kidney transplant list.  Worldwide, the most significant problem affecting transplant programmes is the shortage of suitable organs to transplant.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the Bill proposes to introduce an opt-out system of organ donation.  This approach has been widely adopted across Europe.  Currently, the decision on organ donation in the case of a deceased person rests with that person&rsquo;s next-of-kin, even in cases where the deceased person had an organ donor card or had indicated their wish to be an organ donor on their driving licence.  Under the proposed opt-out system, consent will be deemed unless a person has, while alive, registered his or her wish not to become an organ donor after death.  The intention is to make organ donation the norm in situations where donation is possible.<br\/><br\/>A soft opt-out system is proposed.  Even though consent is deemed, the next-of-kin will, in practice, always be consulted prior to removing any organ.  If the next-of-kin objects to the deemed consent, the donation will not proceed.  Feedback from the public consultations, and from organisations involved, supports the continued role of the next-of-kin in the final decision on individual organ donations.<br\/><br\/>Under the proposed system, individuals who do not wish to donate can opt out.  An organ donation opt-out register will be established and maintained by Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, ODTI.  If an individual has opted out through including his or her details on the register, they will not be considered for organ donation after their death and the views of the family will not be sought.  The ODTI has commenced work on setting up the register.  Appropriate safeguards will be included to ensure that the information is correct, that it represents the individual&rsquo;s current views and that general data protection regulation, GDPR, requirements are met.  Only the individual involved will be able to include him or herself on the register.  Also, it will be possible for individuals to remove their name from the register at any time.<br\/><br\/>The proposed soft opt-out system recognises the practical need for family co-operation to obtain social and medical information about the donor.  Safeguarding a future potential organ recipient involves the completion of a comprehensive donor lifestyle questionnaire which requires the co-operation of the next-of-kin.<\/p><p>The introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation is part of a range of initiatives being taken to increase the availability of organs for donation.  They include the establishment of a national organ procurement service; the appointment of clinical leads for organ donation and organ donation nurse managers in each hospital group; the planned national organ retrieval service; and the retrieval of organs in more complex donor cases.  The legislative proposals will be accompanied by a publicity campaign, the aim of which will be to boost organ donation, ensure people understand the opt-out system and encourage them to share their wishes for organ donation with their families.  <\/p><p> The general scheme also provides for consent procedures and general conditions for the removal, donation and use of organs and tissue from living persons for transplantation and human application.  The Bill includes a provision to prohibit the trafficking of organs and the removal and transplantation of organs outside an official transplant centre, thus facilitating Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs. <\/p><p> Part 3 of the general scheme covers pathology practice or post mortems.  This involves hospital post mortems or non-coroner post mortems only.   The general scheme outlines the consent required for a hospital post mortem; who can undertake a post mortem; the purposes for which a post mortem may be undertaken; and provisions for the retention, storage, use, disposal and return of organs and tissue from deceased persons following a post mortem.  The legislation will stipulate that individuals may not be paid for organs and tissue that have been removed as part of a post mortem and that such organs and tissue cannot be used for commercial purposes. <\/p><p> Part 4 covers anatomical examination.  The Anatomy Act 1832 will be repealed and replaced with provisions appropriate to the current requirements of medical education.  Provisions governing consent for anatomical examination, as well as the practice, licensing and governance of such examination, are included.  The central pillar of these provisions is informed consent.  An adult may, prior to his or her death, consent to the donation of his or her body or body parts for anatomical examination.  Full and clear information should be provided outlining the nature of the anatomical examination activities, the length of time the donated body or body parts will be retained, arrangements for disposal and any other information deemed to be appropriate.  The general scheme provides that anatomical examination, for the purposes of studying the structure of the human body, may only be practiced in a licensed institution, one of the five anatomy schools in Ireland.  Anatomical examination, for the purposes of ongoing education and training in surgical and clinical procedures, may only be practised using a specimen loaned or transferred from a licensed institution.  The import and export of specimens for anatomical examination is also covered.   <\/p><p> Part 5 provides that a licence will be required for the public display of bodies after death and outlines the requirements to be fulfilled when applying for a licence.  The provisions also outline the consent arrangements required and stipulate that only individuals who are authorised by the Medical Council may import or export specimens for public display.  Offences and penalties are outlined in Part 6.  <\/p><p> Work has commenced on the drafting of the Bill in collaboration with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Department hopes to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Bill by the end of quarter 1 of 2020 and that, subject to other legislative priorities, the Bill will progress through both Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of quarter 3 of 2020.  <\/p><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for undertaking this pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  We look forward to receiving the committee&rsquo;s report which will make a valuable contribution in the further development of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Conroy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss the Bill.  I am a consultant lung transplant physician based at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and the director of Organ Donation Transplant Ireland, ODTI.  I am also the chairman of the national organ donation and transplant advisory group, NODTAG, which informs and supports ODTI.  The NODTAG includes representation from the three national transplant centres and the intensive care medicine community.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Fiona Hammond, chief operations officer of ODTI.<\/p> <p>  ODTI is the delegated body for organ donation and transplant and performs the functions assigned to the HSE.  It is authorised by the HPRA in accordance with SI 325 of 2012, European Communities Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation.  It is the responsible national body for the independent co-ordination and safe management of organ procurement through the National Organ Procurement Service, NOPS.  This involves collecting organs and moving them to transplant centres.  The NOPS co-ordinates the organ donation process with the support of the three national transplant centres, namely, the National Renal Transplant Centre in Beaumont University Hospital, the National Liver and Pancreas Transplant Centre, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and the National Heart and Lung Transplant Centre in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital <\/p> <p>  ODTI works closely with the intensive care services throughout the country from the point of referral to the safe hand-over of donated organs for transplant surgery.  It acts as a confidential communication channel for donor families and recipients of organs.  It also provides access to supports for families who have donated organs. <\/p> <p>  ODTI is underpinned by robust quality processes and has a quality management system which provides for benchmarking against EU standards.  This ensures safety for the donor, families and transplant recipients.  <\/p> <p>  ODTI welcomes the introduction of the Human Tissue Bill and the inclusion of a &ldquo;soft opt-out&rdquo; approach to organ donation.  In Ireland there are 577 individuals listed for life saving transplant surgery.  Historically, organ donation in Ireland has functioned on the basis of voluntarism and clinical interest in organ donation.  Continual improvements in healthcare such as early intervention and enhanced treatments for stroke patients and a very welcome 60% reduction in the number of deaths in road traffic accidents in the past ten years have reduced the traditional organ donation events.  Therefore, organ donation continues to be a very rare event.  Of 31,000 deaths each year in Ireland, there is an average of 80 multi-organ donations per annum.  While Ireland performs well when compared to other European counterparts, organ donation rates are consistently dominated by those countries that provide for both opt-out consent and have robust organ donation infrastructure.  My submission includes a map showing the other countries that use a soft opt-out approach, to which the United Kingdom has recently moved.  Spain is widely acknowledged as having the leading model of a system that has increased the rate of organ donations.  It operates a soft opt-out system.  However, the Spanish national body for organ donation and transplant, ONT, Organizaci&oacute;n Nacional de Trasplantes, emphasises the importance of organ donor infrastructure to support organ donation.  It entails the availability of key donation personnel, donor co-ordinators, to support families through the organ donation process.   <\/p> <p>  In 1989, 14 per million of the Spanish population donated organs.  With the changes to the approach adopted in recent decades, this figure has risen to 45 donations per million of population.  Significantly, 30% of donations in Spain are from individuals aged over 70 years which compares to a figure of less than 6% in Ireland.  While organ donation from older individuals is feasible, it is medically more complex and requires appropriate infrastructure in order to execute the transplant safely.  My submission includes a table which shows where Ireland sits in a European context.  We should acknowledge that, thankfully, Ireland has low death rates.  As we are in the business of saving lives, we are in the middle of the table overall, but there is room for improvement.<\/p> <p>  Recognising the many benefits that accrue from transplantation, the United Kingdom has invested substantially in organ donation and transplantation.  In 2008 in the United Kingdom an organ donation task force made a series of recommendations to enhance national organ donation rates.  They have resulted in a 75% increase in organ donation rates.<\/p><p><i>Per capita<\/i>, the UK spends significantly more than Ireland on organ donation infrastructure.  There is currently a significant infrastructure deficit in regard to organ donation in our health service.  In table II of our submission we have benchmarked Ireland against our closest neighbour, Northern Ireland and against the best in Europe.  As can be seen, we operate with about one third of the equivalent organ donation infrastructure.  There is clearly a spread across Europe in how in the infrastructure is deployed.  <br\/><br\/>Organ donation typically occurs with a diagnosis of brain death, which is actually a very uncommon form of death, frequently occurring as a result of injury to the brain.  An alternative, modern technique, which is called deceased cardiac donation, or DCD, allows organ donation after the heart stops beating.  This approach has allowed many EU countries to safely enhance their number of donations.  The UK has made significant progress by focusing on this form of donation.  Currently up to 40% of all UK donations occur in these circumstances.  Overall, in any population, cardiac death is the most common mechanism of death but because blood flow is interrupted, preservation of the organs is more complex.  Consequently, donation after the heart stops beating places extra demands on surgical retrieval staff, who are then displaced and unavailable for subsequent transplant surgery.  Therefore, in keeping with international experience, the combination of donations from older people and deceased cardiac donation, with the adoption of a soft opt out, should allow donation rates in Ireland to increase.  Appropriate organ donation infrastructure would save many lives and decrease the burden of costly interventions such as dialysis which costs around &euro;65,000 per annum versus approximately &euro;12,000 for kidney transplant surgery.  Table III illustrates the success of the renal services in this country, with an increasing number of people sustained on dialysis over the last decade.  ODTI will continue to work with the Department of Health in securing appropriate infrastructure funding for donation and transplant services in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>An organ donation opt-out register is central to the human tissue Bill which provides that such a register will be established and maintained by ODTI.  Spain does not operate a register and relies on organ donation personnel to support families through the process.  In contrast, the UK currently operates both a positive register, where people declare their desire to be a donor and a negative register, where people declare that they do not want to be a donor.  The British have invested heavily in that.  The proposed Irish register will be provided for those individuals who do not wish to participate in organ donation after death.  We anticipate this will represent approximately 5% of the population based on an analysis of what happened in Wales when it introduced a similar system.  ODTI is currently working to scope the operational and technical requirements of the development of the national register.  As this is a complex project, ODTI will have the support and expertise of the HSE's office of the chief information officer, OCIO.  The project will develop the operational processes that allows for a GDPR-compliant national opt-out register for organ donation, including the secure hosting of its national database.  ODTI will identify the safest and most cost effective electronic register for demographic identifiers of individuals who wish to register an objection to organ donation.  Working with the OCIO, ODTI will ensure the inclusion of an ability to link to a national individual health identifier, IHI, when it becomes available.  The register will also provide a mechanism to allow people to alter their information on the register or to revoke their objection should they wish to do so at a future date.  ODTI will ensure the register will not be open to inspection by the public.  As per the proposed legislation, it is intended that ODTI may share information only with relevant medical staff for the purpose of determining if the deceased person&rsquo;s family members may be approached to discuss organ donation.  This capability must be available to the entire acute hospital network, on a 24\/7 basis, 365 days per year.  It is intended that target medical staff will include organ donation nurse managers, intensive care consultants with special interest in organ donation, intensive care consultants, intensive care nurses and emergency medicine consultants.<br\/><br\/>ODTI wishes to highlight the need for a robust national public awareness campaign to support the introduction of a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation and for the associated register in Ireland.  This will be required in advance of the introduction of a soft opt-out consent system.<br\/><br\/>Organ donation saves lives and should be the society norm.  Of 31,000 deaths in Ireland, donation occurs on average only 80 times each year.  There are currently 577 people awaiting transplant surgery.  The Irish health service operates with one third of the equivalent international infrastructure for organ donation and transplant.  ODTI provides a framework for organ donation and transplantation and each year publishes an activity report which is accessible to the public.  We have included some European league tables in our submission so that committee members can benchmark us against our European counterparts.

We are dedicating our presentation to former Senator, Feargal Quinn, who sadly passed away earlier this year.  He was a fantastic champion of organ donation and was very supportive of the soft opt-out system.<\/p> <p>  Organ donation is a precious gift that saves lives.  In large part due to a shortage of organs, people continue to die in Ireland unnecessarily while on the waiting list for organs they desperately need in order to preserve and enhance their lives and health.  One organ donor can potentially save seven lives.  There are also benefits to their families, Irish society in general, the Irish health system and the wider economy in promoting transplantation.  That is why IDN is committed to encouraging transplantation and to increase the numbers of donors and of lives saved.  In this context, IDN warmly welcomes the introduction by the Minister for Health and the Irish Government of the human tissue Bill 2019, and in particular the provisions to provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation and for an associated register.  We note that this change is also widely supported by most political parties in Ireland, the medical community and by the vast majority of relevant patient groups and the general public.  We also note that it is an important part of the programme for Government.  <\/p> <p>  However, we also wish to make clear in this submission that the ambition to make more organs available for transplant may be blunted or may not reach full potential if it is not accompanied by the necessary supporting resources and infrastructure.  In particular, we need more organ retrieval surgeons and donor nurse specialists in our major intensive care units in our hospitals.  We also need improved hospital infrastructure and staffing levels in the three transplant centres at the Mater, Beaumont and St. Vincents&rsquo; hospitals, including pre- and post-operative rooms and sufficient access to operating theatres.<\/p><p>We also need sufficient resources for a national public awareness programme and register, and some modest resources to help patient groups to support the public awareness campaign that will accompany the human tissue Bill. <\/p><p> The Irish Donor Network is made up of the following patient groups: the Alpha One Foundation; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Support Ireland; Children&rsquo;s Liver Disease Ireland; Disease Support Ireland; Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, which is my organisation; Cystinosis Ireland; the Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association; and the Irish Lung Fibrosis Association, which is represented here today.  Soft opt-out is also supported by the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Thoracic Society and the Irish Hospice Foundation and many other key stakeholders concerned with organ donation and transplantation in Ireland.<\/p><p> I will now turn to why the Irish Donor Network supports the human tissue Bill and soft opt-out.  The IDN strongly supports the introduction of a soft opt-out system for organ donation, which basically means an opt-out system with inherent safeguards.  The IDN has been campaigning for such a system for many years.  Under the proposed new system, the donor&rsquo;s next of kin would still be consulted, but deceased donors&rsquo; consent would be presumed unless there is evidence that they did not wish to donate.  An alternative approach is the hard opt-out system, which has been tried in other countries including Austria, where next of kin are not consulted.  This system has been shown not to work.  It was tried in Austria and it failed, so we certainly would not suggest that system be brought into Ireland.<\/p><p> While it is always challenging to make direct comparisons with other countries, the decision to bring a soft opt-out system into Ireland follows the success of soft opt-out in many other EU countries, including in Austria, Spain and Belgium.  There has also been a strong momentum growing in the UK to introduce soft opt-out in recent years.  In England, the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Act has passed through the UK Parliament, with implementation due to start in April 2020.  This will replace the present on line opt-in and opt-out system that has failed to deliver and which should not be considered for Ireland.  Under the existing system in the UK, only 38% of the UK population has registered their wish to opt in on the existing online organ donor register, which is why most UK health bodies concerned with transplant are now seeking to replace this system with the approach that we are advocating for Ireland.  The IDN does not want to import an opt-in and opt-out system into Ireland, because this system has clearly demonstrated failure in England.<\/p><p> Donor cards, apps, and codes on drivers' licences are worthy additions to a programme, and we pay tribute to the work of the Irish Kidney Association in developing these excellent public awareness initiatives.  We believe there is no reason these initiatives would not continue into the future.  They are not, however, a substitute for a comprehensive organ donor consent legislative process and a system based on evidence.<\/p><p> In Scotland, a new Bill was enacted in July 2019.  In Wales, such a system has now been in place since 2015.  Of 160 organ transplants in 2017 in Wales, 39 were organs transplanted using its deemed consent system.  Only 6% of people opted out of the system in Wales.  Authoritative research published by the British Medical Journal concluded that the change in Wales had a positive impact on donation but stressed the importance of resourcing transplant and donation infrastructure.<\/p><p> The groups involved in the IDN have been involved in supporting organ donation for many years.  The IDN believes that, as part of a broader strategy, including improvements in organ donation and transplantation infrastructure with resourcing and organisation, a shift to an opt-out system will have a positive impact on donation rates.  Independent research carried out by the University of York, which I will go into in detail, showed four major methodologically sound studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without soft opt-out and found that the practice of soft opt-out has been proven to increase organ donation in three of the four studies.<\/p><p> Research undertaken in Ireland shows that 80% or more support organ donation but only about a third of us tend to carry a donor card.  The IDN supports the principle behind an opt-out system, that if people do not object to their organs being used after death they should be used to save lives.  Under an opt-out system, individuals have the same choice as in an opt-in system - to donate or not to donate - so individual autonomy and choice are protected and respected under this proposed new system.  The proposed new system is simply a change in the way people&rsquo;s views are expressed.  All organ donation is a gift and should be recognised as such in the future, irrespective of the model of consent in place.  Families are often comforted by knowing something good has come from their loss.  The expectation of IDN is that, under a soft opt-out system, organ donation would become the default position which, over time, would change expectations in society and so become the societal norm.  Thus, there would be a shift where donation is a natural and expected thing to do.<\/p><p> We would also point to other aspects of the legislation that are important, such as the introduction of a living kidney sharing scheme.  This has worked very well and is called altruistic donation.  This allows a stranger and people who are not relatives to donate a kidney.  This is working very well in Northern Ireland and 89 donors have provided such support in recent years.  We also strongly support the public awareness programme and patient groups should be involved in this too.<\/p><p> People continue to die waiting for a transplant in Ireland.  The submission from the seven patient groups of the IDN contends that the momentum in Ireland for change is growing, as it is with our nearest neighbours in the UK.  As with all major changes, however, the introduction of soft opt-out needs to be accompanied by a persistent, continuing and adequately resourced public awareness programme, an online register and a significant additional investment in transplant infrastructure such as organ retrieval surgeons and other key specialised staff.  We are delighted to continue to play a supporting role in this change.  We hope that the living kidney sharing scheme would come in under the new legislation also.<\/p><p> IDN wishes to acknowledge the work of senior officials in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland and Professor Jim Egan, the HSE, and the Department of Health, led by Michael Conroy.  We also thank the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and all of the political parties here today.  We urge that this legislation is enacted as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt for his opening statement.

Our first mission was to introduce what was then the kidney donor card, raise public awareness about how kidney donation works and how it can be the gift of life.  As transplantation progressed to include more organs the kidney donor card became the organ donor card more than 20 years ago.<\/p> <p>  The role of the organ donor card has always been to prompt the organ donation conversation within families as informed consent is key to the success of the process.  Technology has allowed us to reach beyond the traditional card, as Mr .Watt mentioned, and we now also have a digital organ donor card app.  The same principle applies in that the app is there to promote conversation and as a reminder of the decision made.<\/p> <p>  For more than a decade we advocated for the introduction of an organ donor register.  This would offer a very clear call to action for the public and can be very easily established in such a way that facilitates the organ donation conversation.<\/p><p>With a register, Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, ODTI, would have for the first time a central record of an individual's decision to be an organ donor.  This would be consulted when a potential donor has been identified and knowing that a loved one had proactively recorded a wish to be an organ donor makes the family decision to consent a much easier proposition.<br\/><br\/>In putting an emphasis on soft opt-out with family consent, this Bill is misleading the public as it implies a change of practice, whereas the reality is that the practice stays the same.  Currently, a potential organ donor is identified, the family is approached and consent for retrieval is either given or not.  Under the proposals in this Bill, the public will have the opportunity to opt out of organ donation and if people do not opt out, they will be considered potential donors but the family will still be approached for final consent.  Where is the difference?<br\/><br\/>We want people to say &quot;Yes&quot; to organ donation but just as important, we want their families to also say &quot;Yes&quot;.  How do we do this?  We encourage conversation.  The public will only look at the headlines of this Bill and see that if they do not opt out then they are considered potential donors, the call to action will be removed along with the prompt for family conversation.  Do not just take my word for it as there are people a lot more learned than me who will say the introduction of a system of opt-out will not affect growth in deceased donors.  A paper entitled Comparison of Organ Donation and Transplantation Rates Between Opt-out and Opt-in Systems, which was published this year states, &quot;our data demonstrate no significant difference in deceased donation or solid organ transplantation activity between opt-out versus opt-in countries&quot;.  This other barriers to organ donation must be addressed even in settings where consent for donation is presumed.  The author concluded that greater emphasis on education and informing the general population about the benefits of transplantation is the preferred way to achieve an increase in organ donation.  These findings have important implications for transplant clinicians and health policymakers like this committee when considering the merits of organ donation strategies.<br\/><br\/>Another paper entitled Opt-out Legislation, the Mysterious Viability of the False, was written by Dr. Rafael Matesanz and Dr. Beatriz Dom&iacute;nguez-Gil, the retired and current leader of the most successful organ donation organisation in the world, Organizaci&oacute;n Nacional de Trasplantes, ONT, in Spain.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn summary, the evidence does not support that shifting towards presumed consent will solve organ shortage.  But still today, this measure is seen as a magic solution that departs from conviction that low deceased donation rates result only from a negative public attitude and poor contribution from society.  It results from ignoring that the key to success lies within the healthcare system.  We should never blame the population.  If people donate less, it must be something we have done wrong. <\/blockquote><p>This is from the leaders of the donation organisation in the most successful country in the world in this practice.<br\/><br\/>Head 19 of the Bill focuses on an opt-out only register and is a major missed opportunity.  Give the public an opportunity to opt in also.  The register would go from being viewed negatively by wider society to being a useful call to action and decision aid for families when their consent is sought.  The United Kingdom has had a register for 25 years and it also has detailed donor audit reports, which we do not, that show the evidence of the value of the register and the role of specialist nurses for organ donation.  Again, we have very few of them.  Only 30% of families consent when no specialist nurse is involved in the formal organ donation conversation with the family.  That increases to 57.5% consent when the specialist nurse is involved but the potential donor has not signed the donor register.  This increases again to 94% of families consenting to organ donation if a specialist nurse is involved and the potential organ donor has signed up to the register.  It is hard to argue with such statistics, which is raw evidence for the committee.<br\/><br\/>With respect to developing a &quot;Yes&quot; or opt-in register we are actually already in a very strong position, with 957,000 people who have the new format driving licence or driving permit choosing to have the code 115 added to their licence to indicate their wish to be an organ donor.  These data can easily be transferred to the Department of Health if the desire is there to make it happen.  We have a number of edits for the committee to consider.  My colleague, Mr. Whelan and I, worked on this for quite some time.  We have plenty of supporting materials that we believe will help the committee make a truly informed decision on the future of organ donation in Ireland.  I thank the committee for not presuming our consent to this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  I have an organ donor card that is probably a museum piece by now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>It is looking like it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is from 1989.

The donor card, which has been championed laudably by the Irish Kidney Association for four decades, is a call to arms.  It is a foil for discussion.  The register is potentially a more formal structure but, at the end of the day, the register in many ways ends up speaking to the converted.  With the infrastructure that the UK has put in, they at best get 40% of their population.  We would anticipate 5% to 10% of folk are not into this.  Then there is the population who will carry their donor card and will give.  We estimate that at best that is 40% of the population.  The remainder, 50%, are too busy and absolutely appropriately not thinking about organ donation.  The core issue is to have the medical staff and nursing staff there to support the families in the decision, an education programme, a public awareness programme and infrastructure to support those families.<\/p> <p>  There is no magic bullet.  It is about building a system like a jigsaw so that one has a comprehensive approach to organ donation.  As Mr. Murphy said, the Spaniards have achieved this over three decades.  We have made good progress since the European directive in 2012 but we are some way behind the sophistication of other jurisdictions.  We need to build that.<\/p> <p>  I emphasis that there is no magic bullet.  The legislation is not a magic bullet.  I was at pains to emphasise, while we have no legislation, that probably the jewel in the crown is the infrastructure to support the families.  We are in the business of saving lives and every effort is made to prevent somebody from dying.  In tragic circumstances, we hope to have the infrastructure in modern medicine, as compared to when I started in the business.  The intensive care units, the quality of care and the sophistication that goes on is breathtaking.  We hope that in the general population, underpinned by the legislation, the mood music will be that people will consider donation after death because it saves lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Jim Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Egan.

We think it is the best way forward.  The opt-out in and of itself is very important in that it gives a clear option to a person to opt out.  The thrust of the legislation relates to consent, and the background to it is the Madden report and issues relating to organ retention and so on.  That is very important on the one hand but, on the other, the idea of an opt-in register would have little status.  There was a conversation about the donor card, which is very worthwhile but does not have the status of a guarantee.  Much of the public thinks it does.  Contrary to some of the commentary, we think this legislation, with the publicity that will be needed and which was covered previously, will bring clarity to the public and encourage people to talk to their families.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question of how many people might register if there were opt-in and opt-out options and the number of people in the middle who would not avail of either option, we think there is a big fear, shared by a great many people in the donation transplant world in Ireland, that non-registration could sow a doubt in the minds of the next of kin and family members about the deceased favouring donation.  Someone might say an option was available to opt in and that the deceased did not avail of it so perhaps that was a purposeful decision.  This gives rise to a further element of doubt.  That is one of the major reasons we are not in favour of both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Conroy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for coming in and I wish Mr. McCutcheon a happy anniversary.

They cannot give a kidney up for sharing into a pool.  In the general scheme, it is proposed that provision will be made for non-directed altruistic kidney donation.  This is where a donation is to be made into a transplant pool.  There is no direction such as, \"I am not giving it to my brother\" or \"I am not giving it to my wife\".  The donor is just putting it into the pool for the common good.  In this situation, the donor cannot specify the recipient's race, gender or sexual orientation and, therefore, the donor makes the donation as an altruistic action.  While everybody around this table is in favour of increasing organ donation and transplantation, we want to ensure we are not unduly hasty in taking organs.  An independent panel, which will include psychologists, ethicists and so on, is being set up to improve such donations such that a potential candidate would in the first instance interact with, say, Beaumont Hospital if he or she thought there was a potential there.  If things were going in the right direction, the matter would be referred to the panel.  The panel would then go through a process to ensure there was no pressure of any kind on the donor and that he or she was in good physical and mental health.  These are just safeguards to protect the donor in these situations.  Such a process has been used extensively in other countries, including Northern Ireland, which has a successful living kidney donor programme.  This will bring us into line with the those countries.

I have represented for some time the transplant nurses in Beaumont Hospital.  They are the most amazing people but we just do not have enough of them.  They are brilliant at what they do, and I would be happy to put them in front of any family.  Nobody wants to have that conversation, but those people are the people to have it.

The latter scared people because people thought Ireland was bringing in the Austrian system that has presumed consent.  The option did not work anywhere.  Spain brought it in, it did not work and they eventually figured out what works.  Information works as do systems that are properly resourced, as Professor Egan and Mr. Conroy have pointed out.

Professor Egan referred to brain injury.  Will that aspect be provided for in the legislation?  Will there be clear guidance for consultants on how it will work or will things be left as they are?  It would be helpful if they were.  As Mr. Watt, Mr. Murphy and the other delegates are aware, the cost over a decade of people awaiting a transplant is nearly &euro;10 billion, which is big money.  How much would be saved if we were to put in place the system Professor Egan, Mr. Conroy and all others in the health service want?  We would save millions of euro.<\/p> <p>  Croatia had a system of presumed consent for kidney transplants and so on, but it did not work.  It realised that what was needed was nurses and a system for retrieving organs and transplanting them into people who needed them.  That is how we will save the health system money and it should be the aim of every health committee.  It is possible to achieve it through this legislation because people wait too long for a transplant under the current system.  Does Professor Egan know the number of people who died having been taken off a transplant list because they had become too ill while waiting for a transplant?  They died because the system was not working.<\/p> <p>  My driving licence has the code 115 noted on the back such that my niece will know to donate my organs when my time comes.  I will have nothing else to give away.  The roles of the committee and the delegates are so important because what matters is what works.  The Spanish health service discovered that what worked was nurses who specialised in organ donation.  What also works is knowledge, that is, a family knowing that their loved one wanted to be an organ donor.  Carrying an organ donor card is one way to impart that knowledge, if one is lucky enough to find it.  A person can also discuss the matter with his or her family.  If the video of my stating I wish to give away my organs can be retrieved, that is fine.<\/p> <p>  The system being proposed will not work.  The evidence shows - correct me if I am wrong - that 29.8% of families consent to donation without knowledge of their loved one's wishes or being asked to donate by a nurse.  The families just offer to donate the organs, which is great.  Some 57% give consent if they have no knowledge of their loved one's intentions but are asked to donate by a specialist nurse.  That is why we need specialist nurses.  That is why they were put in place in Spain.  Some 93.9% of families who they know what their loved one's intentions are and are asked to donate consent to the donation.  That is the success rate we want to achieve, but the legislation will not bring it about.  All it will do is create an opt-out system that will tell the families of people among the 2% to 5% - it is 6% in Wales - who will choose to opt out that their loved one did not wish to be an organ donor.  It is a negative measure.<\/p> <p>  Some 1 million people have indicated on their driving licence that they wish to be an organ donor.  I twice asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, whether he would give that information to the Department of Health.  He initially told me that he would not do so, citing data protection concerns.  I pointed out that the Department shared the information on persons' driving licences with eFlow, private clamping companies, car parking companies, the Garda, the Courts Service and approximately 15 other organisations, but he was not willing to share it with the Department of Health.  He has changed his tune and claimed that the Department of Health does not want the information.  The information that would help families to make the decision is often contained on a person's driving licence.  It is held by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but the Department of Health does not want it.  If it was handed over such that the family would be aware of their loved one's intentions and they were asked by a nurse to consider donation, it would increase the rate of organ donation to 93.9%.  Much of what we can do is available to us, although hospitals need further resources for nurses, which is important.  It is a systems failure.  The committee should suggest the legislation require the Department of Health to receive the information.  If the committee decides to approve the opt-out system, that information should also be available.  In potential cases of organ donation, the staff should make one telephone call to discover whether the person had opted out and, if not, another to ascertain whether he or she had indicated on his or her driving licence that he or she wished to be an organ donor.  I note Mr. Watt's observation that only 38% people in England indicated their wish to be a donor.  However, every inch we can move people along to make that decision will make a difference.  I ask that arising from this meeting the committee recommend that the information held on driving licences be utilised.  It is available, but the Department of Health does not want it, even though it would help families.  All it would take is a simple telephone call to the licensing authority under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#O01300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I agree with much of the Senator's analysis.

It seems at the end of the day that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet and all have the one aim, which is to increase organ donation.  I look back at my experience as a patient.

If my donor had been in a different hospital, the result clearly would have been different if that approach had not been made.  It seems to me that all the suggestions that have been made have been useful and constructive but the key one from the patient's perspective is that there must be the right connection in the hospital at the coalface, at the crucial time.  If that happens, organ donation will be increased.  The infrastructure must be there, with a coterie of properly and fully-trained specialist nurses who are able to communicate with the family.

The Irish Medical Organisation would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to discuss the critical issue of medical workforce planning and the crisis in medical staffing, which is having a significant impact on the delivery of healthcare services in Ireland.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, is the trade union and representative body for all doctors in Ireland and welcomes the opportunity to highlight the issues of recruitment and retention that exist across our health services in both the acute and community settings.<\/p> <p>  The main point we wish to make today is that the crisis in medical manpower this country is facing is having severe adverse effects on patients with growing waiting lists and inability to deliver appropriate and timely care.  During the austerity years we repeatedly warned that cuts to our health services would lead to a reduction in services, longer waiting lists and an inability to recruit and retain medical practitioners.  It gives us no pleasure to say this has now come to pass but we again use this opportunity to call on this committee and the Government to seriously address the deficits that exist in our medical workforce as to do so would improve the overall health of our nation. <\/p> <p>  The key contributing factors to the current crisis in medical manpower can be identified as including the absence of planning and investment for the number of doctors required to meet the health needs of a changing demographic of patients.  Also, Ireland's population is growing but the key factor in terms of planning is the increase in the rate of growth of those over the age of 60.  In order to meet the increased but expected needs of the population we need more doctors.  To put that in perspective, up to 2008, one in ten patients were over the age of 65, between 2008 and 2028, one in five patients will be over the age of 65 and, by 2040, one in four patients will be over the age of 65.  That gives members an idea of the scale of the problem that awaits us down the road.  The latest OECD figures show that with 1.44 specialists per 1,000 population, Ireland has the lowest number of medical specialists in the EU, with the EU average being 2.48 per 1,000 population.  The HSE's national doctor training and planning, NDTP, office shows approximately 520 consultant posts remain unfilled or filled on a temporary basis while figures obtained by the IMO show that almost half of consultant posts advertised by the HSE in 2018 received few suitable candidates or qualified applicants, or none at all.  The demographic of the workforce at specialist level is very challenging with a high level of expected retirements in the coming years.  More than 700 general practitioners are due to exit the system in the next five years, a quarter of consultants are due to retire in the next ten years and 50% of our public health specialists are due to retire in the next five years.  The direct consequences of this lack of planning are that in many areas such as consultant staffing levels, the staffing levels fall well below the recommended ratios by the national clinical programmes and colleges.  In orthopaedics, paediatrics and psychiatry, the consultant staffing levels are 50% below recommended staffing levels while in ophthalmology the staffing levels can be up to 70% lower than what is recommended.  More than 770,000 patients are currently on hospital waiting lists.  In many areas of the country patients cannot register with a GP due to lack of capacity which has a negative knock-on effect of increased presentations to an already stretched GP out-of-hours service and in emergency departments across the country. <\/p> <p>  A significant factor is that a poorly resourced health service and a hostile overly pressurised work environment are leading to high levels of emigration of doctors.  More than 700 graduates enter basic training each year in Ireland, however, we are training are doctors for export.  Since 2015, the number of voluntary withdrawals from the register has almost doubled from 828 to 1,453 in 2018.  Data from the Medical Council show that approximately a third are Irish graduates while almost a quarter leave the specialist register.  While a small percentage leave to retire, the vast majority, almost 70%, leave to practise medicine in another country.  Reasons cited include understaffing, expectation to carry out many non-core tasks, lack of respect, limited career progression, higher earnings abroad, family reasons, more flexible training options abroad, lack of support from employer, longer working hours, poor quality of training and the list goes on.  There is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that doctors are suffering from burnout due to the highly pressurised working environment and this, coupled with a lack of support from the employer, is a significant contributing factor to emigration.  Doctors are trained over many years to deliver high quality and appropriate care to patients.  The lack of investment in our public health services makes it almost impossible for doctors to deliver that care in a timely manner due to the lack of beds, understaffing, poor access to diagnostics and access to other healthcare professionals, including counselling services, occupational health services and physiotherapy.  This starts with GPs being unable to access timely referrals for patients and carries on through to the hospital system or community system with intolerable and dangerous waiting times for outpatient appointments and then in many cases long delays before the prescribed treatment can be delivered.  The health capacity report clearly identifies the deficits in terms of infrastructure within the system yet the policy of the Government is to significantly increase investment in the private system through the National Treatment Purchase Fund while starving the public system of the required investment.  Our GP workforce is also emigrating.  A survey by the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, of GP trainees and graduates in 2017 revealed that one in five recently qualified GPs had already emigrated, while a further 30% of newly qualified GPs were considering emigration.  While more than 50% of GP trainees envisage themselves as GP principals in a partnership or group practice in ten years&rsquo; time, and that signifies intent, concerns about the viability of general practice, financial prospects and quality of life are the key factors influencing their decision to migrate.  It is important to note that the recent GP agreement merely provided a pathway to reinstate the funds lost during the years of austerity and what is required is significant planned investment in the development of GP services for patients. <\/p> <p>  Another factor is the failure to make our public health services an employer of choice for medical professionals and a culture of disrespect of doctors by the employer and the Government.  Our doctors continue to emigrate to health systems that pay more, offer better supports and reasonable working environments and that value doctors.<\/p><p>Over the past five years, the IMO, on behalf of its members, has been forced by the Government and the HSE to take legal action to enforce legally binding contracts entered into by the employer.  This has been necessary to ensure doctors work safe and legal hours and to allow doctors to be represented in respect of contractual matters.  This does not assist in the development of a culture of respect in which employees are valued.  Consultants who were employed prior to 2012 were denied their contractual payments.  Those payments were eventually secured on foot of legal action.  Consultants who were employed after 2012 were subject to a discriminatory and unilateral cut of 30% in addition to the cuts applied across the public service.  The impact of this policy has been the HSE's inability to recruit consultants, which has led to more than 500 vacant posts and more than 100 non-specialist doctors working in consultant posts.  Examples of this shortcoming can be seen throughout the country.  It has been most recently evidenced by the inability to recruit sufficient consultants for the opening of the first phase of the national children's hospital and the increasing problems in psychiatry services.<\/p><p> Rather than increasing our consultant staffing levels, we are becoming increasingly reliant on foreign-trained doctors.  More than 40% of doctors who are registered in Ireland received their training overseas.  Research shows that most foreign-trained doctors intend to move on by returning home or migrating onwards.  They are concerned about deskilling and are disillusioned by the lack of training and career opportunities.  In effect, we are creating a transient workforce in perpetuity.  That is not good for the health service or for patients.  NCHD contracts are routinely breached by hospitals.  Doctors are forced to work in excess of legal hours and are not paid for all the hours worked.  Many of them have spoken of poor and inflexible training with poor career progression options.  Our research suggests that two thirds of NCHDs perceive pay to be the principal reason for emigrating.  Some 83% of them believe the pay disparity at consultant level will be a factor when they are deciding whether to apply for consultant posts in Ireland.  The pay disparities between consultants who were employed before and after 2012 are up to &euro;50,000 a year.  These colleagues are doing the same job and carrying the same level of responsibility.<\/p><p> Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries because specialists in public health medicine are not remunerated on an equal basis to other consultant specialists in the health system, even though they are required to be on the specialist register and must undergo specialist training.  If they were properly resourced, public health doctors could play a pivotal role in commissioning services, analysing health data, conducting needs assessments, assembling the evidence base for interventions, monitoring services and quality-assuring parts of the health service such as screening services.  The development of general practice is the cornerstone of many reform proposals, including Sl&aacute;intecare.  Until recently, GPs have been left to shoulder the burden of reduced funding while delivering a greater level of service.  There is no clear strategy or funding for the development of general practice.  All the factors that have led to this crisis have been much publicised and highlighted by the profession and the IMO for many years.  Lack of commitment, investment and respect by successive Governments and the HSE have led to low morale among the existing workforce and high levels of emigration.  There is an inability to recruit sufficient doctors to deliver existing levels of care or develop new services.  We are at a tipping point.  Unless we seriously address this problem, doctors fear for the health service and the safe delivery of care to patients.  More reports and promises of reform are not required by the health service and patients.  It is not helpful to talk about black holes in the health budget.  Contrary to the spin about high levels of health spending, the budget is insufficient to meet the needs of the population.  It is time for politicians and policymakers to be honest about this.<\/p><p> Immediate steps must be taken to resolve the medical manpower issue.  The discriminatory pay issue for consultants must be resolved.  Until this has been dealt with, there can be no new contract discussions, which are required for any reform measures, and we cannot hope to recruit consultants to our public health services.  There is no defence for the current policy.  The impact of this politically motivated 30% cut has been disastrous for patients and services.  There is a need to invest in capacity and supports within general practice to allow it to develop and deliver a fuller range of care in the community.  Eligibility for medical cards and doctor visit cards should be expanded on the basis of means or medical need, rather than on the basis of age.  The long-held tradition of successive Governments using medical cards as vote-getting exercises must stop.<\/p><p> The training of doctors must be modernised to reflect changes in the practice of medicine and in the demographics of doctors in training.  Initiatives are required to bring arrangements for the duration of training into line with international norms.  A differentiated model, which provides clearer career paths with greater predictability of training arrangements, responsibilities, locations and working conditions, must be developed in line with the recommendations of the report of the strategic review of medical training and career structures, which is known as the MacCraith review.  In excess of 700 doctors enter basic specialist training every year, but an average of just 484 doctors enter higher specialist training.  We are just about training enough specialists to replace the number of specialists who leave the register each year.  There seems to be a mismatch in the number of posts on offer.  Approximately 55 higher specialist training posts are not filled each year in other specialties.  There are insufficient training posts on offer to meet demand or the shortage of consultants in that speciality.  Vacant posts in public health and community health are putting health planning and the delivery of vital vaccination and screening programmes at risk.  The Crowe Horwath report, which was commissioned by the Department of Health, must be implemented to improve the role and function of public health specialists and the training and career structure of public health medicine.  Its implementation is required to ensure public health specialists are valued and offered contractual terms in line with other specialists.<\/p><p> Doctors want to work in a system in which they can care for patients.  That is why we became doctors.  Care delayed is care denied.  The cost of denying care has never been assessed in terms of the personal cost to the patient's quality of life, the cost to the system of delivering more expensive and complex care at later stages and the cost to society of days of work lost and benefit payments as many patients await care that will allow them to live full and productive lives.  We need reform that makes a difference to patients.  Any reform is simply impossible in the context of the current medical workforce crisis.  In the absence of significant and appropriate investment, reports and reform proposals are making the situation worse rather than better.  There can be no hope of reforming the system, or developing new and much needed services, if the current level of understaffing in the system persists.  We must have a system that cares for patients and values doctors.  We have seen the consequences of a system that does neither.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGarry.

It is difficult to know where to start with his statement.  It is pretty damning stuff.  It depicts a healthcare system and a workforce in crisis.  How many doctors are we short?  Dr. McGarry might start with the hospitals before moving onto GPs.  There are meant to be approximately 3,300 hospital consultants, but we are approximately 500 short in terms of full-time posts.  Even if an additional 500 consultants were recruited tomorrow, Ireland would still have the lowest number of hospital consultants anywhere in Europe.  It can be estimated that to get to the European average, the additional 500 consultants we are currently missing would need to be hired as well as another 2,500 thereafter.  If the Government is ambitious about our healthcare system, it must admit that the shortfall is approximately 3,000 consultants rather than 500.  Given that we have approximately 3,000 hospital consultants, the Government needs to double the current number to get to the European average.  We should probably be a bit more ambitious for our country and for our people than to be at the European average.<\/p> <p>  Dr. McGarry has given us worrying figures relating to to public health specialists.<\/p><p>Up to half of them are due to retire in the next five years.  We have about half the number of orthopaedic surgeons, paediatricians and psychiatrists we need and 30% of the number of ophthalmologists.  There is a crisis with the shortage of hospital consultants in particular hospitals and specialties.  For particular towns, villages and cities, it is even worse.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses know if there is a plan anywhere in the HSE or the Department that states this is the number of consultants required per hospital, per specialty or per hospital group, or even just for the country, over the next five to ten years?

I am aware that people might say, \"If we just had another consultant's report,\" or that if we just fling another few million euro at one of the big consulting firms, somehow a solution will fall out of the sky.  I share Dr. Sadlier's aspiration to have a fully staffed team in north Dublin, but I do not think it will come via the few million euro spent on a consultant's report.  Sinn F&eacute;in asked about issue this recently in a parliamentary question.  Millions of euro are spent by the Department of Health on reports.  One could line the walls of this place with them.  They possibly could do it to provide extra insulation and it would provide value for the money spent.  Nothing is done.  A Vision for Change is a great strategy, but not if it is not implemented.  I contend that there is a lot of evidence that more implementation plans or another consultant's report are not needed, that what is actually needed is the political will to get on and get the job done.  The first moratorium on recruitment in the health service was brought forward two years ahead of everywhere else in 2007.  We cannot ignore the fact that while the moratorium had a detrimental impact on every Department, for the Department of Health and the HSE the impact was felt two years earlier.  Sometimes this is forgotten when we talk about the overall health spend.  It is a large amount of money, but Dr. Sara Burke, for example, has said we are just plugging a gap and trying to make up for decades of under-investment, with a population increase.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on whether another report might help.  I do not believe it would, but I am open to hearing from the representatives if they think one is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#V01300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I have to agree with the Deputy.

Some of those doctors are qualified and experienced and come from countries where they had difficulties with registration.  That is a legal issue and we will not get into that here.  Some of those doctors are operating in places where they probably need some supervision.  There are local supervision arrangements in place but, at a national level, there is no supervision policy of which I am aware.  The solution to the problem is to reverse the 30% pay cut for new entrants.  That pay cut created this issue.

There has been a suggestion, with which Sinn F&eacute;in agrees, that if the facility to order diagnostic tests is extended to GPs, this will have a positive impact on waiting lists.  It is one thing to extend that facility but it is quite another to ensure the services are available.  Has the Medical Council had discussions with the Department of Health on facilitating GPs to order diagnostic tests directly, which they currently cannot?  Some of the logjam is caused by the fact that patients must be referred to a consultant before they can access diagnostic tests.  In the event that the ability to order such tests is extended to GPs, the services and the physical infrastructure must be in place.  Apart from that, are there other barriers?  Has the Medical Council had any discussions with the HSE on this?

Hence, one gets into this referral system that goes on<i>ad infinitum<\/i>.

I am not sure if that is as a result of my hair going white or if I am missing something.  I have tabled numerous questions to various Ministers about the cost of our health services and the adequacy of the annual budget to meet the requirements throughout the country each year.  I have always been assured that adequate provision has been made but every year, without fail, a Supplementary Estimate has been required to meet the budget overruns.  Two things happen at Estimates time.<\/p><p>Each Department must supply its requirements, whatever they are.  This entails an evaluation of what is being delivered, how it is going to be delivered and how it was delivered last year.  For some unknown reason, we do not seem to be working in the health services.  We do not seem to be connecting.  This year will have the lowest overrun in several years by the end of the year but I remember having the same problem when I was on the health board.  We had the same problem during the boom.  We have had a continuous problem.  Nobody can tell me what the actual requirement in the delivery of health services is in financial terms.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to the operation of the delivery of the services.  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme was supposed to do that.  That is the prototype and we have been told that it will deliver.  The witnesses' colleagues appeared before us last week.  Their opening statement was that politics should be taken out of the health service.  Mind you, they were quite political themselves when they elucidated further and there will be another debate on that as well.  I asked a question and was not given an answer.  What is the cost of delivering?  What more is required in terms of budget?  Is it &euro;5 billion, &euro;10 billion or 30% of the existing budget?  It would appear to be that.  If it is 30% of the existing budget, I am afraid we are in the wrong place because the HSE appeared before us some time ago and told us that with regard to all appointments of consultants, GPs and specialists of all descriptions, it must compete with New York, London and Sydney.  New York, London and Sydney have not been through the kind of economic crash we have been through by a long shot.<\/p><p> The question arises as to what we do.  Can the witnesses tell us, based on their involvement inside the system, what percentage of an increase in the health budget is required and to whom do we give it to get delivery of the services that are now required?  We have an increased population but that is not the only problem.  We have an increased number of taxpayers as well.  We also have an increased number of young people.  The ageing cohort is referred to all the time as being the reason for the problems we have.  This is not entirely accurate for the simple reason that a significant number of people who have come into this country in the past five years are young people so it is not all tilting towards the elderly.  This is balanced by a young population.  Based on their knowledge of the system, can the witnesses quantify what is needed?  Reference has been made by my colleague to OECD countries and charges levelled at us at all times, and we are only members of this committee, to the effect that we are the third or fourth highest spender on health in the OECD so what is going wrong?<\/p><p> During the boom, things were better, although I am not sure, but the country was broke.  We can very easily go back to that spot and it could happen overnight because trends can emerge very quickly, the budgetary situation can go wrong overnight and we are back to square one and will do the same thing again in ten years time because there will be more cuts.  We all hear the witnesses with regard to what happened in 2012.  The alternative was not going to be nice.  Everybody everywhere would have been let go.  There was no money to pay anybody.  Pensions and all the rest of it would have been cut.  There were cuts at that time that were harsh.  I assure the witnesses from a Government perspective that these cuts were very difficult to sell but they were the lesser of two evils because the alternative was everything collapsing in which case we would not be here at all.  What is required to be spent to deliver a comprehensive health service?  Could the witnesses tell us whether they think we should have to compete with New York, London, Boston and Sydney for consultants?  I have a follow-up question.

I will address his question about the cuts to salaries in 2012.  The Deputy is right.  We were in a financial crisis but we imposed a 30% cut on new entrants.  The day that was introduced, it saved zero money for the country because there were no new entrants.  Within the first year, it saved a tiny amount of money because savings are only made when people are appointed.  The argument that this cut did anything to help the financial status of the country at the time of the crisis does not make sense because it was imposed on staff who had not even started working in the service.  Agency fees are way beyond what we would pay if we just paid the doctors the salaries that were agreed.<\/p> <p>  I go back to my experience of working in the health service.  The Hanly report was published within a year of two of my graduation.  Ultimately, the question of how much the health service will cost to run is a political one because it depends on what sort of health service we want.  Do we want small hospitals around the country or do we want all the hospitals to be in one big city?  The Hanly report spoke about cost savings and economies of scale of moving to large centres.  The question arises as to what sort of health service one wants from a political perspective.  One must then cost how much it will cost to deliver that health service.  We keep making comparisons with other European countries but they run their health services very differently.  One could argue, probably correctly, that certain European countries have very urbanised populations, do not have the low population density we have on the west coast, can run larger hospitals and have economies of scale.  However, ultimately, once we have worked out what sort of health service we want to deliver, we must then work out the cost of delivering that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>With regard to what Dr. Sadlier highlighted, namely, the type of health service we want, by and large, the vast majority of the costs in general practice are taken up by GPs so if we say that we will have a general practice service that is fully funded by the State, the actual amount required is exponentially more than what is currently there.

Would it be of any benefit if they stayed for a specified period?  I do not know.<\/p> <p>  Those delivering at the coalface in the health services should be able to give us some indication as to how much money is required to provide the service.  This is notwithstanding the fact that, before and during the boom, we had waiting lists and we still have them.  The witnesses say they are growing but if we are exporting our medical professionals, they are going to grow.<\/p> <p>  Incidentally, the way we operate, there are backlogs everywhere and waiting lists for almost everything.  This has been the case for years and we have become accustomed to it.  That is the culture.  It is a misleading culture and it is damaging to the system, in particular to confidence in the system.  We start off with long waiting lists of hundreds or thousands.  When do we expect to overhaul them?  It can never happen unless we have a doubling of the expenditure on health for X number of years.  Do the witnesses think that is possible?  I do not think it is. <\/p> <p>  To return to the first point, the population is aging but people are now working longer than they ever did before, and they have to do that because of changes in legislation, which were necessary.  However, everybody avoids the cohort of new people who have come into the country, of whom there are a very large number.  I am sure they are as healthy as the now aging population were when they were younger.  Therefore, there is a missing part to the explanation and we are not getting it.  I do not know if the witnesses are in a position to be able to give us that information.  However, if we are talking about a 30% increase in the health budget, we are talking about &euro;5 billion in a year.  I do not think that kind of thing is going to happen, or not easily and not quickly, so we have to find another method.  We are still stuck with the allegation that we are paying more for the service than most other OECD countries. <\/p> <p>  There are places in Australia - the outback, for example - where it is fairly expensive to deliver services over vast areas of territory but people get a service, and it is the same in parts of the United States and in Canada, which are massive countries.  This economic notion that has been brought forward over the years, that we will build bigger hospitals in high population locations and will forget about the rest, does not stand up anywhere else except in this country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#Y00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>There are a number of points and I will address two of them.

Nobody has ever won a Nobel prize in medicine for research done in Ireland.  We will always be dependent on a certain cohort of doctors going abroad to learn new skills and new innovations because we are not a country that produces new innovations in surgical techniques or medical techniques, largely due to our size.

We have suggested for those groupings which have taken on board such loans to get through medicine, and who enter into general practice, that perhaps some sort of tax rebate could be considered because they would then stay in the country, earn money in the country and provide the service.

I hope the witnesses' replies will not be too negative or the students might find they have to leave the country because we are getting too negative here about a lot of things.<\/p> <p>  I want to refer to Medical Council figures.  I am intrigued by how we are commenting on medical practitioners in this country.  My reading of the Medical Council figures is that, five years ago, there were 19,046 medical practitioners on the Medical Council register, and the latest figures for 2018 show there are 22,996, which is a 20.72% increase.  I am intrigued because all of the media focus seems to be about the shortage of doctors yet there has been a 20% increase in the number working here, or who are on the medical register, most of whom I presume are working here.  For instance, the number of junior doctors has increased quite substantially in the hospitals because of the working time directive but no one is talking about that.  Much of what is being said is very negative and one negative creates a second negative.  I am concerned about the negativity in regard to recruitment.  I accept there are issues in regard to some of the doctors coming in, such as those relating to their previous training and experience, which I fully understand.<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to consultants.  I would like clarification on the number of consultant posts five years ago and the number now.  Taking the number of consultant posts now, how many are occupied permanently and how many are occupied by agency or locum consultants?<\/p><p>My understanding is that five years ago, approximately 2,500 permanent consultants were working in the system but that number is now approximately 3,000 while another 500 posts remain unfilled.<\/p><p> We can go back 20 years regarding recruitment as there was a system in place where a consultant was reaching the age of 64 or 65.  It was flagged within the hospital system that it needed to plan to replace that person, organise advertising and ensure somebody would be committed to taking up the job when the consultant retired.  That all seems to have collapsed as the process was absorbed into the HSE.  It is astonishing that positions after being advertised after a person has retired.  This relates to agency and locum staff as the people who have retired may have to come back to act as a locum.  Has the IMO approached the HSE about fast-tracking the process and planning?  There is a lack of planning within the HSE with respect to the recruitment of consultants, which is adding to the overall problem.<\/p><p> Agency and locum staff cost three times as much as employing someone on a contract.  I disagreed at the time with the 30% reduction that has been mentioned.  I did a report in 2012 about graduates from that year.  We interviewed them across all universities.  A total of 60% indicated that they would leave Ireland within 12 months once the intern year was done.  That report was done in addition to a report by the health committee but I am astonished there was no take-up on it by the HSE with respect to forward planning.<\/p><p> Retaining junior doctors is a major issue.  Allowances were cut back so what has been restored?  This is not about salary or anything else but rather simple elements such as days allowed for study.  How much progress has been made in restoring what they had previously?  What more could we be doing to make it attractive for junior doctors to stay here?  We are not doing enough about that and the HSE's approach is not correct either.  The approach from certain elements of HSE management is to tolerate junior doctors but if the position was made more attractive than in other jurisdictions through the provision of allowances and study leave, we would have a greater chance of retaining them in the system.  What simple measures could be taken?  There would not be a major cost.  There are more than 6,000 junior doctors in the hospital system and many of them want to study in various other areas.<\/p><p> I raised a matter with the Medical Council last week about doctors dropping out of the system and I was a bit taken aback by the response.  I was speaking to a medical practitioner recently about two people doing obstetrics and gynaecology.  One had done nine years of training and the other had done six years.  They have now dropped out and returned to GP training.  I am not saying the GP system is easier but there is not the same level of stress.  We discussed adverse events and the lack of support within the hospital system for doctors and nursing staff.  I have heard about nursing staff facing an inquest without being given any support before or after the hearing.  It is not that anybody did something wrong but that the experience is traumatic.<\/p><p> There are 135,000 people working for the HSE and the number of whole-time equivalents has increased across the board, including nurses, doctors, administration and management.  I have a major issue with administration and management.  That means an additional 16,000 whole-time equivalents are working in the HSE compared to December 2014, which is a 17% increase.  I am surprised by the lack of challenge from the medical organisations to the disproportionate increase in administration and management compared with medical practitioners and nursing staff.  I had to extract this information over a period.  I am very much ploughing a lone furrow on this.  There was a 24% increase in administration and management but an 11% increase in front-line nursing staff.  I am a bit concerned as we need to have a bit more joined-up thinking across the board but there must be a challenge from within the system as well as outside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#Y00700","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>There are at least six questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#Z00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I was going to commend the committee on the new format where there is a question and answer but we seem to have slipped back to multiple questions.

On the added value of an agency locum, I do not want to be disrespectful to my colleagues.  There is a value in having agency doctors who, on the whole, are very well trained and very well qualified medical practitioners.  It is better to have a doctor in the post than not have one in the post but I have experience of a service where we have not been able to fill a post permanently for a number of years.  Somebody will come in on a three-month contract but they cannot work beyond that because they have other commitments elsewhere.  It is very difficult, therefore, to plan whether to book patients for the three months following that contract.  We then get a backlog of referrals which are put to the side.  If we manage to get the post filled, those patients go on the waiting list and so on.  It is absolutely the case that the uncertainty in terms of being able to plan and run the service leads to a backlog in the waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  Specifically in psychiatry, where we may have community psychiatry departments with one or perhaps two consultants covering a small area, if there is a gap or absence in that area referrals become completely backlogged.  We have seen that in child psychiatry services across the country, specifically outside the major urban areas.  There are waiting lists in the major urban areas also but we have major problems with waiting lists outside those areas.  They are services that had a small number of practitioners and if one is missing out of a team of three, the service is down by 33% but if one is missing out of a team of one, there is a 100% deficit.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of inefficiencies, I have said in this room on more than one occasion that it is to do with electronic patient records.  If the Chairman asked me during the Sl&aacute;intecare hearings or hearings on whatever the report was before Sl&aacute;intecare, as a person working on the ground, the biggest difference that could be made to the Irish healthcare service, it is not Sl&aacute;intecare or any of that.  It is whether we can have an information management system that is not based in the 1990s.  One could walk into an Irish hospital in 1890 and walk into one now and one would have the same information management system.  Our outpatients records are paper-based.  We receive letters, names have to be written into a diary, which is transcribed into another diary.  One of the reasons for the delay when a patient comes into the emergency department is because it takes six hours to get that patient's charts from medical records.  I work in north Dublin.  For various reasons, people might go to Connolly hospital or might end up in the emergency department in the Mater hospital and to get their records from one hospital to the other we would need to hire the Secret Service.  From my perspective, if there was anything that could be done to improve the efficiency of the medical service in this country it would be to have a proper information management system.  That would definitely improve the efficiency of our service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#AA01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I have a comment on the electronic records.

The first aspect concerns the vacant consultant posts.  Most college rules state that a trainer needs to be a permanent consultant.  Consultants who are rotating might be there for the duration of training, but equally they might not.  Extra supports are also needed for such posts, however.  The problem is that our service is struggling to survive; it is running to keep up.  The problem with a training post is that it requires a doctor to be engaged in non-service provision for a certain percentage of his or her week.  That is especially the case in the higher specialist training, where the percentage might be as high as 20% to 30% of the week.  That is a luxury that cannot be afforded when there are huge waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  All of this comes back to three major aspects.  I refer to this being a numbers game, the difficulty with the recruitment of consultants and trainers and, as I mentioned at the start, the ongoing difficulty of Ireland's rapidly increasing population.  That accounts for many of our problems in general.  Some 64,000 people were added to the population last year and it will be similar next year.  Our population has increased by 50% in just over 20 years.  That is a great thing, but there is a requirement for the provision of the requisite extra infrastructure and services.  The situation at the moment means that we can set our target figures for this year, but they will have shifted by the time of delivery.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I have to be fair to everybody, so I have to move on to Deputy O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#CC00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I was going to expand on the three things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#CC00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Dr. McGarry might work his answers into his responses to the questions from Deputy O'Reilly and she might address a question to Dr. McGarry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#CC00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I will.

One of the absolutely necessary things mentioned is the advent of chronic disease management being brought into general practice.  That is a more appropriate location and that is where one of the major roles for practice nurses will be, given the present set-up in those general practices.  Many things can happen and it should never be carved in stone that someone does the same thing <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  If it is possible for some people to do different things, then so be it.  It may be that an administrative assistant could be trained up to do various things such as phlebotomies, ECGs, etc.  That would allow the practice nurse greater availability.  I am not adverse to that idea at all.  Provision has been made for more practice nurses in the context of chronic disease management.  It has yet to be decided how that will be implemented.  The intention exists, however, and it should be expanded.  For the first time, the plan for chronic disease management sets in place the requirement that any additional work needs to be resourced.  That has to be expanded upon.  The other thing that needs to be done for general practice is the addressing of the inequity of the out-of-hours arrangements around the country.  That needs to be addressed urgently.  The Department commissioned its own report on this matter about two years ago, but it has never been released and nothing has happened.

The first and primary impact concerns junior doctors.  A person coming out of medical school, after finishing his or her internship, may look at Irish consultant posts and think those are unattractive.  That person is then almost forced to emigrate in order that he or she can plug into the training system of another country and be in line to get a permanent post there.  One of the knock-on effects of the pay cut, therefore, was the emigration of doctors at the start of their careers.  That was because taking up permanent consultancy posts in other countries may require extra exams and qualifications in that country.  It depends on the location, but there can be slight differences in training and speciality.

There was a view that a particular type of person was suited to the role and would be committed to it.<\/p><p>We also had the district hospital doctor, who was perhaps the second or third generation working in the same hospital and taking personal pride in his own patch.  I believe that has shifted now and it is more of a job.  The same thing happened in the local authorities, an area we know well, where the county manager was a permanent fixture.  The manager took full responsibility and pride in delivering to what he or she saw as his or her patch.  That is gone now because it is now a contract.  The same pride is not carried with it because it is a job.  It is a route towards promotion somewhere else.  I am not suggesting that I know more about this than the IMO representatives, but I am deeply concerned about it.  In medicine in particular there is a need to have that unique vocational commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#CC01500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Three questions were put relating to the number of hospital beds, the vocation of medicine and finally the pride in the job, continuity of employment and continuity giving a better quality of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#DD00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I am a general practitioner - I have been a GP for over 30 years.

The population is expanding so our need for beds is expanding.<\/p> <p>  I wish to come back to the core issue about vocation.  I would not consider myself old but there has been considerable change from the time I graduated in 1999 to now.  If a person had a stroke and came into a hospital 20 years ago, when I graduated, things were different compared to now.  The possibilities now include thrombolysis or trying to melt the clot and restore the blood supply to the affected part of the brain so that the patient has a limited deficit from the stroke.  If a person had a heart attack when I qualified the management of those procedures was markedly different.  In the first days, it was pain relief and then into cardiac care and hope for the best.  Nowadays, a patient can have angioplasty or have the clot removed.  The damage to a patient's heart muscle can be minimised.<\/p> <p>  I am unsure whether the county manager job in the past 20 years has moved with the technical changes we have seen in medicine during the past 20 years.  That has led to a difference.  I agree 100% that this has had to lead to a difference in how doctors work.  We have had to become a little more specialised.  We have had to become more specialised towards individual skills and procedures.  If I was a patient and had someone sticking a needle into my groin that would go all the way into one of the arteries in my heart, I certainly would want someone who was doing that procedure every day of the week, and not a general county physician who was doing it every third Tuesday.  The difference in medicine in recent years has been phenomenal in terms of the benefits we can give to patients.  The treatment survival rates in cancer care, cardiovascular disease and stroke have been phenomenal.  We want everyone in the country to benefit from those technical changes.  They should be available not based on where a person lives but available to everyone in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019101600002#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Sadlier.

In recent years, because of the way general practice has been allowed to come under threat there has been a vacuum.  Corporates have come in and filled that vacuum.  There is a serious danger with that type of model.  Whereas it serves a purpose, it certainly will not go across the board.

Children of garda&iacute; become garda&iacute;, children of publicans become publicans and children of farmers become farmers.  Children of doctors tend to understand what is involved, especially in general practice.  This is because, by and large, the practice is in the house so the family know what is involved.  That was certainly the case in my house.  Then, when someone from the next generation goes into it, he understands what is involved and has bought into it.  It becomes part of the DNA.

I am chief executive officer of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and I am joined by my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, who is our spokesperson on housing.  Founded in 1839, the RIAI has 3,900 members and is the support and registration body for architects in Ireland and the membership and support body for architectural technologists.  Our mission is to drive excellence in architecture and the built environment, with a focus on developing policy and contributing to legislation that supports a better built environment.  The RIAI works to ensure the safety of the public through the efficient and effective administration of the register of architects and the maintenance of standards within architectural education.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI welcomes the establishment of the Land Development Agency, LDA, as a key pillar in the delivery of the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040.  The challenges we face as a country, including climate change, a growing population, an ageing demographic and new patterns of work, leisure and retail, mean we need new strategies and vehicles to deliver a coherent and high-quality built environment.  With the country facing so many critical challenges and having a number of great opportunities, we must now make decisions based on national long-term need.  The LDA provides an opportunity to develop sites that meet the national need and move on from the inter-county, intercity and inter-parish debates that so frequently dominate discussions about where and what we build.<\/p> <p>  We need a coherent, ambitious plan for State-owned lands that focuses on delivering quality and helps to bring stability to the unpredictable housing market.  The LDA gives the State the opportunity to drive this change and to lead in delivering a new type of housing that supports quality and innovation.  However, we cannot build housing in isolation.  The development of each landbank will require an informed study of existing and required infrastructure, the present condition of the site and a well-developed design strategy.  The institute recommends that such studies are undertaken prior to the sale of any public landbanks.  In the short-term, a pilot scheme should be funded to examine the optimum housing mix potential for each site to ensure that the homes, infrastructure and public realm that are developed are suitable for the people who will live there.  There is scope for developing housing schemes based on a multi-generational approach, so that the needs of different cohorts of people, including students, young families and older people, can be met on an integrated basis on the same site.  This will help to foster a sense of community in new housing developments and encourage private investment in amenities that match the requirements for everyone living there.<\/p> <p>  The procurement processes the LDA uses to identify architectural and other built environment professionals must focus on long-term quality and provide a clear pipeline of the work to be commissioned.  The agency might consider the principles set out in the RIAI's publication, A Guide to Smart Public Procurement, which provides for a procurement model focused on quality outcomes and ensures that businesses of a range of scales and locations are eligible to tender for works.  The RIAI strongly recommends the use of architectural design competitions as an integral part of the LDA's procurement processes to ensure the development of quality architecture.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI welcomes the draft legislation the committee is examining today, but we do have several observations to make.  The objectives of the LDA set out under head 8 are comprehensive.  However, we recommend that object 2(c), which concerns the aim of achieving a positive financial return for the State, be interpreted as broadly as possible.  The financial return might include stimulation of the development of the wider area, which will bring long-term State benefit.<\/p> <p>  The functions for the LDA set out under head 9 are likewise comprehensive.  Again, we propose that object 3(a), which deals with the establishment and maintenance of a register of relevant public lands, be broadly interpreted.  A central register of all publicly owned lands is required to allow for informed decision-making at national level.<\/p><p>In defining the role for the LDA in the proposed legislation, the State should consider developing protocols to enable any uplift in the value of public or private landholdings consequent to rezoning to be either fully allocated to the State or equitably allocated between the State and any private owner affected by rezoning.  The uplift in land value may then be used for the public good through infrastructure, public realm development, community development, amenity development and other sustainable developments. Precedents for this approach exist in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and Germany.<\/p><p> To deliver on its functions successfully, it is important that all of the LDA's powers and resources be made available.  The LDA requires sufficient staffing and resources to unlock the potential of sites for new housing.  As has occurred with legislation other than the LDA legislation, the intent and ambition are detailed but the tools to deliver are not followed through. To be a success, this cannot be allowed to happen with the LDA.<\/p><p> The choices available to us as to how we develop as a country are reducing.  We must take a long-term, holistic view of how and where we deliver our housing and built infrastructure.  We must meet new improved standards of building and deliver new models of increased density to ensure the damage to the planet and our impact on climate change are reversed.<\/p><p> The RIAI welcomes the initiative to establish the Land Development Agency and asks that the legislation be progressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Meghen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to give evidence on this important topic.  I am the director general of Engineers Ireland.  I am accompanied by Dr. Kieran Feighan, a past president of Engineers Ireland and a chartered engineer.  He is joining me in representing our institution at this morning's meeting.<\/p> <p>  Engineers Ireland is one of the oldest and largest representative bodies on the island, with more than 25,000 members.  This membership incorporates all disciplines of engineering, including consulting and contracting organisations, the public sector, semi-State bodies and educational institutions.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, we published The State of Ireland 2019: A review of housing and infrastructure in Ireland, copies of which I have with me.  The report's findings are based on the deliberations of an advisory group of engineers and other housing professionals from the public and private sectors.  At the launch of the report, we were pleased to get the perspectives of many stakeholders and we hosted a panel discussion that included Mr. John Moran, chairman of the LDA.  The report covers five core housing issues, the first of which is \"land and supporting infrastructure\".  We note that urban land redevelopment offers major potential to meet housing demand and to rejuvenate areas of our towns and cities.  The State is a significant landowner and should play an active and transformative role in land management.<\/p> <p>  In this context, there was very strong support among our expert advisory group for the establishment of the LDA.  Indeed, one of our key recommendations in our report is to, \"Actively manage public land, ensuring the Land Development Agency has a strong mandate and sufficient capacity to coordinate the development of State lands and to assemble strategic land banks from a mixture of public and private lands.\"  Engineers Ireland therefore welcomes the general scheme of the Land Development Agency Bill 2019, which establishes the LDA on a primary legislative basis.  We have five recommendations for the Bill, generally relating to head 8, covering the objectives of the LDA, and head 9, covering the functions of the LDA.  I will outline each recommendation briefly.<\/p> <p>  The first recommendation is on clarity on institutional relationships.  There are many State and Semi-state organisations involved in or related to land development activities.  Indeed, the complexity of the interactions between the landholdings of these bodies partially gave rise to the LDA.  Much greater clarity is needed in regard to the hierarchy of objectives, powers and compellability that will govern the interactions of the LDA with a range of State, semi-State and local authority bodies.  These include existing local authority functions in planning and land disposal, the potential functions and powers of directly elected mayors, and the statutory role of the National Transport Authority in regard to the integration of transport and land use planning in the greater Dublin area and nationally.<\/p> <p>  Second, on a co-ordinated approach to infrastructure development, the LDA has major potential to embrace a cross-departmental approach to land management and development.  A key constraint to land development and housing construction, however, is the availability and capacity of infrastructure, for example, transport, electricity and water infrastructure.  Currently, there is a clear lack of co-ordination in the planning and delivery of infrastructure, with responsibility shared across many bodies.  Engineers Ireland has consistently called for a single infrastructure unit, or national infrastructure commission, for the prioritisation, procurement and co-ordination of all key public infrastructure projects.<\/p> <p>  Third, on compulsory purchase orders, we strongly support the view that the LDA should have sufficient powers to carry out its mandate efficiently and effectively, and we believe these powers should include the power to purchase land compulsorily.  Even if these powers are used infrequently, they send an appropriate signal to the market.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, on having an explicit focus on developing sustainable communities and quality homes, the general scheme of the Bill contains references to supporting the implementation of the national planning framework and having regard to the policy of the Government on proper planning and sustainable development.  These references do not go far enough.  We are in a climate emergency.  Developing sustainable communities must be a fundamental objective of the LDA, added to what is in head 8, subhead 2.  For example, LDA-developed communities should have excellent public transport links, highly energy-efficient housing and recreational amenities, and they should promote biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  Fifth, with regard to resources and professional competence, the LDA should directly employ qualified professional construction specialists, including chartered engineers, so that it has the in-house skills and expertise to manage the buildings, infrastructure and land assets, and liabilities of those assets, on its register.  These competences will enable the LDA to maximise potential for sustainable housing development, but also the strong element of asset management that could be crucial in fulfilling its objectives.  Furthermore, if the LDA is to provide professional services to relevant public bodies, as stated in the general scheme, these competences will be crucial.<\/p> <p>  The potential for the work of the LDA to transform Ireland's approach to land management should not be underestimated.  However, the LDA must have a strong legislative mandate and should be well governed and adequately resourced with funding and expertise to grasp fully these opportunities for environmental, social and economic transformation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Spillane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I am director of policy and corporate services at the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and Ms &Aacute;ine Myler is a chartered valuation surveyor.  Our professional membership is involved in the full life cycle of the built environment, from site planning and development to construction, sale and occupation management.  Our members, comprising nearly 5,000 professionals throughout the country, are employed in private, public, not-for-profit and academic institutions.<\/p> <p>  The society has long supported the creation of a body with a remit to unlock the potential of State-owned lands to address Ireland's current and long-term housing and infrastructural needs.  Developing a body to utilise State assets effectively and efficiently in a way that fosters long-term strategic benefits for society warrants universal support.  It is evident that Ireland faces significant global and domestic short and long-term challenges, from global warming to the housing crisis, in delivering on the goals of Project Ireland.  Therefore, a single body tasked with implementing and contributing to the strategic vision would represent a positive step.  The society believes that the objectives outlined in Part 2, under head 8, need to be better aligned with the strategic objectives for the body, similar to the general objectives of the Dublin Transport Authority, which has become the National Transport Authority.<\/p> <p>  One of the core responsibilities and objectives of the LDA is to unlock key public assets, and indeed private assets, to serve society.  Housing and homelessness comprise one of the most significant issues that I hope will be addressed with the help of the LDA.  This should be recognised under head 8.  We feel that the land cost component has yet to be grasped in public policy in the overall housing delivery program.  Now that we are in a property price stabilisation environment, particularly in Dublin, the land cost component still represents 30% to 50% of the overall delivery cost of new housing.  We feel this is too high.<\/p> <p>  The availability and affordability of serviced land is a significant contributor to the overall affordability of apartments in urban centres.  There is high competition for well-located, zoned and serviced land.  Given the high demand for this type of asset, many developers will take a long-term approach in terms of capital appreciation and therefore may be prepared to pay high prices for land.  The cost breakdowns in our reports show the site purchase cost per apartment unit ranged from &euro;33,000, for a suburban low-density development, to &euro;125,000, for a high-density urban development.<\/p><p>Our study found that one site, the first, is affordable for the average income while the other one is not.  This is a significant range with a huge impact on viability and affordability, which should be reflected in the objects of the Bill.<\/p><p> The relationship and collaboration between key partners and the LDA are essential to prevent mistakes in poor planning, short-term gains and costly errors regarding the provision of services.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, in its report, stated that, \"Effective active land management involves public authorities working with a range of private and non-for-profit development and housing organisations.\"  A key component of this relationship will be planning.  The society sees the usefulness of strategic development zones not only to provide planning clarity but also shared vision and speed of implementation for the LDA, local authorities and their private partners.  It will be useful for the LDA to engage in these policies and this should be reflected in the Bill.<\/p><p> Looking longer term, the acquiring of private land in conjunction with these partners will be an important role for the LDA.  The society has contributed to the Law Reform Commission's review of this aspect of land law and believes that action on those findings will be a prerequisite to the achievement of the objectives of the Land Development Agency as well as Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p> The society welcomes the conclusion, under head 9(2)(h), which will allow the LDA to provide a more fundamental area of support to public bodies.  There is a clear need to develop public sector expertise in the area of property and construction.  Building this capacity within the public sector is much needed to ensure the public as a client has the best advice that it can get when negotiating with private partners.<\/p><p> The society has been encouraged by progress on its long-standing recommendation for mapping of all State-owned land.  The LDA's work with Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, Departments and agencies has demonstrated the importance of removing silos and adopting a holistic approach to State-owned lands and their potential uses.  Any strategic review requires a complete survey of assets.  From this point, it is then possible to plan and measure the impact of their use to maximise the efficiency and productivity of State-owned land.  Therefore, we welcome head 9(3)(a) to \"establish and maintain a register of relevant public lands\" to implement the national planning framework.  The society suggests that, in the interests of transparency and good governance, this is maintained as a public register.<\/p><p> It is often said that we tend to overestimate the impact of change in the short term but underestimate the effect in the long term.  The society welcomes the creation of the Land Development Agency and believes that, with an ambitious remit under head 8 and a robust approach to governance as part of head 9, as well as the supporting policies being put in place by the Legislature, it can achieve long-term strategy benefit for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. King.

I sit as the housing director representing the federation and the Irish Home Builders Association.  I am joined by Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Neill, vice-chairman of the Irish Home Builders Association, today.<\/p> <p>  Most commentators agree that Ireland needs an annual housing output of between 25,000 and 45,000 homes.  This year, the CIF expects output to reach approximately 22,000.  Of these, up to 40% could be one-off homes outside the parameters in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>  The CIF welcomes the Land Development Agency and acknowledges it has a significant part to play in ensuring the correct level of social and affordable housing for the State is delivered.  It also has a role to enable development in regions, towns and communities identified as key in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>  If the LDA is calibrated correctly, it could become another part of an effective suite of measures, including Home Building Finance Ireland, the local infrastructure housing activation fund and the help-to-buy scheme that are starting to address the market failure in finance in home building.  It could play a major role in addressing several affordability gaps stymieing efforts to increase supply currently.<\/p> <p>  Our analysis has identified a significant affordability gap for young couples.  At the current average house prices, a couple earning under &euro;93,000 combined will have to save for four years, even with the help-to-buy scheme, to save a deposit for the average Dublin home.  A couple in Meath or Kildare would have to save for 15 years.  This affordability gap is consigning couples to rental purgatory, and we are suggesting that the Government adopt a shared equity scheme, similar to that in operation in the UK, to help bridge this affordability gap.  The CIF believes that this affordability gap will only expand over the coming years as construction costs increase, demand remains tight and regulation continues to increase the cost of home building.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, a functioning market requires people who can purchase, builders who can build and banks that can lend.  Where prices are below the cost of construction, builders cannot secure finance to build, meaning potential purchasers are excluded from the market. This is the reason home building outside the greater Dublin area, GDA, has remained depressed.  The LDA has the potential to license State lands to home builders in these areas, essentially removing land prices from construction costs.  In this case, the Land Development Agency is intervening in areas where house building is restricted by the current financial model.  This is an essential role, in the context of Project Ireland 2040, where cities, towns and communities outside the greater Dublin area must grow at twice the rate of the capital over the next 25 years.<\/p> <p>  The CIF is downgrading its estimates for housing completions in 2019 to just under 22,000.  Social and affordable new builds are likely, due to the market dynamics, to be only a fraction of this output, with viability and availability of infrastructure key constraints in this.<\/p> <p>  The industry believes that the LDA is best placed to enable the delivery of social and affordable housing by license where it is simply not viable for home builders to secure finance to deliver units.  In addition, if the LDA identifies the correct State lands for development, it would result in increasing the development potential for adjacent lands owned by home builders that are currently unviable.  For example, connecting a State-owned site to infrastructure and utilities could conceivably mean other surrounding sites would then also become viable for development.  This will require transparent and effective collaboration between national and local government and the private sector.  This blended approach will prevent a counterproductive situation whereby the LDA effectively replaces the SME home builder while only marginally increasing the level of housing output.  The principle of additionality should be applied in consideration of the selection of State lands to develop.<\/p> <p>  It is critical for a fully functioning market that the LDA provides full transparency in terms of the landbanks being prioritised for development, and with timescales.  An approach similar to the Government's national development plan infrastructure tracker could be adopted for the LDA's portfolio, where a clear pipeline of projects has been identified and updated in real time.  The agency will also require, in our opinion, greater powers to obtain critical State lands in a speedy manner to begin developments as soon as possible in the face of increasing construction, land and labour costs that can erode value where developments are delayed.<\/p> <p>  As specialists in the area and the market, home builders and developers are well placed to provide advice to the LDA on development issues, typologies and timeframes, and as such should partner with the agency.  As part of this process, we believe that the LDA should only issue performance specifications as to what is required for tender to developers.  This will allow developers apply their expertise within the regulatory regime to deliver quality homes.  We would suggest the LDA also completes preparatory work for site pre-development for maximum efficiency.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the SME home building sector has undergone a traumatic decade.  The LDA should ensure that its qualification requirements do not effectively exclude SMEs from securing licences in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Benson.

There are many good suggestions in terms of amendments that some of us are considering for the legislation.<\/p> <p>  They probably know, if they paid attention to the previous hearings, or they will get a clear sense from the discussion today, that we are in a bit of a dilemma in this committee.  We all want the Land Development Agency and we all want it do many of the things they outlined, but we will get one crack at this legislation.  We have many concerns, although we do not have the full detail of the proposed Bill, with the direction the proposed Bill is going in.  The witnesses should not take any of my questions or comments as opposition to the principle of what we are dealing with here but more the substance in front of us.  My questions are for all four organisations.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, a big bit of this is not only the management of land but, as was stated in one of the presentations, the land cost component, and the issue of land value capture and land value extraction.  It is one of the thorniest issues that we must try and deal with.  I would like their thoughts on how the LDA can best deal with land costs, in terms of trying to depress or moderate them but also ensure that the public gets the best outcome in terms of the value extraction from it.<\/p><p>There are some general comments there but we are very keen to hear more about whether the Land Development Agency, LDA, is in the business of acquiring and developing out land, and in practical terms how it can best deal with those issues of moderating land prices and ensuring the public captures the value.<\/p><p> One of the big concerns some of us have is that while the LDA is currently constituted as a non-commercial semi-State body, this legislation would turn it into an independent commercial designated activities company, DAC.  This provides the potential for a very clear conflict of interest between its requirement to get a commercial return and the social and environmental objectives that have been outlined by pretty much everyone here.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether or not an independent commercial DAC is the right vehicle for that? <\/p><p> Climate change was referred to in a number of the presentations.  Clearly, if we are to meet those climate change challenges if there is a question over commercial return versus long-term climate responsibilities where would the balance lie and what is the best way to try to tackle that?<\/p><p> All the representatives' organisations have spoken to us before, and some of them have done very important research, including that done by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, around affordability, viability and development costs.  The committee had very interesting conversations yesterday around the affordable housing component of what the LDA does, and whether its delivery model is a cost model or a discount from market value model.  Do the witnesses have views and thoughts on that?  For example, what we are seeing at O'Devaney Gardens, because they are applying the market value at a discount, is still working out very expensive for the taxpayer and the purchaser.  Where does the balance of that lie?<\/p><p> I have three further questions.  With regard to compulsory purchase order powers we are hearing from the Department that it may bring CPO powers into the Bill at a later stage, but that it would be for ransom strips of land that are small pieces of land needed to resolve access issues, rather than for fuller powers.  What are the witnesses views on that?  Can the LDA do its cost component work if it does not have broader CPO powers?<\/p><p> Although the 10% social and 30% affordable ratio is a minimum, clearly if the LDA is to remain off balance sheet it would become the norm.  Given the enormous housing crisis, and especially in affordable housing, do the representatives have a view on whether that should be a higher portion?  The proposed legislation does not even mention the delivery of social housing and affordable housing, which are not mentioned explicitly in the aims and objectives under headings 8 or 9.<\/p><p> In Dublin city especially we are noticing that public housing projects tender prices are coming in at very high levels.  They are way above the increases in costs of construction.  We are aware of where construction cost inflation is going.  We are seeing astronomical prices coming in for projects where there is no land costs and all sorts of other development costs that are not factored in.  How do we, in the context of the LDA, ensure that it does not become victim to a very small number of competitors in the marketplace?  Is it about breaking the lots up?  Is it about reforming the procurement and tendering process?  Even if we get the LDA right, if a tender goes out then ultimately prices will be set by the market.  There are only four or five big players who can do big development projects.  Many of the smaller and medium sized members of the Construction Industry Federation would be squeezed out.  How do we get them in to maximise the competition and bring down the price?<\/p><p> I apologise but I must leave for another engagement at 10.30 a.m but I will follow everything up in the transcript if I do not get back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#D00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

I will cover some of the elements of the questions in reverse order.  The Deputy referred to prices and the costs in the construction industry.  At the outset one can see that the land price is a major issue in that regard.  Removing that cost would allow for taking away most of the risk, and one could see a reduced profit margin there.  The riskier element being removed so substantially would see a lower margin required by the construction industry.<\/p> <p>  I contend that there is still quite an inflation in labour costs now, which we have not seen in the last ten years.  We have seen increases in the minimum wage rates that were required, and first introduced through the sectoral employment order for the construction sector in 2017.  It resulted in a 15% increase in wage rates.  That is coupled with an increase on 1 October of a further 2.7%, which will increase again next year by a further 2.7%.  That element of costs is continually creeping up.  When we look at the hard costs of a build, to comply with the regulations currently, I estimate that over the past four years there has been an increase in costs of up to &euro;20,000 to comply with such regulations as parts L and F and what is coming down the line for part B and changes to part C.  There are numerous increases involved there.  There is the requirement to deliver a far superior product, which was the case even at the end of the recession around 2011.  Given some of these elements, even if the land costs are taken away, we might see a question around competitive or tender prices on it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to breaking up the lots.  I would agree.  There is huge concern from the bulk of the SME companies that make up the majority of the construction industry, that there would be some sort of mechanism put in place through the LDA for an allotment and for those licences to be broken up so it would not just be whole lots given off, so there would be no disadvantage to the industry.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke of securing a blended mix of tenure within the communities and constituencies.  This will be key to the set up of the agency.  I will now close off from our own side again, which echo the thoughts and concerns of the Deputy around CPO powers.  We addressed that in our opening statement.  There will be a critical need for this to happen in a speedy manner to ensure that developments can happen as soon as possible.  Even looking down from projections, and even with the legislation going through, we could be looking at 2021 before we start to see shovels in the ground and this moving on.  We are looking at needing up to 45,000 units to be delivered by 2024.  This is only a five-year period.  Getting up productivity to that point will be a challenge.  Everything that can be done in a speedy manner to aid that, both fairly and competitively, would be encouraged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Benson.

The very <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre <\/i>for this organisation is the fact that we have not managed our land or taken a long-term view of it.  In my own precessional view I believe we have to take the hit at this point in time in terms of what land values are, extant in the marketplace.  If we take a longer-term vision for the management of our land stock so that we buy cheap and use high, which is an analogy for it, then the land costs are neutralised over the long term.  We are dealing with short, medium and long-term issues now.  There is not much the LDA can do in a market that is hot for land to reduce costs of acquisition.  One would imagine that State agencies, Government bodies and local authorities would want to come together to develop a process whereby any State land that is usable for social and affordable housing will be used for that purpose, whatever the minimum cost is of transfer to the Land Development Agency.<br\/><br\/>Our view of the Land Development Agency is not that it is actually going to go out and build houses itself.  If it is doing its job properly, it will be a strategic organisation that facilitates the market to deliver social and affordable housing, and other forms of development as is held in the general scheme of the Bill.  I take the point made by the Construction Industry Federation that the inclusion of the smaller players around the country is exceptionally important.  We have a couple of really big players, where we could have a monopolistic position in a relatively short period of time if we do not look at bringing in the smaller players.  Getting sites ready, putting in the infrastructure and licensing out the sites are all key components.  This is a strategic piece of what the LDA should be doing.  Other issues such as tax policies can also play into land, as do the constitutional rights of private property holders.  Reference was made by one of the other organisations to sharing any uplift on the rezoning of land.  This is a very useful way that we could develop policy.  It could be the case that the public shares in that uplift and not just the landowners.<br\/><br\/>On the cost model, if we have an organisation that can take a long-term view then our long-term view could be very much cost model based.  It was the sense that many local authorities delivered their social housing over many years.  It was a cost model provision because they could take a long-term view.  That is critically important for our housing provision.<\/p><p> On compulsory purchase orders, I am active in that area as a professional.  CPO powers will be critically important to the agency in order so that it can operate on an effective basis.  That power of compellability, in itself, is a useful tool.  It may not be necessary to use it but it is very important.  However, bigger issues arise regarding the operation of the CPO process.  A root and branch review of the legislation and the arbitration process is needed.  We have already made a significant submission to the Law Reform Commission on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Will Ms Myler send the submission to the committee?

We have also made a submission to the Courts Service on the arbitration process.  We will be happy to share those submissions with the committee.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the idea that there are percentages placed against social and affordable housing.  All housing should be affordable, other than for those who do not need it to be affordable.  That should only be the 10% of people who can write a big cheque.  Affordability is not just financial.  The definition of affordability should be examined by the Land Development Agency, LDA, because it can develop a long-term vision.<\/p> <p>  On tender prices, it is very challenging at this time for procuring agencies to see the detail within tenders and the reason prices are shifting.  The society, and other bodies, have come together with international agencies to develop international construction measurement standards, which the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is looking at.  It is hoped these will help procuring agencies to be able to compare and contrast with other jurisdictions each stage of construction costs in other areas and the reason cost is necessarily a factor in certain parts of a construction project here versus in other jurisdictions.  I am aware that materials, labour and every other cost, as well as regulation, have driven up costs very significantly in the recent past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Feighan and Ms Spillane from Engineers Ireland to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#F00400","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I will address some of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions.  Our professional colleagues have addressed some of them and I am sure the witnesses from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland will have a view also.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's first point about land value extraction and how to moderate or depress prices, there is a relationship between that and his question on compulsory purchase orders.  As we stated in our submission, we are of the strong view that the authorities should have the power to issue compulsory purchase orders.  Clearly, this can, in certain circumstances, impact on the land values, the purchase price and, ultimately, the cost of delivery.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked where the balance lies between commercial activities and climate change or sustainability.  As we stated in our submission, it is critical that this authority takes on board the principles of sustainability in delivering the units.  Whether it delivers them directly or indirectly, the principle of sustainability and the need to provide the right housing in the right place at the right price are critical.  While we have welcomed the commercial aspect of the agency, we believe it is critically important that we take on board that need for balance.<\/p> <p>  On the wider point of determining the various functions the committee has set out and the discussions it is having about the balance to be struck, there are a number of different ways to benchmark the performance of the agency.  Some of these relate to commercial return, the number of units it delivers, the location of the units that are delivered, sustainability and so on.  It is important that, through this committee and the legislation, some prioritisation or ranking is given to the benchmarking and the parameters by which, ultimately, the success or failure of the LDA will be determined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Feighan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#F00600","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Coming at the end, it is natural for me to say I agree with everything that has been said.  I will make a couple of observations about land value capture.  In Copenhagen, the authorities had a very interesting model where the port was effectively set up as an LDA-type organisation.  The land it owned, which was the port lands and a very large military site on the edge of the city, were rezoned.  The uplift in the value was used to build a metro and link the lands through the city.  This was a very interesting way of using real value.

At the time, it was port industrial lands.  With the uplift to mixed use and residential, the difference was brokered to borrow to build the metro.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the non-commercial nature, I know this is like a poison but when it was first set up, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, was a very effective and efficient organisation.  It did what it said on the tin.  It remediated land, did public private partnerships with the private sector and delivered social housing in an effective and efficient way, rolling it out incrementally so that we did not end up with sporadic development.  Given the way it was structured after that, we have to look carefully at how it lost the run of itself.  In its initial format, however, the DDDA worked very efficiently.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland on affordability.  Cost model is one of the best models to be used to roll out proper affordable and social housing.  We support making CPO powers available, if only as a deterrent.  They are unlikely to be used but in certain instances it may be necessary to use them.<\/p> <p>  There should definitely be flexibility in the percentages of social and affordable housing.  People forget that site location has a major impact on value.  People also forget that well over half of the population fall into the social and affordable category.  In some instances, the entire site should probably be used for affordable housing and developed out in that way, whereas in other sites where there may be large value uplift, passing that on would have to be very carefully considered.  It might be better to use the uplift in value there to subsidise other sites elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how to get small builders involved, the LDA appears to be structured to do that in that it can license out in smaller packages.  In the way it has developed as a designer, we normally design in phased development.  On phased development, there is a very good model in Germany which breaks up plots.  Instead of having what I would describe as mono-tenure or mono-typology on each plot, within each plot of land there is a social component, an affordable component and a private component.  This may amount to only 50 or 60 units.  By delivering that type of a model of usage, one gets diverse tenancy and architecture on sites.  One also brings in so many different typologies of development, whether co-operative, social or affordable.  The LDA is an ideal organisation to start looking at how we might do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Mahony.

I am sorry I missed the start of them but I read the opening statements in advance of the meeting.  To provide some context, this is the fourth meeting we have had on this legislation.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has covered a number of issues.  In saying that members have concerns, I am not being obstructionist in any way.<\/p> <p>  A common trend across all the presentations is that the witnesses see potentially positive aspects of a land management or land development agency.  That is what we want to see.  What I do not want is for the agency to become another layer and that is a concern.  I have already seen that in some areas where lands have been identified already by the Land Development Agency and significant work has already been done to bring these lands to master plans and so on.  Are we waiting for the establishment of this agency to do something with these?  My general concern is about all the things we should be doing.<\/p> <p>  A number of the witnesses addressed the issue of procurement.  Is this effectively a mechanism to avoid doing anything or changing anything until the agency is established?  I ask that because I believe the agency should not have been established in advance of us seeing the legislation, or at least the heads of the Bill, to find out what it would do.<\/p><p>We have mentioned the need for CPO powers, freedom of information and issues around the lobbying Act, tendering and social value clauses in the procurement process.  There is a lot that is not there but the agency is established, which I think is putting the cart before the horse.<\/p><p> It is absolutely necessary to get the smaller players involved, in design as well as construction, as we have an overdependence on a small number of bigger players to deliver commercial and residential projects and State infrastructure projects.  How can we get them involved?  What makes us think this agency will be any different from any other State agency?  Are there any examples in this State of unbundling contracts to allow the smaller players to get a piece of the pie?  Ten years ago, there was a report of the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue in public procurement, which found we were the second worst in Europe for utilising our own resources and assisting our own economy through the State.  If the Land Development Agency gets a parcel of land, how will it be unbundled?  Is there a risk the agency will act like other agencies, such as the HSE, which look for the lowest costs when giving big contracts instead of looking at their social value?<\/p><p> There is a need for affordable housing and for affordability in the market.  I agree with Ms Myler that it would be good if we did not need a scheme in the future and if affordability simply permeated through the market.  Section 98 of the Planning and Development Act has the proper definition of \"affordable\" because it is not based on the discount and market rate and it is for local authorities to set eligibility.  What does the CIF see as the best way to establish an affordable housing scheme using State lands?  We discussed Holland and other European countries and spoke about selling the land but we do not need to sell all the land.  This is driven with a view to providing a commercial return to the State but that is not necessarily the way we should do it and by delivering houses and good quality homes for people we will yield a long-term saving to the State.  What about long-term leasing of lands and other arrangements such as are available in other countries, where the State retains ownership of the land?<\/p><p> Licensing arrangements are very important and Ms Meghen mentioned a smart guide to public procurement, on which the RIA, the CIF and others have done work.  Have we any examples of local authorities or State bodies using licensing arrangements to get smaller players back into the market?  Last year, I negotiated a provision whereby the local authorities could carry out their own tenders of up to &euro;6 million, which would involve social housing estates of between 40 and 45 houses.  It would speed things up a bit and most local authorities have the expertise to do that.  It was not done this year, which was something we revisited in the budget, but it gave them a bit of freedom and the autonomy to do it.  It was suggested it would be reckless to allow local authorities to spend &euro;6 million and Deputy Casey referred to this.  We are giving this agency &euro;1.25 billion, for which the taxpayer would be on the hook because there is some risk to it.  The prospect of releasing equity based on land values was raised, for such projects as the metro, but things could easily go the other way.  A lot of good work was done by the DDDA but the crash showed the exposure such agencies had.<\/p><p> I would be grateful if Ms Myler expanded on the CPO piece.  Many of the measures the witnesses mentioned are things we should be doing anyway, without waiting for the LDA to be established.  There will be a series of meetings and a report will be produced on a Bill that may not even pass in advance of an election.  I do not want to have to revisit all of this next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#F01100","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>We were asked if any agencies had done procurement in ways that supported smaller companies.  The Office of Public Works has done it, as have the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE.  The OPW has split projects so that it had a lower threshold for smaller projects.  It sets them up with a clear understanding of the nature of the businesses that are tendering.  We consistently see that those who put together the tender documents do not know or understand the service or the product they are buying.  They are setting the bar too high or are asking the wrong questions.  The Department of Education and Skills has a good model which has a very low threshold for very small works and has a ladder process, so that once a company does one project and does it well, it is eligible for a project at the next level up.  In architecture we see large practices doing very well with commercial projects here and internationally, but small practices do very small work while the middle is disappearing.  For regional development and innovation, unless we have a spread of architectural practices and other construction professionals and contracting businesses, we are storing up another problem for ourselves.  The HSE has a system for smaller projects in which it identifies three or four to go on to the framework and then adds a wild card.  All the tenders have to meet a certain threshold but it is low and picking out a wild card means newer businesses are able to get into the model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Meghen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>In tendering, we eliminate the highest and the lowest, which helps to eliminate lowballing which goes on in all areas of tendering.

One of the key measures that could be considered, which the committee has heard before, is the whole notion of cost rental, where affordability is considered to be permanent because the rents cover the costs and the equity that accrues as the loans are repaid creates this notion of a revolving fund that is then plugged into ensuring that further land is available, and that the amenities and services to the land remain of high quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Spillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":611,"content":"<p>We turn now to the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#H00600","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Looking at the establishment of the LDA, it would be a good job for it to have a public portfolio register, and it would be a good start for it at this point in time to have things mapped, visible and transparent.

If that is something which is in the objectives of this group, it is a very good start for every facet of what we want to do with our country.<\/p> <p>  The public service data strategy is very much involved in the provision of that type of information, first, to the public sector, but it is then also available to the rest of us in the commercial field. <\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the Deputy's point about tendering and the licensing piece, which are probably joined up.  We did a survey of our members a while ago and found that, in 2015, some 70% said they were involved in some way or another with public projects whereas that figure is now less than 40%.  I would think that is a reflection of many of our professions and industry sectors where, when commercial projects are available, they will opt for the commercial market and will opt out of the public sector.  I know many local authorities in particular are finding it very difficult to get people to tender, even for small jobs, because it is easier to do the commercial work, which is quicker and cleaner and there is a designated client.  While this might be unpalatable to hear, it is just that essence.  Business is more easily done, or that is the perception of the fact.  There may be great schemes in place, and I know many organisations are involved in them, and it is the same for professional services.  However, while small firms, medium-size firms and larger firms would be on those frameworks, frankly, to get people to engage in them is the challenge, not to develop the process.  I believe the LDA will be a case in point.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the fact we have this fragmentation and we have too many agencies.  We have four local authorities in Dublin but we have no business having four local authorities in Dublin, given the size of the city.  We can look at bigger cities in the UK and see they have one.  If we want to know why we have not managed our processes to date, it is because we have a proliferation of agencies, all crossing each other and with nothing actually happening at the end of the day.  I am not a political person so I am allowed to say things like this but, frankly, the Deputy is right.  If we just put in another layer on top of other layers, maybe some other layers will have to be subsumed into this one, and perhaps that is the sort of project we are looking for at this time. <\/p> <p>  Will it be a fix?  Only if it is given the right powers and resources to do this.  A real culture is starting to be developed all the way through.

The identification of the portfolio piece at a very early stage will be key not just for consumer interests but to have a level playing field for all those within the industry.  A potential tracker as to how that would be monitored for a clear pipeline that would update in real-time is something that will be required of the LDA.<\/p> <p>  On the layer piece, a key word mentioned was \"collaboration\", which will be needed on a couple of fronts.  Very ambitious targets are required to be set out in the coming years and it will take all hands at the pump to deliver that in the different sectors.  A couple of bodies will be needed to accomplish that.  One point we would want to see in the legislation is the early involvement of the industry and professional bodies.  We do not want to get to a very prescriptive stage with regard to tendering.  The expertise within the market as to what will be suitable and appealing as a tenure in the future will be important under the LDA. <\/p> <p>  On the leasing side, we have seen significant changes in the leasing models and there have been some proactive local authorities in recent times.  It provides a viable funding model for many of the regions, which we should not forget about.  This is sometimes just not viable in regional Ireland because there are issues with funding.  To have that model would provide a viable alternative in many cases, and it is something we would encourage. <\/p> <p>  Financing is key to the licence agreements.

We represent all the house builders in Ireland.  Many of the small and medium-sized builders in Dublin and further afield have had their balance sheets broken.  As we said in our opening statement, they have effectively gone through ten years of nothing happening.  When it comes to procurement, whether from an LDA or local authority perspective, these guys need flexibility.  They cannot be looked on as basket cases.  One has to take into account the journey they have been on.  It is something that has been almost ignored in the discussion.<\/p> <p>  On the affordability issue, there is a lack of understanding of the true cost of developing apartments and houses.  I did a quick analysis yesterday.  We are in the process of tendering so this is live data.  The cost of building an 800 sq. ft two-bedroom apartment is exactly the same as a 1,600 sq. ft four-bedroom house.  We are not a basket-case country.  In the US and Canada, and on the Continent, everyone is suffering from increased costs due to regulation.  No one wants to say regulation is not a good thing; we all want to embrace regulation and build to the best standards.  However, first-time buyers are like people buying their first car; they want to buy a Volkswagen Golf and not a Tesla.  Whereas with the housing market, we are trying to deliver a Tesla to the first-time buyer.  That is creating a major affordability gap and it needs to be addressed.  <\/p> <p>  There have been suggestions about how the LDA can help that by having the land come in at a lower value than what the private market is paying for it.  That is part of the solution.  Having said that, committee members have made reference to the land market and I believe the land market has softened.  Many sites are not moving in the market.  Approximately three years ago, land was moving very fast and at very high prices.  Most members of the IHPA stayed out of the land market because they just could not afford to compete in it.  I can see that in our own valuations with banks.  Land values are beginning to soften.<\/p> <p>  A big part of the land value softening is related to the increase in construction costs.  We are seeing increasing construction costs.  We are tendering to small and medium-sized contractors as well as very large contractors, and we are seeing increasing costs.  Much of it relates to the lack of resources in the industry.  We are competing with other countries for materials.  We are competing with all the big countries in Europe for insulation products, steel etc.  We need to pay the same price or even more to get it into our supply chain.  People regard affordability as being a house at &euro;300,000.  It is very hard to produce it at that level even with a very low land value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>The committee has discussed the matter and I intend to propose that it does a forensic, deep-dive review of construction costs and the factors that are inhibiting us from realising our house-building potential now.

I have a fundamental problem with that.  Is this adding another layer to the bureaucracy?  At the moment local authorities and AHBs are delivering social housing.  The LDA is now moving into that sphere.  There is nothing to stop the local authorities and AHBs sitting down and negotiating with the agency as opposed to the Department to finish out sites.<\/p> <p>  On oversight, at the moment local authorities and AHBs need to go through the four-stage approval process in the Department.  The Minister suggested that they do not have the capability to manage &euro;6 million without going through the four-stage Department approval process.  However, it could go to the LDA and there does not seem to be any oversight or processes in place.  I am becoming concerned about the complexity of the situation.  Who will ultimately be responsible for the delivery of housing?  Is it the LDA, the local authorities or the AHBs?  Where does the Department fit into this process?  Who will continue to fund the agency into the future?  As Ms Orla Hegarty said yesterday, the &euro;1.25 billion will deliver 5,000 units, which is only a starting point.  Do the witnesses believe there is enough oversight of the LDA?<\/p> <p>  Has the democratic process been taken out in the establishment of the LDA?  What function does it have regarding its sites agreeing with local area plans and county plans?  Strategic housing development can go straight to the An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which can use national regulations that supersede local area plans or county development plans.  We are beginning to see that in our towns at the moment, where much higher density is being achieved where a local area plan would have used a lower density.  I have an issue with the democratic process and the input that the public have into that process.  They have no say in what the LDA does; they have a key say in their county development plan.<\/p> <p>  On affordability, the other phrases that keep coming through in the Bill are \"commercial viability\", \"profit\", \"joint ventures\" and the need for \"return on investment\".  When we transfer State land, we talk about market value.  Ms Meghen said that we should benefit from the uplift in value.  If we keep going on the uplift value, I do not know how we will ever deliver affordability because all we are doing is increasing the cost of housing.  Why can we not transfer State land at the cost to the taxpayer?<\/p><p>We could use that saving to invest in the infrastructure that is required.  We need to row back a little and engage in detailed master planning for every town in this country, pooling State and private land together.  Where State land cannot support 100% social and affordable housing, a percentage of it can be leveraged and the social and affordable housing can be located elsewhere in the town, with the uplift being used to provide the infrastructure.  We can use the vacant site levy to penalise developers for not delivering on sites.  As mentioned by Ms Hegarty, these master plans could be broken down to benefit small builders, architects and engineers.

There is such a good level of interaction with the local authorities and the projects have to be developed to such an extent that before they are brought to the local authorities there is good oversight in regard to what is being delivered.

When it comes to drafting our local area plans, they should be 3D rather than two dimensional.  The plans need to examine all sorts of issues such as public open space, heights, location of amenities etc. This should become part of a more detailed planning.  The LDA is a good body that might act as a monitoring body with oversight in regard to the delivery of social housing and how and where it is to be delivered.  Mr. O'Neill, with whom I am working on a project, mentioned regulation and how to reduce the cost of housing so that it becomes more affordable.  As architects, there are models that we work on.  Taking density and the levels and graduations of density, up to approximately 100 units per ha can be built using domestic methods of construction such as walk-up apartments, a mix of housing, apartments and duplex units, which is ideal in certain suburban areas.  Using those methodologies, one is attempting to control the cost of housing.  Construction starts to get expensive when we move away from the small builder being able to build using domestic forms of construction.  These are areas where we as architects can effectively work with builders and quantity surveyors to start delivering models of housing that just about fall into the affordability model.  Some good examples were built before the bust, which used public private partnership, PPP, medium density housing, domestic forms of construction and removed underground parking and so on to make construction affordable.  Hopefully, some of that work will feature in the report on regulation for larger housing schemes.<\/p> <p>  On cross-subsidisation and the concern that the LDA will be opaque in the manner in which it conducts its business, I agree that its planning remit is open.  The SHD process is working well.  As practitioners, we see it working very effectively and delivering very quickly.  If the lessons that are learned from that are passed in two or three years, assuming its lifespan will be extended, when the agency ceases operating, it will be a job well done.

While local authorities and the LDA are important in terms of the delivery of housing, which is the key issue for this committee, the provision of infrastructure with housing being only a part of that is even more important.  There are three elements to this: where people live, which is what we are considering in terms of housing; where people work and the other services required in terms of education, health, recreation, culture and so on; and how we link those areas together.  We have an affordability problem because, to a large extent, the location of our services and jobs and where people are living are not co-ordinated.  It is important to understand that.  The fear in regard to the provision of housing is that because we have a deficit and it is seen as an emergency, we may make the same mistakes again.  As land becomes available, we prioritise the development of those projects for housing even if they are not sufficiently co-ordinated and pulled together from a sustainability point of view in respect of transport links to health, education and so on services.  We need to pull back and review our planning.  Local authorities have a role at this level.  We have regional oversight but we also need national oversight.

The issue is whether those skills will be available at the right level and in the right quantities.  Engineers Ireland has been examining the profile of those currently in the market who are engineers and those who are considering engineering as a future career.  This is an issue on which we have engaged across the construction sector as well.<\/p><p>There is most definitely an issue in particular for people considering careers in the construction sector because of the sector's volatility.  There is competition within the engineering profession between the traditional fields of structural and civil engineering and other disciplines, and we can see people being drawn away in that regard.  That is most likely happening in other areas too, so we have a big job of work to do to try to convince young people that there are long-term, sustainable and exciting careers in the construction sector that have a lot of potential, involve innovation and can take them into using technology and cutting-edge practices.  I do not think young people see that potential at present.  Deputy Casey mentioned apprenticeships.

From the point of view of young people considering careers in the construction sector, this could be a very positive thing.

To touch on the point Ms Spillane ended with, we are concerned about geography, a subject as close to our area as one can get, being removed from the junior certificate exams.  As was said, we must think more widely.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the county development plans, and picking up on, I think, Mr. O'Mahony's point about the three-dimensional perspective, it is important that the LDA can contribute to that process to ensure that it gives its perspective and challenges the local authorities to give greater depth in order that they can make informed strategic plans, which, it is hoped, can lead to innovation.  We have mentioned in our submission the SDZs and how they could be a useful tool, particularly in giving the LDA a straight line such as &quot;this is the local authorities' thinking in this area; let us move to implement it&quot;.  With a commercial <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>, one would go for the projects with the fewest barriers and risks involved, build capacity, etc.  I think the commercial point has come up several times.  I believe Mr. O'Neill referred to the apartment versus the four-bed in the suburbs, but there is an externality cost.  In the city one does not have to support that cost but, from the perspective of the buyer, somebody else will flip the bill, namely, the people in this room and the people of this country.<br\/><br\/>I think there is a greater scope in object 2(c), which Ms Meghen mentioned, to take a wider view on this, instead of just the positive financial return, and the holistic return on investment that is available.  That would be an important aspect, whether it is urban or town sprawl we need to address.  The LDA could be a positive change to this whole area.  This is where one would need to look at the objects.  I do not think we necessarily need to involve the LDA in small construction; rather, it needs to build communities, think about larger blocks of land and have a role in areas where there is not capacity within the local authorities or other bodies.  To that end, there is an important role for the committee and others in looking at the mapping of the agencies.  I was involved in the employment process in my previous work, and one thing that became quite clear was that there were a myriad of agencies doing a lot of work and it took a long time to figure out which was the right body to do what and to help because they were all at different levels.  As we design a new agency, understanding HBFI, the local authorities and that mapping process quite clearly such that everybody understands what role each group plays will be essential as a prerequisite of this legislation.<br\/><br\/>I do not know if there was anything else to respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Regarding the skills issue, Deputy Casey talked about apprenticeships, and we have talked about this with the construction sector group before.  Looking to the future, we consider that quite a lot of what we build, if it has a standard format, will be built on a modular basis.  The skills we will need in five or ten years' time are therefore not the skills we have today.  A body such as the LDA could drive the implementation of some of this future-based production method of building, whether of houses or other buildings, such as schools.  Necessarily, then, the agency will almost influence and inform the skills the people working in the sector will need.  I see this as an opportunity for a manufacturing base in this country.  This is a submission we made even in this year's budget.  We have always been good at making things around the construction components, but I refer to the agency's knowledge of the demand that is out there, for instance, in social and affordable housing to commission a lot of these.  As CIF rightly says, we are in competition for supply of many components, be they modular or traditional elements of building.  If we could produce some of those here ourselves, that would be fantastic.  Bodies such as the LDA potentially flatten out the up-and-down cycles we have had across our delivery cycle for our entire existence, frankly.  If, as I said, they can modulate that critical economic cycle we have in construction, it will give people more confidence to come to work in the market and the sector.  It will also give them a future-facing skills base with which to do that.  That is what we are all about in Ireland: upskilling and adding value.  Regarding the LDA, that sounds a bit tangential at this point.<\/p> <p>  I will make one further point about governance.  I can totally see why it would appear to be undemocratic to have an all-encompassing agency with very few employees reporting to one line manager about the entirety of the country's assets, and I absolutely hear Deputy Casey's concerns in that regard.  Nailing this down in the legislation will be like nailing jelly to a wall, but it will have to be done.  The competition that might be perceived in the private sector would be a concern in that the LDA would be almost too powerful in a way and that competition with the private sector could be somewhat off-putting.  That is an important balance that the legislation will have to get right.  It should not undermine the efforts many good local authorities already make to go out and buy in pieces of land and pieces of property that they see there might be a strategic value to in five or ten years' time.  They might not even bother doing that because they might believe that somebody else will do it for them or that there is no need because somebody might decide for them that that is not the best use of their time and that they want them to do something else.  That very strategic balance between local and national powers will have to be struck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>While the construction industry can do many things, nailing jelly to a wall is probably not one of them.

All my counterparts made good points.  The premise of this needs to be reiterated.  There is an obligation on the State to ensure an effective housing supply in all sectors of society.  This brings into the equation the whole private sector and the private element of this.  I will let Mr. O'Neill discuss that in a little more detail in the second half of our response to Deputy Casey.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the SHDs, I will take this opportunity to reiterate that we are waiting for the announcement due very shortly - at the end of this month, I think - from the Minister as to whether that process will be retained, reformed or concluded.  Again, we have called for its extension, although we recommend that some elements within it be reformed.  It has worked not to fast-track but to speed up and smooth out some of the issues that were within the planning process.  It gives a good opportunity to highlight some of the items we discussed around viability and affordability earlier.  Looking at the recent figures, in recent weeks we have seen approximately 23,815 units approved under the SHD process, of which 51% are apartments, residential units, and 29% student accommodation.  We have probably only seen a fraction of those going to the ground and actually happening.  There are a couple of reasons for this, viability being one and affordability being another.<\/p><p>Getting it shovel-ready can take a minimum of seven or eight months, from when permission is granted to when a developer or home builder can put the shovel in the ground to get the works under way.  Securing the finance, drawdowns and meeting the legal conditions attached to planning permission will take up to six additional months after its granting.<\/p><p> I will comment on the vacant site levy, as it was referenced and ties into some of the points made earlier.  Neither the industry nor the federation encourages land hoarding in any shape or form.  It must be recognised that, under the national planning framework, the assessment and identification of lands which comply with the guidelines and directives in the regulatory impact analysis, RIA, and under the county development plan will prove to be quite a difficult task for any local authority or planning authority.  We need to ensure the lands identified are viable sites, with the necessary infrastructure and services in place, rather than just zoned lands.  That issue needs to be addressed in the coming months when we will see it included in some of the county development plans coming up to consultation stage.<\/p><p> Careers and apprenticeships are massive issues.  We have spoken about other issues in the House, as has always been reiterated.  On the whole, apprenticeship numbers are up, but we need to be cognisant of the wet trades which are always considered to be the dirty element of the trades.  The overall numbers are up, as we can see in the most recent SOLAS figures which were only released in the past few days.  While the numbers of apprenticeships in the wet trades were already down to double figures, they have dropped by a further 50% in recent months.  Only a handful of plasterers and brick layers are coming through the apprenticeship scheme.  The resources for the trades will no longer be there if something is not done about this in the coming months or years.  The Construction Industry Federation has put huge emphasis on apprenticeships and bringing resources for both the wet trades and other elements into the industry.  We have backed the Skills Live campaign.  There is also a shared apprenticeship scheme, focusing on regional Ireland, which is trying to get together a cohort of developers, home builders and contractors to share an apprenticeship scheme as taking on apprentices can be quite onerous for them.  We will also launch a careers campaign in the next few months that will aim to attract a younger cohort into apprenticeships.  Third level education is one way to get into the industry, but a viable living of good quality can be earned through apprenticeship schemes, something which is not always emphasised.  A huge amount of work has also been done to provide career guidance within schools.  We facilitate our own members in going into schools in order to highlight that a good career can be achieved through apprenticeships.  There is a huge amount of work being done and we need to be careful not to be our own worst inhibitors.  We cannot constantly give out about the boom-bust cycle in the construction industry, on the one hand, while encouraging people into it, on the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>To address Deputy Casey's comment on the democratic process, I agree that we need some detailed master plan for all towns and cities.  Once that plan is in place and people come forward with applications consistent with it, there should be no objection process.  That would fix the democracy piece.  I have been involved in numerous SHD planning applications and people are still able to make submissions about applications.  In a number of our decisions we have found that the board will take on board comments that come through submissions and condition certain things in planning applications to ensure those concerns are addressed throughout the project.<\/p> <p>  I refer to stakeholder engagement.  We spend a lot of time engaging with schools, religious orders and neighbours to our sites to tell them what we are planning.  Even doing this collaboratively does not stop people from having the right to object, but, at least, they feel they have been informed.<\/p> <p>  I do not know anyone who wants an apartment building within 20 m or 50 m of his or her house.  However, what the Minister and the Department have done with the apartment guidelines is address an issue in the overriding of certain development plans.  Mr. King referred to sprawl.  We can continue to build low rise housing and sprawl out further and further, but we need higher density housing and higher buildings along the Luas and DART lines.  That is the right thing to do for the long-term sustainability of the environment, with everything else.  I do not apologise for using the apartment guidelines to override certain development plans which included a restriction of two or three storeys beside a Luas line, which does not make any sense.<\/p> <p>  The SDZ system was mentioned.  What happened with the DDDA expedited the delivery of the proper type of product in the proper locations.  That will create a level playing field, whether the product is being developed by the LDA or a private builder in the private market.  Ms Myler also touched on this issue and how the LDA might impact on regular house builders and competition.  We do not know what that looks like at this time.<\/p> <p>  I cannot do anything about nailing jelly to walls, but another point was raised about modular construction, which is part of the solution and will help to modernise our building techniques.  Modular construction only works where there is repetition, volume and a standardised approach, which is hard to get on many Dublin sites.  It is very hard to find a site large enough for modular construction to work.  We are building timber-framed housing which is quicker to build than traditional housing and better in some ways.  We have to look at new systems of construction because we have a huge issue with trades and have to find better ways to deliver them off-site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Neill"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571180400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":639,"content":"<p>These exchanges have been very illuminating and confirmed many key issues about which committee members have been concerned and with which they have been grappling.  Mr. O'Mahony has stated we must not let the LDA lose the run of itself and that the Bill needs to constrain it.  However, we also must make sure we do not lose the run of ourselves.  In the complexity surrounding the establishment of the LDA we must not create another monster that will add to those layers of complexity, rather than remove the barriers and obstacles to addressing the housing crisis.  We must remind ourselves of the context in which the Bill has been brought forward.  There are 10,000 people living in emergency accommodation, of whom 3,750 are children.  There are a further 72,000 people on local authority waiting lists, while many more are paying extortionate and prohibitive rents.  Whatever else the LDA does, it has to address that matter.  I welcome the delegates' affirmation that it must be its key objective.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the focus on the mix of housing.  According to the summary of social housing assessments for 2018, 47%, or almost half, of the 72,000 households on local authority waiting lists are headed by a single person.  If we are addressing crises, we have to address that issue.  Of the 10,000 people living in emergency accommodation, just over 4,000 are households headed by a single person.  Whatever the outcome of the LDA's work, it must address both homelessness and the type of housing homeless persons need.  Important reflections were also made about the ageing population.  I live in a house that is too big for me as my children have left home.  Many others are in the same position.  Even if one wanted to downsize, often there is no stock available.  Older people and people with disabilities could also live in the mixed communities that were described.<\/p> <p>  Sustainability is important.  On Sunday night I delivered a wedding present to my niece who lives in Ballincollig.<\/p><p>Her house is at the edge of Ballincollig.  A single car was in front of every house, two in some cases.  If we are serious about climate change, we need to reverse that trend of sprawl and people needing cars to be able to go to work.  I am interested in the witnesses' thoughts on the objectives and the complexity involved in addressing the objectives, which involve ending homelessness for those 10,000 people at the very minimum and getting the right kind of houses in the right kind of places that are good for people and our communities.  We are proposing a significant handover of public assets.  Deputy Casey talked about &euro;1.25 billion.  This is a significant transfer.  In the ratios proposed, we are talking about 10% social housing that would be in the ownership of the State.  This equates to 15,000 houses.  I am not a businessperson but that does not seem like a great deal.  Again, I am interested in hearing the witnesses' views on that.  How can we nail down affordability?  As somebody said at a previous meeting of this committee, affordability means one can afford to pay for it so it is a very relative term.  How do we gravitate towards a cost model because housing is far more than a commodity or something to be traded?  It is the very roof over a person's head where a person can rear a family, go to school, live a life and get a job.  I am concerned about giving away of significant amounts of public assets that now belong to all of us for a return that is very small in terms of public ownership.  I am interested in the Copenhagen model.  If the witnesses have any details about that, it would be something at which the committee would like to look.  <\/p><p> I am also very interested in the idea of apprenticeships.  I am doing a lot of work on Traveller rights and issues.  The unemployment rate among Travellers is 80%.  It seems a no-brainer for CIF, the engineers, architects and others to reach out to that community because it is only 40,000 people anyway.  That would be of enormous benefit.  There were traditions of craft and making in that community that, sadly, have been lost but interesting connections could be made.  I include other hard-to-reach communities.  I know people who work in Youthreach.  The people going through those programmes are crying out for the kinds of work where there seem to be shortages.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' comments on those points.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#M00400","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Looking at the numbers mentioned by the Senator - the 10,000 people who are homeless - that is one of the most shocking indictments of the country.

We have a significant oversupply of family housing and there is significant re-balancing to be done to create more balanced communities.  The old model seemed to be about putting in three and four-bedroom houses and not matching them to the actual community base.  Nowadays, we should be capable of being much more forensic about what goes on to each site from a local point of view so there should be a percentage of housing for older people and a percentage of first-time starter homes in order that people can live their entire lives in one community.  We need to be more forensic about how we design and lay out our estates.  <\/p> <p>  I have a question at which the committee might look.  When the LDA was first promoted - when the first document came out identifying what the LDA would do - it had two functions.  One was as a land development agency to take public land and develop it efficiently, while the other seemed to be really interesting.  It was to follow a Dutch and German model whereby the agency would have the powers to designate areas as regeneration areas, purchase the land at that land value cost and develop it over time so that as the value went up, it was shared with the landowners.  What was proposed was that the LDA would have a bank of land it would be able to work through in the event of a recession.  It was also an element that might control the price of land.  This has disappeared from any of the legislation I have seen.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Mahony think that should come back into the frame?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#N00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>It would be worth going back and having a look at what the remit was originally supposed to be.

We need apartments, duplexes and different densification models.  The difficulty is getting people to buy into those types of units.  Our underlying legislation, the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, was a good start, but needs to be overhauled to encourage the concept of the common good that exists in more mature markets which feature apartment schemes.

As a result, there may be a resistance to move into that kind of development.  We have already discussed the question of the underlying legislation with the Department.  As I have said, the 2011 Act was a good start but it definitely needs revision.  The points on population growth are really important.

Vienna has a target to retain 60% of the housing stock in public ownership.  It is not quantified in terms of social or affordable housing; it is just public housing.  If one can afford to rent a unit at a reasonable market rent, that is the rent one will pay, but it is retained in public ownership.  This was achieved over 100 years so we are not going to do so over ten, 20 or 30.

Early association with the professional bodies and industry will be key for the LDA.

Elements of age-friendly construction can be implemented very early in the design stage.

Every company has a constitution, or what we used to call a memorandum and articles of association, but the objectives of a company can be quite specific; they do not all have to be profit-based.  A company's objective is to deliver housing, whether social, affordable or whatever else.  It does not have to be overly prescriptive and specify the amount of housing to be private and the amount to be social.  Flexible wording can be employed.  One of the Senator's concerns regarding the objectives is that she wants delivery of housing to be predominantly State-led.<\/p> <p>  To touch on one of the points about homelessness, which is a real issue, there is a very significant issue with regard to the management of our public-owned housing stock.  The Senator mentioned examples herself.  I know many people who live in large houses despite only two people living there while there are families of four or five living in hotel rooms.  There is something wrong with that model.  It is not as if we do not have enough roofs in the country to house these 10,000 people, we are just not managing stock correctly.  The first house I bought in Dublin, 20 years ago, was a council house.  I probably paid 25 times the price the vendors had paid for it.  Retention, recycling and efficient management of the public-owned housing stock is key to the homelessness problem.  If the LDA is going to deliver social and affordable housing, that housing has to be retained.  Mr. O'Mahony mentioned leasing it.  It is a key point.  This housing needs to be retained, kept in public control, and managed properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Neill very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#O01300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I am not against the Land Development Agency, I just have some reservations and concerns about it and feel that it could potentially do more.  One of the key things that has come across today is that it could bring about stability in development to prevent cycles occurring.  I fully accept the concept that, in a time of recession, this agency might be in a position to continue building when the private sector is not.  It has a very significant role to play in that regard.  I will try to expand my point a little bit further.  We should be putting significant resources into the concept of master-planning.  It is not going anywhere near far enough.  Senator Kelleher has just spoken.  None of us ever planned for enough one-bedroom and two-bedroom housing.  That is the level of detail we should be getting to within the master planning in order to avoid having too many three-bedroom houses, shops, or whatever other type of unit.<\/p><p>We must invest significant resources in local authorities to enable them to prepare a master plan to the level required.  We must then prioritise the provision of infrastructure.  We must engage in zoning, come up with a timescale and provide the infrastructure.  We can then apply the vacant sites levy in a much more transparent manner.  It is being applied in different ways by different local authorities and there is no real transparency.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Neill has mentioned that local authorities have nowhere to send a single person who is living in a four-bedroom house because they have not built any accommodation for such a person.  That brings us back to the problem of not engaging in detailed planning, which means that huge opportunities are being lost.  If there was high quality accommodation available to such a person, he or she would probably move willingly, but, unfortunately, it is not available.  <\/p><p> In terms of financial viability in the context of the fiscal space available, the Land Development Agency is being set up based on a ratio of 60% private and 40% public and on the basis that it will be off-balance sheet.  Whether one agrees with the Government, it is stuck with it.  If it were to create a model tomorrow morning that 100% of the units would be social and affordable, it would be ruled that it would be on-balance sheet.  The sum of &euro;1.25 billion n the fiscal space will prevent us from investing in other infrastructural projects.  The Government did not do enough in lobbying EUROSTAT and the European Commission to highlight the importance of housing to us as a society.  The provision of social and affordable housing should not be included in the figures for the fiscal space or some percentage of it should be allowed to be excluded.  When the 13 large approved housing bodies went from being off-balance sheet to being on-balance sheet, it was not just State debt that was on-balance sheet but every piece of debt.  Even private investment in approved bodies now forms part of the fiscal space.  The State has not done enough in lobbying the European Union to remove social and affordable housing provision from the fiscal space.  If that were done, the Land Development Agency could deliver a lot more social and affordable housing units.  That said, I understand it is restricted in what it can do because of the off-balance sheet issue.  <\/p><p> Ms Myler suggested local authorities should be buying more land, but they cannot do so without departmental approval.  Furthermore, the local authorities cannot borrow any money without departmental approval.  If they want to take out a loan, they must first get councillors on board and then obtain the approval of the Department.  In fairness, some land was bought at the height of the boom.  It was included in the land aggregation scheme, through which we are still working our way.  This is an area in which the Land Development Agency should be involved.  It should be assessing the potential to use land and buy it before it becomes unaffordable.  That is a critical role played by the agency.  <\/p><p> Mr. O'Mahony spoke about buying regeneration sites and the fact that the landowner only profited when the land was developed.  In that way, the State does not have to fork out initially.  I must look it up because it is an interesting concept.  I have a question for Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Benson about Home Building Finance Ireland.  Is there evidence that it is working?  Is it getting into smaller rural areas, including rural towns, where smaller builders cannot access finance?  Is there any information available on that aspect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101600002#O01400","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I will continue with the convention of moving from one end of the room to the other.

There has to be a way to run that system more efficiently.  Perhaps there could be a Land Development Agency clearing house.  Perhaps the LDA might look at social housing delivery and try to come up with a more efficient way to clear spending on social housing.  I must declare an interest here in the context of the procurement process for the O'Devaney Gardens project.  There must be a better way to do it than the way being employed for the project.  Again, it comes down to the LDA being a body that can procure more efficiently and effectively in order that the professionals and builders can be attracted back to the public sector.

In the case of towns such as Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Westport and Enniscorthy, a municipal architect has been put in charge of curating the development of the urban fabric of the town or village, creating somewhere that is vibrant, safe and has mixed tenure with a mixed demographic.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

Notwithstanding the remit of this committee, the challenge is that in cyberspace, everything is connected, and therefore laws that attempt to address cyberbullying will arguably be ineffective in the absence of addressing a more comprehensive range of online harms.  The United Kingdom online harm White Paper offers a thorough treatment of these issues, noting:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIllegal and unacceptable content and activity is widespread online, and UK users are concerned about what they see and experience on the internet.  The prevalence of the most serious illegal content and activity, which threatens our national security or the physical safety of children, is unacceptable.  Online platforms can be a tool for abuse and bullying, and they can be used to undermine our democratic values and debate.  The impact of harmful content and activity can be particularly damaging for children, and there are growing concerns about the potential impact on their mental health and wellbeing ... The internet can be used to harass, bully or intimidate, especially people in vulnerable groups or in public life.  Young adults or children may be exposed to harmful content that relates, for example, to self-harm or suicide.  These experiences can have serious psychological and emotional impact.  There are also emerging challenges about designed addiction to some digital services and excessive screen time.  <\/blockquote><p>Notably, the UK approach does not focus exclusively on fragmented aspects of harm.  Rather, a broad range of harms is considered simultaneously, including online anonymous abuse, child sexual exploitation and abuse, harassment and intimidation directed at those in public life, cyberbullying, violence online, designed addiction, underage sharing of sexual imagery such as sexting, self-harm and suicide.  The point centres on connectivity.  There is a relationship between cyberbullying, self-esteem and self-harm.  There is also a relationship between \"sexted\" images, harassment, online coercion and extortion.  Many countries are in the process of developing new regulatory approaches to tackle online harms.  However, none has as yet established a regulatory framework that tackles the connected range of online harms.  The UK will be the first country to do this.  I have advised the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on the role of technology in online harm.  Significant progress has been made.  As an important hub for technology companies, Ireland should be demonstrating cyber leadership but it has unfortunately made little or no progress to date despite numerous investigations and reports.  At this point my submission references appendix A, which outlines a timeline going back to the Internet content governance advisory group in 2012.<\/p><p> Technology is new and fascinating.  It has a pervasive, profound impact on humans and a highly seductive momentum.  It has revolutionised access to knowledge, education and social reform.  Nevertheless, left unfettered it has also exploited the vulnerabilities of our children.  The influence of the Internet and social media is not an abstract concept.  Its impact is not virtual; it impacts real lives in the real world.  Monetising harm by designing intelligent algorithms to promote extreme content and harvest dollars from a child in the \"attention economy\" is not about celebrating access; it is about exploitation.  In the bricks-and-mortar world, we have recognised for centuries that defending freedom for adults to speak and express opinions does not mean giving adults a licence to exploit and harm children.  I passed an Eason store on the way here.  I did not see any glossy magazines promoting self-harm, DIY suicide or anorexia made freely available to children beside the comics on the lower shelves.  That is a repugnant idea of course, but this is the reality of the Internet.<\/p><p> We have been here before.  We have seen the damage that is done when commercial interests are allowed to exploit vulnerability and addiction and to operate without restraint.  We have seen it with big tobacco and more recently with the opioid crisis.  We see common themes - wilful and deliberate exploitation and obfuscation; decisions made behind closed doors that either deliberately ignore evidence of harm or try to make it someone else&rsquo;s problem; denial of responsibility and victim-blaming.  While adults debate, posture and play \"pass the blame parcel\" the social technology industry keeps thriving, money keeps flowing and the online harm continues.<\/p><p> In deliberating on the broad area of online harm, we must ask ourselves the questions of who, what and when.  Who is being harmed?  Who has sought to exploit that harm, either by designing clever code to profit from it, wilfully ignoring its harmful effect or actively denying responsibility for it?  What is the harm - what real lives are being damaged?  What are the consequences of doing nothing?  When did Internet stakeholders become aware of the damage being caused to children and, importantly, when did we all do something about it?<\/p><p> In 2014 I raised some of these issues in the report of the Internet content governance advisory group, which was convened in 2012.  I also advised the Law Reform Commission, whose report on harmful communications and digital safety was published some three years ago.  In the intervening five years, thousands more children have been unnecessarily exposed to repugnant, harmful, toxic and life-damaging material.  This must stop.  It demeans all of us.  The Internet was designed on the premise that all users are equal.  This is not the case.  Some are more vulnerable than others and children are particularly vulnerable.  Our challenge as a society is to help shape an Internet that is open and vibrant but also protects its users from harm.  The Constitution requires the State and organs of the State to protect and vindicate as best it can from unjust attack.  Article 42A affords additional rights by affirming \"The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.\"  Exposing Irish children to a range of online harms is a fundamental breach of their constitutional rights.  Our challenge as policymakers is not to engage in determined myopia and deliberate fragmentation strategies or to allow commercial stakeholders to perpetuate skilful deflection and obfuscation strategies.  Our challenge is to urgently develop a new system of accountability in the form of legislative and statutory instruments and oversight that will replace the current failed model of self-regulation.  A new Irish regulatory framework regarding online harm is urgently required, one that will make clear the technology industry's responsibility to protect Irish users, particularly our children, online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":701,"content":"<p>It is not my intention to read my statement, as it runs to 15 pages.  However I will very quickly give an overview of the three areas I cover.  The statement is available to the committee and deals with these points in more detail.  Before I start I would like to make a point about positioning.  I represent the telecommunications industry in another guise.  Everything I say today is in my full-time role as a lawyer and a member of the Bar and the Law Library.  Nothing that I utter is to be connected to any other representation or any other advocacy roles that I may hold.<br\/><br\/>I will deal with three areas in my submission.  The first is the role of hosts under EU Directive No. 2000\/31\/EC, the electronic commerce directive, and SI 68\/2003, particularly regulation 18.  I wish to make several points on that.  The headline point is that in its deliberations the committee should be careful about declaring hosts to be publishers.  The knock-on effect of making such a recommendation and reporting in that fashion could have serious effects for commerce and social interaction online.  I acknowledge a lot of what Dr. Aiken has said.  I am not in conflict at all with what she says about harm and issues in cyberspace in that sense.  However, there is an overarching issue here.  European law is directly effective and supreme and reforms to the e-commerce package are <i>en route<\/i>.  Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, who is hopefully the incoming President of the European Commission, has indicated that a package of reforms on digital safety will be brought forward quite shortly.  <br\/><br\/>I want to make a couple of points which are consistent with Dr. Aiken's points.  It is somewhat disappointing that the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report and the Internet content advisory group have effectively sat on a shelf since 2016 and 2014, respectively.  There are very good recommendations in those reports and as such I respectfully submit that this committee should not reinvent the wheel.  <br\/><br\/>One issue I now see coming before the courts regularly now concerns applications for Norwich Pharmacal orders, disclosure orders under which so-called anonymous activity online is defrocked, users who purport to act anonymously are unmasked and tortious activity is prosecuted.  This prosecution usually takes place through civil lists although it can also be dealt with through criminal legislation.  I also refer to a case which was recently before the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek case.  I am sorry if I got the pronunciation of that lady's surname slightly wrong.  It is a technical pronunciation.  This decision deals with what the State can and cannot do within the hosting provisions and the related package where injunctive relief through the courts is concerned.  It also considers matters this committee might consider, concerning duties of care and how far legislation can go.  I am happy to take any questions on that topic.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to address a point on which Deputy Jack Chambers engaged with some witnesses last week, that is, the issue of counter-speech.  I have a particular concern about using that as a defence to defamation or misbehaviour online.<\/p><p>If someone is attacked, that person can and should vindicate his or her good name per the Constitution, defamation laws or the criminal vocabulary of the law.  It is not adequate to tell people to pick up a loudhailer, have a go back, defame those responsible or do something as bad in return.  That submission does not sync with the constitutional protections of the right to a good name and our legislative instruments.<\/p><p> That addresses the issue of hosts.  The committee should refrain from considering that hosts should just be declared as publishers, because that would put us in a position incompatible with European law and frameworks.  It would be a dangerous place to go.<\/p><p> My second point is consistent with Dr. Aiken's submission.  Self-regulation has been operating in Ireland for approximately 20 years.  Self-regulation requires robust laws to ensure that actors behave in a fashion where they are scared or incentivised into behaving properly or disincentivised from behaving in a bad way.  However, we have eight Departments dealing with online issues.  I set those eight out in my witness statement.  A recent example, and one that has been newsworthy, was that of the report of the Data Protection Commission, DPC, into the public services card.  If the State tells the DPC to take enforcement action against it, how does that make Ireland look on the international stage in terms of compliance with laws?  This is not a political point, but we need to be careful about what messages we send internationally.<\/p><p> That feeds directly into my next point, which is on legislative reform.  I have identified six Acts that are old enough to require a re-examination by the committee in the form of a report or by other organisations of the State.  The first is the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which is a difficult Act to decipher, let alone prosecute, for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It deals with actions, broadcasts and materials likely to incite hatred.  The levels of prosecution are minute.  It is the only area of hate speech legislation that I can find, and it is well out of date and not fit for purpose in light of the Internet and what pervasive access to individuals has created online.  The second is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 as it relates to activities.  I suggest that activities organised online constitute an area that the committee should consider, particularly in terms of congregations of people and, possibly, riotous behaviour.<\/p><p> Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 has been well ventilated in terms of the recommendations of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, ICGAG, and the Law Reform Commission.  Deputy Howlin's Bill is useful but will require significant redrafting and overhauls.<\/p><p> The next Act relates to something that is close to my heart, as I have been on a number of Government child protection advisory groups.  The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is stale and out of date and the wording it contains is wrong.  There are issues in terms of good actors holding blocking lists and so forth.  The Act needs a full overhaul.<\/p><p> The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 may be a good place in which to codify reforms as regards online criminal activity and malicious communications.<\/p><p> The Defamation Act 2009 is relatively new.  Section 5 provides for a revision of the Act within five years, but that has not happened.  In the courts, there seems to be a disjoint between what reliefs can be granted in terms of interlocutory injunctive reliefs or just injunctive reliefs and the vindication of rights when it comes to Internet publications, malicious harm, abuse and so forth.  The Act needs to be examined.<\/p><p> I made points in my submission about a privacy Bill.  Deputy O'Callaghan has raised the matter with other witnesses before the committee.  It may be time to consider introducing privacy legislation, albeit not in a similar vein to what has been published previously in draft Bills.  I am surprised that an upskirting offence is so far buried in the 2017 sexual offences legislation.  Many new offences to do with the Internet and connected to offline activity need to be codified properly.  A malicious communications set of provisions is also required, as has been ventilated well in the Houses since before 2007.<\/p><p> The committee should be careful not simply to report on declaring hosts as publishers.  If the State is going to take matters seriously, there needs to be reform of where responsibility for Internet, speech and hate speech activity sits within the Government.  When the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, attended the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on 21 February 2018, he made it clear that it was unlikely that criminal justice issues would go under any online tsar or role that would be created for protections.  That is the correct position.  Regarding self-regulation, however, we need robust revisions of the law to make actors behave correctly.  I have highlighted six Acts at a quick pace and will happily answer questions on them, but as far as online harm, abusive content and hate speech go, the Statute Book is out of date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lupton.

First, they are the most relevant to the committee's work.  Second, these are areas where we have a national competence as opposed to wider issues of, for example, platform regulation, which are largely a European competence and will be dealt with by the European Commission in the near future, as Mr. Lupton pointed out.  Third, these are the areas where we can get a quick win, as it were, with clear things that we can do to address the most serious types of harm that individuals are facing.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, there is an element of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>for me.  The first time I attended an Oireachtas committee was in March 2013.  The then Joint Committee on Transport and Communications was discussing issues of online safety.  At that hearing, I stated that we needed more resources for the Garda and what is now the DPC, and that we had to make greater use of existing laws.  Unfortunately, we are six years on and I will, to a large extent, be repeating some of those comments because the key legal position in Ireland has not changed significantly since then in terms of the statutes and enforcement structures available to deal with the most serious types of online harm.<br\/><br\/>I will first make a number of specific points about how we enforce the existing legal framework before speaking about how we might reform that framework.  In practice, how do garda&iacute; deal with complaints that come to them?  If an individual tells garda&iacute; that he or she has been the victim of the distribution of intimate images - so-called revenge pornography - or serious online harassment, how is that handled?  In 2013, the Oireachtas hearings followed the suicide of a teenager from Donegal, Erin Gallagher, which was attributed to online bullying.  She had been told by garda&iacute; whom she contacted that it was a civil matter and there was nothing they could do.  Fast forward to today and committee members will be aware of the case of the Ryan and Mathis family, who have been subjected to horrific racial abuse online following advertising that the family took part in for Lidl.  Upon contacting garda&iacute;, the family were told exactly the same thing, namely, that it was a civil matter and there was nothing the Garda could do.  Following the case's publicity, however, a Garda investigation has opened.<br\/><br\/>Even at the outset, though, an investigation could have been commenced into whether the case constituted the existing offence of harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act.  As Mr. Lupton pointed out, that is not a perfect offence and many elements of it could be reformed.  However, garda&iacute; at a local level appeared to be unwilling to commence criminal investigations in a timely manner.  That is not necessarily an issue with individual garda&iacute; but a systemic issue with training and resources.  On occasion, individual garda&iacute; have told the media that they have been unable to investigate these types of complaint because they do not have devices in their stations that enable them to view social media.  In some cases, they have had to resort to doing that on their own personal devices.<br\/><br\/>The lack of resources is reflected in the resourcing provided to what is now the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau.  When I first testified on this issue in 2013, it was then the Garda Computer Crime Investigation Unit.  Since then it has been rebranded, but the resources given to it have remained essentially unchanged.  For the past decade, the number of garda&iacute; within the unit has fluctuated from the low 20s to the high 20s but essentially has remained largely static at a time when the workload has grown exponentially.<\/p><p>The issue is ordinary crimes have become cybercrimes in the sense that if there is evidence on a laptop or phone which needs to be forensically examined, what was the computer crime investigation unit, now the cybercrime bureau, must be involved in that examination.  The problem is that, with some recent very limited exceptions, the resources given to the bureau have not kept pace.  This has had the effect of crowding out investigations into online harassment, given the need to carry out forensic examinations of other types of crime also.  I know that when the head of the bureau, Detective Superintendent Pat Ryan, testified before the committee recently, he indicated that there was a need for 120 staff members within the Garda to deal with these issues, which essentially represents a fourfold increase on the current staffing level of approximately 30.  To a very large extent, the statement that we need to reform the existing law needs to be weighed against the fact that we have failed to adequately resource enforcement of the existing law.<\/p><p> Related to this is the question of how garda&iacute; access information on these crimes.  There are two distinct issues.  One is the question of international co-operation, that is, the use of mutual legal assistance treaties and so on to obtain information from firms which have their headquarters overseas.  However, the issue on which I will focus is domestic access to information, that is, when garda&iacute; have information on a particular IP address, for example, how they go about obtaining information on it from service providers such as Eir or Virgin Media.  As members of the committee will be aware from recent hearings on the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill, it is done under the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.  Since the committee held its hearings on the heads of the Bill that would replace that legislation, the High Court has given its judgment in a case brought by Graham Dwyer to the effect that the core provisions of the legislation, that is, the provisions which require telecoms providers to store certain information and the provisions that allow garda&iacute; to access that information, are contrary to European law.  This decision has been stayed, pending an appeal to the Supreme Court which will be heard this December, but it is quite clear that the legislation is now a zombie.  It is heading towards the Supreme Court where it will invariably be dispatched, be it by the Supreme Court or, ultimately, on reference to the European Court of Justice.  In the meantime it has the effect of undermining both existing convictions obtained using the legislation and ongoing investigations.  We must fault the Department of Justice and Equality for failing to respond in a timely manner to the judgments which found this type of legislation to be unconstitutional and contrary to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and for failing to provide adequate alternative enforcement mechanisms for garda&iacute;.  If garda&iacute; wish to access subscriber information or information on Internet use, the only way they can do so in a way that will stand up to challenge later in the course of a prosecution is by getting either a search warrant or a production order from the District Court.  There is no reason there cannot be a streamlined, expedited procedure which would meet the requirements of European Union law in having an independent authority, for example, permitting requests to be made.  Without this, however, we are hampering investigations in two ways: we are slowing them down and also creating the risk that prosecutions will ultimately be unsuccessful because of the failure to provide the appropriate tools such that convictions will be overturned or not secured as a result.<\/p><p> They are the points I wanted to make about these practical issues and how we enforce the laws we already have in place.  I will also make two brief points about how we introduce new laws.  A model that has been adopted, particularly in some of the Private Members' Bills in this area, is the Law Reform Commission's proposal in the form of the draft Bill attached to its report on harmful communications.  As Mr. Lupton said, there is much in the report that could have been implemented a long time ago.  I agree with the majority of it.  I do, however, have some concerns about the model it has recommended for the digital safety commissioner which has essentially since been adopted, subject to some modifications, by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the context of its proposed implementation of the audiovisual media services directive.  The approach taken by the Law Reform Commission was to state the digital safety commissioner should be established and that, essentially, social media providers - online service providers, generally - should be required to adopt codes of practice which would prohibit harmful content and that a takedown mechanism would then be available, whereby individuals could apply to the providers to have the material taken down and, if they failed to do so, the individual would have a right of appeal to the digital safety commissioner.  The difficulty with this is that the Law Reform Commission in its report did not identify what was meant by \"harmful content\".  It set out a few examples of harmful content, for example, material that would constitute the offence of harassment or material that would constitute a so-called revenge pornography offence, but it left it open-ended.  Effectively, it would require providers to engage in a very subjective assessment of what constituted harmful content and would then leave the digital safety commissioner in the same position when faced with an appeal in determining what constituted harmful content.  It is clear, as a matter of European law, under the European Convention on Human Rights, that this cannot be done.  The convention requires that restrictions on rights such as freedom of expression be prescribed by law.  The case law in this area makes it clear that this requires that there be a degree of predictability, that we should be able to say clearly what type of speech is and is not covered.  The Law Reform Commission's proposals, as adopted, would fail to meet that criterion.<\/p><p> The second point which, in some ways, is more fundamental because it is harder to fix is that the Law Reform Commission's proposals do not address the question of procedural fairness.  If an individual's posts are to be taken down from social media, for example, will he or she be given an opportunity to make a comment on it before they are taken down?  Will he or she be given a right of appeal if they are taken down?  Will there ultimately be recourse to a court in the event that they are taken down?  Again, the standards of the European Convention on Human Rights are quite clear in that regard.  If state bodies, as distinct from private actors, are to make these decisions, there must be, except in exceptional cases in which there is some special justification, notice, an ability to make representations, some redress mechanism and, ultimately, judicial oversight.  Again, the Law Reform Commission's proposals do not provide for this.  There is no question of any individual affected by a take-down notice having the ability to appeal to a court.  This can be contrasted with, for example, the Data Protection Act and the role of the Data Protection Commission, whereby individuals who are told that they must take down content because it is contrary to the data protection rights of an individual have an appeal mechanism open to them in the form of an appeal to the Circuit Court.  Again, therefore, from a procedural fairness aspect, we must consider whether the approach taken by the Law Reform Commission would stand up to challenge.  In my view, it would not.<\/p><p> They are, in broad terms, the submissions I wanted to make on this issue.

The point I am trying to make is that we cannot take a fragmented approach.  We are talking about cyberbullying and harassment, but we must look at all areas of online harm simultaneously if we wish to address them effectively.  That is being done very well in the United Kingdom.  I note this as an Irish citizen who has been party to advising that process and is proud of what has been achieved there.  A very poignant example of the need to address all areas of online harm arose in the comments in July of Mr. Justice Michael White, an esteemed High Court judge, in dealing with a case involving a boy who had sexually exploited his two younger cousins.  He spoke about his great concern at the number of cases of young children who were committing serious offences as a result of pornography on their smartphones.  There has been an unprecedented surge in the number of such cases coming before the criminal courts.  It was reported that the young girl who was the victim in the case had stated she wanted the sexual contact to stop.  The young boy sent her text messages outlining that he had pictures and video recordings of their previous sexual contact.  The court heard that he told her that he would disseminate them to her friends and others online if she did not continue to have sex.  That is revenge porn.  After the event had come to light, she told garda&iacute; that she had had sex with the boy again because she was afraid of this threat.  One must consider the relationship between the act of revenge porn and the availability of adult pornography to children online.  These areas are all connected.  If we are to enact legislation in one area, we must consistently look at all of these areas as, otherwise, we will not tackle the problems effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I agree with Dr. Aiken on the issue of child pornography.

We have a harassment offence and a form of oppressive conduct offence, but parents and other individuals do not have a place to go to state they have a problem with certain content and ask that it be assessed and the necessary steps be taken in the civil vocabulary of law to stop what is going on, whether it be with a host platform provider or by way of referral to the criminal justice authorities.

Deputy O'Callaghan made the point in relation to harassment that we have concern about the persistence requirement and that one-off acts of bullying cannot be criminalised.  The persistence requirement is what takes individual statements, which might well be toxic but do not rise to the level of criminality, beyond that and to the stage where we say, as a society, that criminal intervention is needed.  If we start criminalising one-off statements, it becomes much more difficult to say precisely what type of criminal statement is involved and precisely what type of single speech act of bullying rises to the gravity that justifies the remarkable intervention of the criminal justice system.  That is compounded by the fact that we are trying to avoid criminalising children, in particular.  In most areas of the law we now seek to avoid dragging children into the criminal justice system.  In many ways, it is unhelpful to expand liability further in a way that would do that.<\/p> <p>  I will make one further point in response to the Deputy's question about the persistence requirement and how we define the threshold that is involved.  To an extent, there might be a level of confusion regarding the circumstances in which we are doing it.  On the one hand, we might be talking about criminalising an individual for what he or she posts.  In other circumstances, we might not focus on the individual and we might ask if we should take down this particular content.  It is unhelpful to conflate those two instances because criminalising somebody involves assessing that person's intention.  In the case of these harassment and bullying offences, we are usually looking at a pattern of behaviour.  Making decisions to take down individual elements of content involves assessing the individual element, usually in isolation.  Content moderators for sites like Facebook or Twitter focus on the individual content and do not usually have a pattern of conduct in front of them.  It is unhelpful to say that we should have the same standards applying in both contexts because it is very hard to read across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

One is into the discussion of online harms, that is, all of the points that we have just discussed in terms of the turf, as it were.  The legislation needs to be brought up to date.  As I make clear throughout my statement, there must be a balancing act, as Senator Conway mentioned, between the right to free speech under Article 40.6.1&deg; of the Constitution, the preservation of the good name of citizens in Article 40 and use of the law, perhaps in defamation and other contexts, to vindicate those particular rights.  The answer, therefore, is a categorical \"Yes\".

Do the platforms, which currently act as bystanders in such cases, need to be incorporated into the laws to ensure they, too, are held accountable?  In the case of litigation, if someone has uploaded something on Facebook or Twitter, for example, he or she can be identified and commented on, but the platform in question will step back and say: \"There you go.\"  It is necessary to try to encapsulate the platforms in the law.

The use of the metaphor of the bystander is interesting because the bystander effect, which is inherent in psychology, is the premise of diffusion of responsibility.  There can be such a diffusion that nobody feels responsible or steps up to be accountable.  We have allowed social technology platforms - as opposed to social media, given that search technologies should be considered in the process - to define themselves.  Facebook recently described itself as a movement.  It is fantastic if it wants to describe itself as such but where is the accountability?  It is up to us as policymakers and legislators to say that, in fact, we will define such companies.  We will decide whether they are publishers or broadcasters.  Whether it is user-generated content is not the issue.  Let us imagine that RT&Eacute; Radio left the door open and allowed every man and his dog to walk in off the street and say something on air, and then broadcast it.  It is the same model as somebody broadcasting online.<\/p> <p>  The Garda needs additional expertise, not least in the form of cyberbehavioural scientists, to enhance its efforts.  It needs more resources, including machine intelligence, to tackle the problems.  It has reached out to me on numerous occasions to hold dedicated workshops and training sessions with it.   It is doing its best to keep up in cyberspace but we need to provide additional support and resources, and the country is well placed to do so.

According to the mere conduit defence, in the case of what is transmitted on telecommunications companies' pipes or fibre network, if they do not know what it is, they do not know what it is, until such time as they do, when they have an obligation to act and remove it.  That is a separate defence under European law, the same law I deal with on the hosting site.<br\/><br\/>Platforms above that, such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, have the hosting defence.  Similarly, once content becomes known to them, the information is removed and a defence arises.  Under both those defences, there is an obligation on the State not to mandate monitoring but it can mandate duties of care.  The question is where the line arises between duty of care and monitoring, because the bottom line is that the latter cannot be done.  I am concerned that something will arise from a report that indicates that the State will change the law, which may cause a jarring effect and lead to an incompatibility with European law.  It is the wrong approach.<br\/><br\/>On the point on Garda resources, I fully support, accept and associate myself with Dr. McIntyre's statement to the committee.  We mentioned each other in respect of the e-commerce elements of our submissions.  Two cases, those of Joe O'Reilly and Graham Dwyer, were heavily dependent on telephone records and other types of records that were acquired, such as number plate recognition on the M50.  In the context of the Dwyer litigation, triangulation of mobile phones was undertaken by civilian members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who were very clever and managed to gather circumstantial evidence to result in the prosecution.  On the question of whether the Garda requires resources in a number of areas, the direct answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  Its needs significant resources for combatting child pornography and the most egregious forms of crime that occur on the Internet.<br\/><br\/>Other forms of crime, such as murder and rape, are no less serious, although I do not want to scale crimes.  There should be another unit to deal with such activity.  As I noted in my statement, crimes that occur daily go unprosecuted and un-investiagted because tackling serious crimes is so under-resourced that it takes attention away from what is currently pervasive.  A person could be subject to a cybercrime and need it addressed but can approach only his or her local Garda station to report it.  If the case is not transferred to the central function in Garda headquarters to investigate it properly, good luck.  It will be a case of taking one's chances with the vendor or bank in question, which can try to deal with the problem, even though a criminal act has occurred.  Significant resources are needed in the area.  To return to what Deputy O'Callaghan raised earlier, how do we enable the citizen to seek civil recourse?  It may be that a digital safety-type function is required whereby someone can say what has happened but that he or she is not sure if it is a crime, and request an assessment.  There is room for the State to do that.<br\/><br\/>For years I have sat on various groups that deal specifically with the reporting of child content online, such as the Department's Internet advisory board and Internet safety advisory committee, and now the National Advisory Council for Online Safety.  A <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service exists for reports but it does so in isolation and is funded by the telecommunications industry.  While its works well and closely with the Garda, I know from first-hand experience that the resources are not available to manage and marry the function, which is voluntary.  Its content analysts view horrible reports they encounter from time to time.  It is part of the wider European INHOPE network, which receives reports.  Telecommunications companies are worried, given the current state of legislation, that holding blocking lists may create a criminal offence for them.  That needs to be examined.  While I acknowledge that legislation takes time to process, they are the types of quick wins that could create a different approach to behaviour online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":752,"content":"<p>The only way we will modify human behaviour online, in this domain we have created, is by putting in place laws that create consequences for criminal behaviour such as accessing child pornography, or what we call online child abuse material.

They have an argument there but at the same time, that argument cannot be used to avoid responsibility.  Is there space somewhere between the two that we need to find?

There are papers available, which I have seen, that deal with reforms to this area, such as good samaritan provisions for hosts that become aware of illicit or unlawful content, and take action but say they could be criminally responsible for it.  That element to it exists.  To answer the key point, there is a disincentive to a business that operates in the e-commerce host space to take steps because they say they do not know something is there until they are told and therefore they will take it down until a later stage.  Deputy O'Callaghan was getting at this point earlier.  If one reports content to a host provider one does not like or if there is a criminal offence such as hate speech, suddenly one is met with a response saying it will be assessed.  One is not told under what law or regulation that assessment will be carried out, and the rejection comes with an explanation that the alleged offence has been assessed under the community rules.  That is probably US law being applied but it could be someone sitting in India doing the assessment.  Who knows where they are sitting.  I said in my witness statement that there is a disjoint between the application of national law - and regional law in the European context - and what should occur versus what does occur.  In Ireland, if one wants to take a defamation case and the assessment deems that under the community rules it is not defamatory, the next step is to go to the Four Courts to seek injunctive relief to have the defamatory material taken down or to disclose who posted it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asks how we can find the middle ground.  It might be a duty of care situation where some form of legislation is deployed to bring it as close as possible to a provide for duty of care provisions as against the hosts without trampling on the defence and good samaritan provisions.  Unfortunately, it is a case of assessing how long a piece of string is because some are in the Facebook category and others are newly developing businesses that want to be able to avail of these defences for whatever reason.  I am not saying there is a criminal or a bad reason for that, but it might be they have no resource to moderate content and so forth.

These individuals could say this is a clear legal wrong against them and clearly defamatory, and not merely an undefined example of people being nasty to them online.  Such an individual might not have the resources to go to the Circuit Court or the High Court but they could go to an intermediate body to make that complaint.  That body would assess the complaint and order that the material be taken down after hearing from the other side, without damages being awarded.  That would operate in a similar way to the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, for example.

If there is a situation with a person who may be unable to afford to go to the courts, there are certain classifications of civil litigation that are not covered by the provisions of free legal aid.  Defamation is one of them.  It is often found that someone is either subject to an action where he or she has allegedly defamed somebody or <i>vice versa<\/i>and he or she cannot afford to bring the action.  That intermediary body - and I know the ICGAG recommended certain reforms on bodies, as did the Law Reform Commission, LRC - but a form of one-stop-shop would go a long way to fulfilling that duty to care.  I come back to the issue of bullying as raised by Deputy O'Callaghan.  It might be that somebody in that unit assesses the communication and decides there is no grounds for a report and there is nothing to see, and in the next report the assessor might decide it is a serious issue that is continual and is a harassment offence.  The assessor could then assume the shoes of the complainant and pursue the claim, which might be useful.  In that case, will the State fund the budget on that sort of function?  We have seen anecdotal evidence on what the treatment of the DPC, that regulates three quarters of global tech companies, is.  It has to be taken seriously, both from a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform point of view and from a Department of Justice and Equality perspective.

It always strikes me that the Internet is called the worldwide web, WWW, and yet we are talking about what happens here.  While Ireland is important, because we have the headquarters of many of the major tech companies here, at the same time it has to have that reach across the globe.  While I agree the issue is European from the point of view of the European Union and what we are doing about that, it goes further than that.  All of this is happening everywhere from Singapore to Latin America.  For instance, when we go on to Facebook or any of these platforms and we scroll down through our content, we come across sponsored advertising all the time.  Surely the organisations that are putting out and hosting those advertisements should also be compelled to include a certain amount of advertising about how people can report issues and about how to stand up for one's rights on this platform.

If an individual was subject to that type of activity with fake news, which has a number of different elements to it, that one-stop-shop provision could facilitate a cheaper mechanism by which those individuals could seek recourse as against the platforms, without having to go to the courts, but they would still have the right to do that as well.  The Deputy is right there is a thrust to keep the economic development online so one can put an app together and do what he or she wants with it within certain restrictions with commercial transactions.  I made this point because if the State simply makes the hosts publishers, we suddenly encounter an immediate incompatibility with the European framework and law, and there is a huge disincentive to do a lot of things.

While we can talk about European law, it is constantly under review and evolving.  I work closely with the EU in various areas, including the audio-visual media services area.  One area we are looking at is the availability of video content that is targeting children online.  There is a phenomenon known as \"dark Peppa Pig\", where people embed extreme content in videos that are being played for children who are three or four years old.  Parents put on YouTube and allow their toddlers to watch the videos.  Then, embedded in the video will be beheadings and other extreme content.  This comes from people with psychopathic or sadistic dispositions deliberately trolling children.<\/p> <p>  The debate in the EU at the moment has been along particular lines.  The thinking is that these are big data problems and, to address a point made already, the content is uploaded immediately and is, therefore, distributed or published immediately.  Effectively the mechanisms they are looking at involve getting users to flag their own content and label the user-generated content as suitable for children or otherwise.  However, if people are deliberately embedding content designed to troll children, they are not going to flag that content.  The reason those in the United Kingdom are moving towards the online harms idea is because they are facing a tsunami of problem behaviour - as are our front-line services - in terms of the negative impact of harmful content on children.  The child and adolescent mental health services in the UK are being overwhelmed by what is happening to children who are growing up in cyberspace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":764,"content":"<p>That you for that.

The point made by Mr. Lupton some minutes ago about the adequacy of responses by social media companies to a large extent is one about their mechanisms for responding to and evaluating reports.  Criminalising conduct means getting the Garda involved in some cases.  Often, it is not about achieving a criminal justice outcome.  Often, it is about people getting in touch with a social media company.  In turn, this causes the social media company to take the matter seriously and properly evaluate the content, something the company might not have done previously.  To some extent that might answer the question from Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  If there is greater Garda enforcement, we might get the desired result to take down certain material without it necessarily progressing to criminal justice enforcement.<br\/><br\/>Are there other ways of doing that?  It might be that if we can incentivise companies to act more speedily on complaints of criminal material, we can get that result.  That is permissible under the existing legal framework.  Germany has the so-called network enforcement law, or <i>netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz<\/i>, which provides for significant fines on companies that fail to take down certain types of content, including extremist content or content promoting terrorism, promptly once notified by a state body.  It is a graduated duty and it applies for the most part to firms that have more than 2 million users.  It aims not to hinder innovation in the way mentioned earlier by Deputy Conway by imposing too great a duty on smaller providers.  Essentially, it is limited to providers operating at scale.  That model could certainly be used but it is a model which, to my knowledge, has not really been considered in the Irish debate so far.  It may be premature to adopt that model now when the European landscape is so fluid at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

I am sorry to use the expression, because I do not believe self-regulation has worked the way it should have, but codes of conduct to which platform providers sign up nationally may work.  There may be some form of punishment or sanction if they fail to do things that are properly reported and adequately assigned to them by some State intervenor or actor.  We could let them sign up to that.  Ultimately, it is in their interests to come to the table with solutions and suggestions.  Maybe they have with their submissions to the committee.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that the law is in place already, as Dr. McIntyre has said.  Is it being enforced properly in a criminal context?  No, because we know there are resourcing issues.  On the civil side of the house, it is expensive and costly.  It takes time to go to court to do these things.  Fundamentally, we have only to see the recent clarification on the position in terms of hosting and content and whether injunctions can go a certain way in terms of innocent publication and so forth.  Again, it is in my witness statement but I want to underpin the point.  Really, the platforms should come to us and suggest we bring in a given model of behaviour to which they sign up and, if they do not, a sanction applies.<\/p><p>That might not be done legislatively but, rather, by way of a code of contact.  There are examples within the GDPR in the devising of future codes.  I will not get into the debate on that particular turf, but, certainly, it is up to the platform providers to show good behaviour.  There is a problem or strain in terms of the community assessment issue, where it is completely out of sync with national law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to leave the meeting for a time.

I thank the Senator for his questions and the panel for the responses.  <\/p> <p>  I have a couple of points to wrap up this discussion.  Thinking back on what happened at the previous two meetings, last week we were treated to Twitter and Facebook rules and community standards.  A number of us instanced cases to which we had been personally exposed and there was an acknowledgement that the community standards were evolving.  That is a word that was employed here earlier with respect to sites generally.  They are not fit for purpose.  That is where we are.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to replicate earlier addresses, but we are seeking to point to functional, effective regulation, with real enforceability.  How can we do this if it is not through legislation?  We are, first and foremost, legislators, something that is often overlooked.  It is our primary function in being here.  We are the lawmakers and tge legislators have failed to grapple with this issue in all the years indicated by Dr. Aiken.  The delegates have touched on this issue in responses to my colleagues, but is the objective of functional, effective regulation, with real enforceability, achievable if the platforms on the Internet are to continue to do the wonderful work they do?  They provide a service and access, as I was at pains to point out last week with the service providers.  We are honing in on harmful communications and inappropriate utilisation of the services, but it is a small part of the whole.  As it is the core of our address, quite obviously it comes to the fore.  Is it within our gift to point to regulation that does not have statutory and legislative support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#N02900","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>The problem in dealing with most social justice issues is that we cannot look at the problem space, with due respect to my learned legal colleagues, through the myopic lens of a single discipline.  Looking at a legal solution alone will not work.  Mr. Lupton spoke about good practice and conduct, but there is also an ethical and moral dimension in speaking about these very large social technology industries.  It is a question of fundamental design that must asked.  Are they now big enough to fail or not be able to self-regulate in a way?<\/p> <p>  Let us take a sociological construct.  The social media and social technology companies have been designed on the premise that greed is good and that more is better; therefore, the more connections a child has, the better.  It could be 1,000 or 2,000 across multiple platforms.  In the social sciences we have Dunbar's number.<\/p><p>It is a number that dictates the number of relationships we as humans can maintain and sustain before we begin to suffer from social stress and exhaustion, which can lead to some of those negative behaviours.  That number is 150, which is about the size of someone's Christmas card list or the number of people someone asks to one's wedding.  The question we could ask is whether we should look at structures whereby we recommend a cap on the number of connections for teens and young people who are going through developmental periods so that they do not get to that point of social stress and exhaustion where other negative behaviours can come into play.  The way that we can bring about these solutions is by taking a much broader view at governmental level, involving various Departments, to craft and architect solutions that recognise, in effect, that we are not just talking about points of law.  We are talking about children, humans and the impact on the individual and society.<\/p><p> In response to Senator Conway, these problems are uniform worldwide and, collectively, we need to come together in a transdisciplinary way to look at solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#N03000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Before I move on to Mr. Lupton and Dr. McIntyre, I wish to ask a straight question.

The first is that the law is going to shift in any event in terms of the e-commerce package.  The committee may need to do very little other than to lay a statutory instrument before the House in the usual way for secondary legislation to come through.<\/p> <p>  The second point is in response to the question on whether we can achieve our ends without legislating.  I think the answer is \"No\".  Part 3 of my witness statement deals with a number of civil and criminal statutes that are out of date and they need to be overhauled in terms of language, offences and remedies such as civil applications and sanctions.  Unfortunately, there is no avoiding that job of work.  In response to the Chairman's question, we do not need to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but, to take up Dr. McIntyre's earlier point, if the law that is on the Statute Book was enforced and resources were given to the agents of the State to do what they do so well, but with additional learning and resources, we might be better as a society if we just deployed what is there.  There is that conundrum between upgrading and updating and then enforcing what is on the Statute Book and enabling the Garda.<\/p> <p>  There has been a sea change in the Garda force since the new Commissioner came in, and there is a new impetus in respect of education and training.  It will be good to see garda&iacute; who do the beat on the street also able to grapple with these issues on the doorsteps.  I am sorry for harping back to the LRC report and the ICGAG report, but there is a space for the State to intervene to provide a one-stop shop by means of civil recourse.  It will never be criminal recourse, but it may assist funnelling to State agencies to deal with criminal sanctions in the form of a digital safety commissioner or a national Internet safety advisory group, an actual body set up on a statutory basis with a commissioner or set of commissioners that could then bring in codes of conduct or we could have a legislative basis for codes of conduct to bring the platforms to the table and say: \"Your community standards do not work lads.  We need to fix them.\"  I am sorry for being colloquial in my expression.  That is how we could go.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman's question is a very good one.  We could enforce the current laws, let the legislators work on updating those laws insofar as they are not incompatible with the European frameworks.  Going back to Senator Conway's question, the Oireachtas can work as hard as it can, centrally, to make sure that the package that comes forward on the e-commerce side suits and is fit for purpose, without interfering with the good parts of the Internet.  I know that is a problem.  There are good parts.  I hope, then, we will have societal change.  Unfortunately, legislation takes time and that is the reality of it.

One is content, which amounts to a criminal offence at the moment, and we know the answer to that is some reform of the criminal law, greater resources for the enforcement of the criminal law and greater work on the international co-operation and investigation elements.<br\/><br\/>The second is the area of civil harms in the form of, for example, defamation and invasion of privacy.  We again have a consensus that the answer to that is to a large extent going to be greater enforcement by technology firms of the law when abuses are brought to their attention and ensuring greater access to justice by individuals who, for example, are defamed, although we have no consensus how that might be done in a cost-effective way.<br\/><br\/>The third area is wider.  It is probably one that is at the heart of a lot of this discussion, although perhaps it has been unspoken throughout today's proceedings, that is, the question of content that is not in any in breach of the law but is simply toxic, nasty and unpleasant.  The answer to that to a large extent is not to deploy the law.  There is a problem in that, speaking as a lawyer and in the context of the legislative process, when one's only tool is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail and it comes naturally to think about legislative solutions.  To a large extent, the answer to dealing with unpleasant environments in the online space will be to address what encourages them to persist.  Technology firms predominantly operate on the basis of a profit motive and as long as they allow content on their sites that is unpleasant and they profit from engagement with that, they will continue to do it.  The technology industry for the most part is funded through advertising and very often a solution will be for individuals to approach advertisers and say they do not want to use their product or to be associated with them if they are going to continue to prop up that unpleasant environment.  That has been very effective in the United Kingdom in the context of the tabloids where a lot of the very unpleasant elements of tabloid culture, for example, some of the casual racism and the abuse of privacy of individuals - elements which are largely without legal sanction - have been toned down by boycotts of advertisers where people have said, &quot;Enough is enough&quot;, and they do not want to support that unpleasantness in <i>The Sun<\/i>, for example, anymore and until it stops they will boycott advertisers who deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019101600002#O01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

To put a little bit of context to this, we have received correspondence and some lobbying from various organisations and individuals on the issue of corporate ownership.  People fear that it will become similar to the situation with Boots pharmacies or a fast food type of situation where a whole lot of veterinary practices around the country will be owned by a company which would primarily be interested in profit and would probably concentrate on the aspects of veterinary practice which are most profitable and leave the others.  From the committee's perspective in looking after the interests of farmers and the primary producer, we are talking about the larger animals such as when a cow is calving or a sheep is out at night that needs assistance and a vet cannot be got.  In many areas of rural Ireland there is already a problem with that and if we went down the route that is feared with the corporate ownership creeping into the situation, there would be great fears for many people in the farming community that this would happen.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a few questions on that.  Ms Muldoon outlined in her opening statement that one of the Veterinary Council of Ireland's key responsibilities is to ensure that duties are performed in accordance with prescribed codes of professional conduct and ethics.  In the context of vets who are employees of a company which is not the vet, I would like to get detail on how the council expects to be able to make sure that happens, to make sure the control is there and how the council would find that.<\/p> <p>  In referring to the background, Ms Muldoon said that \"Historically, section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice,\" but that legal advice told the council otherwise.  When was that and at what stage was that advice received?  Later on Ms Muldoon stated that the council went into a consultation process and said the Veterinary Council of Ireland has benefitted from legal advice on the matter.  I assume that is separate legal advice since then.  Can we get the details of that legal advice?  What is the situation with that?<\/p> <p>  On the practices that have already been bought by companies, and I understand that some companies from Britain have come here and bought practices, how many of them have they bought?  Is that vision of chains of practices starting to develop?  Are they focusing on a particular type of practice?  My understanding is they are focusing on the small animals and equine practices and that they are not as interested in the other practices that would be more general for the farming community out there.  The fear that people have is that if that will be the focus and if a veterinary practice or partnership sells off a portion of its practice to a company, it is selling off the portion that is most profitable and the other part of it that is not so profitable will end up going into decline.  Therefore, we will see a situation where the farming community, which needs a service, which deserves a service and for which the Veterinary Council of Ireland is responsible for ensuring that a service is provided, will see that slip.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of partnerships versus limited companies, my understanding is that many veterinary practices became limited companies years ago.  For the last 20 years many of them have been limited companies.  There is nothing wrong with that and that has gone on, and yet the Veterinary Council of Ireland is saying that section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005 prevented it from happening or was interpreted in a way that prevented it from happening.  I do not get that.  If, until recently, the Veterinary Council of Ireland thought there could not be companies then why were there companies?  That is a simple question.<\/p> <p>  Nobody has a problem with a vet or a number of vets setting up a limited company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#A00100","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I remind members to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system.

For 2019, the budget of &euro;291 million for the Department comprises &euro;153 million in current expenditure and &euro;138 million in capital expenditure.<\/p> <p>  As requested, the committee has been provided with information on the expenditure by my Department to the end of September 2019, and the position is very positive.  The total gross spend by my Department at the end of September was &euro;190 million.  This sum comprises &euro;120 million in current expenditure and &euro;70 million in capital expenditure.  This overall level of spend for the end of September is as planned at the start of the year.  Current expenditure is at 97% of profile and capital expenditure is at 105% of profile.  Since the end of September, there has been a further spend of more than &euro;10 million, with &euro;5.2 million in capital expenditure and &euro;5.2 million in current expenditure.  This brings the total expenditure to date to just over &euro;200 million.<\/p> <p>  Capital spend is &euro;75 million at this point, which when compared with a spend of &euro;28 million at the same point last year clearly shows the progress made by my Department in terms of the delivery of our capital programmes and the timely drawdown of funding by local authorities and others.  It also demonstrates that we are on track to continue the strong expenditure performance achieved last year, and to again ensure that the resources provided to my Department are fully used to the benefit of communities across the country.<\/p> <p>  Regarding rural development, one of the key areas of progress in 2019 has been the ramping up of the LEADER programme.  I am pleased that both project approvals and spend have increased strongly this year.  At this stage project approvals stand at &euro;90 million, with a further &euro;25 million worth of projects going through the approval process.  I expect, therefore, that by the end of 2019, 80% of the &euro;164 million allocated for project approvals will be approved.  The balance will be approved before the end of 2020 and the projects will have up to three years to draw down payments.  Almost 2,500 LEADER projects have been approved and are progressing across the country.  They are contributing to the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  They will ensure a strong flow of investment in rural Ireland at a time it needs it most, not least to protect against the uncertainty of Brexit.  In terms of spend in 2019, while I initially allocated &euro;30 million to the programme, expenditure stands at &euro;33 million.  Given this strong performance, I have allocated an additional &euro;10 million to the programme.  This is being reallocated from savings that are likely to materialise under the RRDF. <\/p> <p>  With regard to this fund, while I have reallocated the &euro;10 million to the LEADER programme, progress with the fund has been strong.  A total of 84 projects have been approved for funding with 38 projects under category 1 and 46 projects under category 2.  As many as 62 projects have completed the required procurement processes and are being delivered.  To date, 24 of these projects have drawn down some funding with the spend to date standing at &euro;11.1 million.  Given the fact that so many projects are being delivered and making claims, I expect a strong outturn from this programme in 2019. <\/p> <p>  While the LEADER programme and the RRDF represent the biggest rural programme areas by expenditure level, I would like to emphasise the continued importance of the other rural programme areas.  The town and village renewal scheme, Ceantair Laga &Aacute;rd-Riachtanais, CL&Aacute;R, the walks scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, ORIS, and the local improvement scheme are having positive impacts on rural areas throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>While we need large-scale strategic investment, such as that provided under the RRDF and LEADER, we also need to ensure that every town, village and rural area can benefit from funding for their economic and social development.  We have built up a very strong pipeline of capital projects across these schemes, as a result of which expenditure is very strong.  To date, &euro;9.8 million has been spent under the town and village renewal scheme; &euro;8.7 million under the national rural development schemes; and &euro;5.6 million under local improvement schemes.  Each of these areas will see a full spend in 2019.<\/p><p> Regarding programme B, community development, as the committee will be aware, the two most significant programmes in expenditure terms are the community services programme, CSP, and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.<\/p><p> The community services programme provides financial support to community organisations to deliver local services through a social enterprise model.  The funding supports the cost of employing a manager or a specific number of full-time equivalents.  The CSP is a vital resource for a range of community organisations.  It provides supports for staff in community halls.  It supports the provision of vital services in disadvantaged areas.  It also supports organisations that provide employment for those most distant from the labour market, including people with disabilities, Travellers and ex-prisoners.  The allocation for 2019 is &euro;46 million and to date, &euro;42.6 million of this has been spent.  Overall, the CSP is assisting more than 400 organisations by providing a contribution for more than 1,900 positions.<\/p><p> The social inclusion and community activation programme provides funding to help individuals and communities in our society who are experiencing disadvantage.  It aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through local engagement and partnerships between individuals and community organisations.  In particular, it seeks to assist a range of disadvantaged groups, including lone parents, persons with disabilities, the long-term unemployed, Roma and Travellers.  This programme area has an allocation of &euro;43.2 million, with spend to date at &euro;41.4 million.  Like the CSP, this is a vital resource for those individuals most in need and for the organisations working to help them and their communities.<\/p><p> The Department also operates a range of smaller community development programmes and schemes.  As I noted earlier in respect of rural development, while the funding may be smaller, the impact on people and communities is very important.  The senior alerts scheme has reached a further 13,000 people so far this year.  This is similar to the numbers last year and means that a total of 55,000 people have now been funded under the scheme.  It is having a positive impact on older people and delivers benefits to them and to society.  It enables many older people to live in their own homes with greater peace of mind.<\/p><p> The community enhancement programme has also been very successful again this year.  It provides capital funding for communities across Ireland to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas.  Under the 2019 programme, more than 2,000 communities and community groups benefited from funding of &euro;4.5 million, with local decision-making ensuring money is put to use where it is needed most.<\/p><p> Given the topic of today's committee meeting, my opening statement has focused on my Department's expenditure position and the impact of some of the programmes we fund.  As I said, the position is very positive, with all our programme areas progressing well and expenditure on target.<\/p><p> Before closing, I also wish to mention briefly our work on policy and strategy development.  Over the past two years we have published a number of strategies and policies, including the public libraries strategy, Our Public Libraries 2022; the National Social Enterprise Policy for Ireland 2019-2020; and Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities, the five-year strategy running from 2019 until 2024 to support the community and voluntary sector.  These strategies have been developed in partnership with the key stakeholders and with a strong focus on public consultation.  This means that the policies and strategies we develop reflect the views of those working on the ground and that the implementation of the objectives and actions will have real benefits for communities and individuals.  We are also working on a volunteering strategy, with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, chairing a group on that work.  We are developing a new rural development policy.  This will build on the success of the Action Plan for Rural Development.  Again, consultation is key to this work, with events held around the country to allow inputs from communities to this policy.<\/p><p> My Department's mission is now more important than ever before, given the many challenges communities and individuals face.  In this context it is important we take stock and consult with our stakeholders and the public to continue to inform the strategic direction of the Department.  This will help to ensure we put our funding to best use and that our programmes and schemes continue to have a positive impact on communities throughout the country.<\/p><p> I would welcome any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#B00200","speaker":"1500","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":853,"content":"<p>We will just concentrate on programme B to start.

I can see in County Clare the positive impact it has on communities on the ground.  I note that during the year the Minister called to Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare, and highlighted the good work being done there through the community services programme as operated by Obair.  I am often asked by community organisations whether there is a possibility of expanding the community services programme even further to make it available to other communities that cannot necessarily avail of it at present.  I know that the Minister carried out a review of the programme.  Has the review thrown up any more recommendations to expand the programme where possible?

I wish to make it clear to the Chairman and the committee that we make a very substantial contribution.  As I said, 400 communities throughout the country are being supported and approximately 1,900 staff are employed.  With the allocation I have secured this year I am looking to see whether I can get more services into the programme.  It is a very good programme that services rural Ireland in particular.  Services are provided particularly to communities that would not previously have had them.  The State might not have been able to provide them, the council might not have been able to provide them, and the health board might not have been able to provide them if we did not have the community services programme.  That is why I am carrying out a review at present.  It is probably why we did the social enterprise policy as well.  Some of the social enterprises are doing very well.  They put the profits they make back into their enterprises.  Some of these programmes, such as the community services programme, will never be profit-making, but at the same time we need to give them the support, backup and resources they need to keep them alive because they provide excellent services.  I am carrying out a review in this regard.  I hope to be able to support a few more organisations next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#C00300","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

I acknowledge also that this is a relatively new Department - only two years old - and that from a standing start the Minister has managed to increase the budget by over 26% in 2019 to a total of &euro;291 million across the various programmes.  This needs to be acknowledged because it is hard-fought-for with other Departments.  This committee has a special interest in rural communities and disadvantaged communities, and the funding the Minister has captured for those communities must be acknowledged and welcomed.  I wanted to put that on the public record and to thank him for it.<\/p> <p>  Programme B concerns the community enhancement programmes, disadvantaged communities, SICAP and social inclusion.  How can we ensure full expenditure by year end?<\/p><p>The Minister has given broad figures up to the end of September but funding is still available until the end of December.  Are there enough applications in the pipeline to spend the full amount for which the Minister has budgeted in 2019 for the various communities around the country?  I acknowledge the increase in numbers under the seniors alert scheme.  We often hear of rural isolation and increasing its reach by more than 13,000 people is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> Are the applications improving in quality?  When schemes were new, some of the applicant bodies were not up to speed with their terms and conditions.  Are many applications being rejected because of a lack of quality?  Some community groups have been before the committee and they were concerned by the time and effort that needed to be put into preparing applications.  Most of these bodies are voluntary and comprise people who, while having vast experience, give of their time on a voluntary basis to improve their communities.  I am concerned that bureaucracy could get in the way of good applications.  If there are issues with the quality of applications, we need to provide a resource to assist communities to improve them, so that we get the best value for money and that the funding benefits the communities and reaches them in the best possible way.<\/p><p> What barriers or problems exist for some communities in accessing finance?  Some communities are better at this than others and some repeat applicants know the system very well.  Some disadvantaged communities, however, may not have the same capacity to make quality applications and we need to help them with resources and assistance, so that they can benefit from the funding the Minister is providing.  They may not have the same number of volunteers or other resources and we should identify them and assist them.  Partnership groups around the country do this but we need to constantly evaluate the success of the schemes so that we can reach out to the communities which really need the funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#C00800","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":861,"content":"<p>The community enhancement programme and community services programme come from current expenditure and the spend will be drawn down.  The Senator made an observation that I made after being Minister for only a short time.  He is correct that some organisations have professionals who can put in applications on their behalf but others, which do professional work, do not have the same support so do not get the funding they should.  In response to this, I asked my officials to go around the country to Helping Hands events, which were designed to help and support organisations in filling in applications.  I could name six or seven groups in every county that come in on every single scheme and draw down from every pot but I could also name groups in west Mayo, north Mayo, north Kerry or north Sligo that did not get the opportunity, even though they are doing more valuable work than some of the others that are good at putting in the applications.  We are working on it and I compliment my officials on meeting organisations around the country, for which the latter were grateful.  A lot of groups do not know what funding is available so the Helping Hands events were very good for them.<\/p> <p>  The current funding will be drawn down and nothing will be left.  In fact, we are looking for more in respect of both programmes.  I can be critical of local authorities but I must be fair to them as well.  For a good few years during the recession, there were no schemes and local authorities did not realise there would be continuation when the new Department was set up.  I met county managers, outlined the expenditure over the next number of years and told them about the schemes so most local authorities make better applications now.  One of the unfair criticisms the Department gets all the time, which also happens in respect of the LEADER programme and local authorities, relates to capital works funding.  Some of these schemes take between 12 and 15 months to build.  I could have been stricter than I previously was with regard to planning but, from now, I am not allowing further rural regeneration scheme applications unless they have full planning.  There is no point giving funding to an organisation only for it to find that it has been refused planning permission or there is an objection and, two years later, they cannot spend the money.  I am being stricter in allocating money now but there is a big improvement in spend.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cowen was derogatory about the Department in his speech on the budget but his own county received &euro;16 million, &euro;2 million of which has not been drawn down.  He would be better off asking his local authority why it did not spend that allocation.  The investment the county got was very welcome, nonetheless, as it is in every county.  This Department is working well, though, like every Department, it takes a while to bed down.  What has happened in the Department in the past two years, however, has been exceptional.  It has worked under difficult conditions and while every other Minister had a Secretary General in an established Department to meet, we did not even have an office.  We were expected to function and we did that.  It is a fantastic Department with a fantastic team and fantastic commitment.  Whoever is in government next, the Department has to be left in place because people are happy with its expenditure and with what is happening.  They want the Department and its funding to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#D00200","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I have a few comments and questions on programme B.  I wish to emphasise the importance of the community services programme, into which I understand a review is under way.  In my local area, there is no shop in Kilbride, which is a rural area just outside Roscommon town, so the programme has stepped in and is providing a community shop through Pobal, which is hugely successful.  Other groups are looking to the example of Kilbride for other rural areas.  It is important for the people it serves.<\/p> <p>  Another important service funded through the programme is Triest Press Printing, which is located in Roscommon town and supports people with disabilities to engage in work.  They are busy providing this very important service for people in the area.  I attended an event in Castlerea last Monday with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The social inclusion and community activation plan, SICAP, and the Ability programme are examples of cross-departmental work that supports people with disabilities to get the training and supports they need to re-enter the workforce.  At the event, 14 people, who have great ability but who need a little bit more support, received certificates.<\/p><p>In his opening statement the Minister spoke about looking at the impact of the Department's work, but this has a real impact in supporting people with disabilities to re-enter the workforce, thanks to SICAP and others working cross-departmentally.<\/p><p> I refer to the community services programme, from which we are all keen for more groups to benefit.  When is the review of the programme likely to be completed?<\/p><p> In the context of programme B, the senior alert scheme has proved to be hugely successful since it became easier for people to apply for it.  As my background is in occupational therapy, I know of the importance of the scheme to people across the country.  It is important both for the people who use the alert system and their families who want to support them to live as independently as possible for as long as possible.  I am getting this feedback from community groups and individuals across the area I represent in counties Roscommon and Galway and the response to what the Department and the Minister are delivering to the area is usually positive.  I have mostly made comments rather than asking questions, but I would like to know when the review of the community services programme is likely to be completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#D00300","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I will start with the review.  Indecon is undertaking a review of the programme.  I want to protect it, but I am afraid that weaker groups will be left behind.  As I need to protect them, we will have to wait and see.  The review of the programme will show whether we are getting value for money and what we can do to improve it.  I also want to support social enterprises, which is why we have a national social enterprise policy for the first time since the foundation of the State.  I need to protect the weaker groups in the programme, in particular, such as those some people might not think provide value for money.  They might say someone else should be running them, but we do not have anyone else to do so and need them to continue.  The Senator asked a straight question, to which I will give her a straight answer.  The review will be completed by the end of the year.  I want to make it clear that I intend to protect the groups that need to be protected.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also spoke about the senior alert scheme.  When I took office, there was a public outcry as there had been an underspend under the scheme for many years.  I made a decision to bring in Pobal and we ran an advertising and media campaign to notify all voluntary groups about the scheme.  The senior alert scheme is now too successful, as I have had to find extra funding for it for the last two years.  I welcome this because it is only right to do so.  Some 55,000 people now participate in the scheme, including 13,000 new participants in 2019 and 20,000 in 2018.  The scheme has received an allocation of over &euro;2.3 million and I also had to find a further &euro;1.6 million in funding.  We have spent &euro;3.7 million under the scheme to date.  It is a great scheme which gives people peace of mind.  Many people now participate in it and we have to monitor it on a regular basis to ensure we modernise equipment as we move along and support elderly people.  What is most important is keeping them safe in their homes.  The programme has worked very well and I am pleased with it.<\/p> <p>  The community services programme, CSP, of which I spoke, is also a great programme and I wish I had more money for it in order to have more groups and better organisation.  However, SICAP, the best programme of them all, receives the least attention, support and credit.  I am trying to increase its yearly funding as it deals with the most marginalised on a one-to-one basis.  We conducted a review and I made it easier for SICAP participants to run their business on a one-to-one basis.  The level of success we have had with the programme is unbelievable, particularly for people on the margins such as those who had been in prison, who were not educated, or who needed job support.  The number of people coming through the programme is incredible.  It supports over 2,200 communities and 27,000 individuals, but it would be worth it even for one individual.  I have been in Limerick, Dublin, Tallaght, and many other places throughout the country and the programme does not get the credit it deserves.  I wish I had more funding for it because it deals with the most marginalised  I have received a small increase in the budget.  Giving an increase to SICAP participants throughout the country is one possibility I will look into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#E00200","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  It is ironic that we are here while a discussion on the systematic destruction of the community development and anti-poverty and equality movement is ongoing upstairs in the AV room.  They are discussing community development and how it has been destroyed during the years.  I do not mean to take from the various schemes, grants and moneys that are moved here and there.  However, I disagree with the Minister on SICAP.  Some good work is being done, but SICAP replaced the social inclusion programme which had much better quality measures and fantastic initiatives all around the country before the concept of activation was brought into it.  We have lost much of the intelligence and even some of the pilot projects that were conducted on many of the social issues at the time.  The Minister and I will have to disagree in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that a review of the CSP is being conducted, which the Minister has indicated will be completed by the end of the year.  Will the recommendations be made public and, if so, when?  I ask because many CSP schemes are finding it very difficult just to meet their overheads due to having to pay the national minimum wage and meet the increasing price of insurance and so on.  I ask the Minister to let them know where they stand as soon as possible.  One cannot operate a programme while always wondering whether one can switch on the lights or afford the little things.  One cannot be strategic and focused in the work one needs to do while worrying about next week's bills.  The sooner the review is completed, the better and it is important that the recommendations be made public.  In the interim, I ask the Minister to examine the ability of some CSPs to pay the national minimum wage.  He knows about the issues in the insurance industry and the problems these groups face which we are trying to tackle in many ways.  We are hoping to pass legislation before Christmas that may help, but what the insurance companies are demanding from some of the groups is bonkers.  We need to meet their needs in some way.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions about the budget.  Some 550,700 social inclusion units were profiled and there has been a 1% spend.  The obvious question is why only 1% has been spent at this stage in the year.  How is that issue going to be addressed?  <\/p> <p>  My other question relates to the dormant account measures.  I am sure there is a logical explanation but why was nothing profiled for it?  Brexit will have implications for the PEACE programme, but we are hopeful we will achieve a deal in the next 24 hours.<\/p><p>Has an agreement in this regard been reached by the Irish and UK Governments in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  I have questions on the other measures but the Minister might address those matters first.<\/p><p> As to whether different programmes are targeting the right people, there is confusion about the criteria and what programme meets which criteria.  Are all allocations to these programmes based on strict criteria or are political decisions made in respect of the allocations?  Are there predetermined criteria or is there political influence in how the allocations are made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#E00300","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator that, regardless of whether there is a deal or no deal, the PEACE programme will continue.

It will probably be needed more than ever if there is no deal.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned a review of the community services programme.  The latter is being reviewed to provide reassurance to various groups.  I want to protect the groups that need protection.  The Senator knows about that more than anybody else because she was involved in the community sector.  Work is being done in north Mayo and in places like that where if it were not for the community services programme, services would not be provided.  The Government and the Department part-fund the groups.  Last year, I noted a difficulty in meeting the minimum wage payment.  I had an equalisation fund and diverted &euro;1 million from it.  I did not ask anybody to submit applications.  I met representatives from Pobal, which had assessed the programmes and had all the relevant information.  Where groups had money in the bank, we did not have to support them.  We supported the weaker groups.  I allocated &euro;1 million to the groups that needed it most.  We have the Helping Hands information sessions.  The Senator referred to the groups who need the money most.  There are groups that are very good at getting professional help in the context of completing forms but I do not like that in terms of the securing of funding.  Rather, I want to give the money to the people who need it most.  I try to target money where it is needed most.  That is why I got my departmental officials together with representatives of Pobal to go out and talk to the groups.  It is one good initiative we did in the Department.  We had big audiences at all the venues where the meetings were held.   People got feedback on schemes and help in filling application forms.  As in the case of Mayo, without even glancing at the funding allocated when I get the details from Pobal, I could nearly name the first five or six on the list, but that is not right.  That is not what the schemes are about, rather they are about giving the money to the groups that need it most.  However, we must also recognise the groups that are doing well, that have savings, those that are able to manage their programmes and that have been able to secure some funding.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  We need some of the groups to be doing well in order that we can support the ones that are not doing so well.  The reason I called for the review is because I need to protect the programme.  I want people to know that this review is not designed to try to get rid of anybody.  Rather, it is to ensure that we are getting the best value for money, that the money is being targeted where it is needed and that there is no waste in the scheme.  The Senator and I know of places in Mayo where if it were not for the community service programme and the allocation of funding of &euro;19,000 for the salary of an employee and &euro;32,000 for the salary of an manager, there would not be a scheme in place.  I provided for an allocation from the equalisation fund to meet the minimum wage for those employed in these schemes last year.  I look at that again this year to see if there is anything I can do.  We do not pay the full salary for these people.  I have a decision to make in the next few days regarding the bringing in of more groups in order to provide them with an opportunity to develop.  If I have to deal with meeting the minimum wage for these people, I will not be able to bring in more groups.  There are organisations that want to develop and that want to enter the programme.  There are also organisations that need some support.  I have to look at ways and means to support them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about the dormant account measures.  I am looking at ways to provide support where there is a need in communities, where groups are not able to get funding from schemes that are in place.  That is the reason I set up specified schemes.  The Senator mentioned the social innovation fund.  We allocated &euro;5 million to it and &euro;2 million to the social enterprise development fund.  Such funding is to give groups an opportunity to develop programmes.  The scheme with respect to the Dormant Accounts Fund is not the easiest to administer.  I must have the funding in my budget line and draw it down from Government after that which creates a problem.  It would be better if I could have the funding and spend it and then draw down from the fund but that is not the way it works.  I must have the funding in my budget line, I must negotiate it even though when we spent the money we get it back from the Government.  If there is &euro;30 million of &euro;40 million in the fund, we cannot simply spend it.  I must have the funding in my budget line and other Departments get their share of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  While my Department administers the respective scheme, in some cases we do not have control over where the funding goes.  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills and other Departments have their respective schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#F00200","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":868,"content":"<p>The Minister might deal with the social inclusion units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#F00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>We have 13 social inclusion units.

Because of the weather we had last year and everything else, I made a conscious decision for this year to make money available for the local improvement scheme, LIS, at the end of the year.  I allocated &euro;10 million nationally to the local authorities in February; we are almost at the end of October and to date, only &euro;5.6 million has been spent.  To be honest, I am disappointed.  They asked for the money early and I did that.  If I give it late, they complain that they have not time to do it.  I gave them the money and made a special effort this year to get the funding out to them so that when they are doing whatever tarring programme or works they are undertaking in whatever area, they could also do the LIS.  It is very hard for me to give them more money when to date they have only drawn down &euro;5.6 million of &euro;10 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#G00200","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":881,"content":"<p>That is very disappointing about the local improvement scheme.  It is a wonderful scheme, which the Minister reopened some years ago for which he is due huge credit.  Local authorities who have not pulled their weight in this regard should be named and shamed.  I, and the committee, want to know what local authorities are performing well in this and which have spent their allocations.  It is just not good enough that the Minister and his Department would allocate &euro;10 million to upgrade minor roads in rural Ireland but that local authorities have not managed to spend the money.  Those local authorities that have performed well should be rewarded for that.  That is something the Minster could consider in future.<\/p> <p>  Programme A pertains to rural development and regional affairs.  It is the Department's biggest spending element.  The establishment of the rural regeneration and development fund was a game changer for rural Ireland.  It gives those communities a chance to get big money.  I am thinking in this regard of Lahinch, County Clare, which received &euro;2.86 million last year in the second round of funding.  A significant amount of that work was completed prior to the hosting of the Irish Open in Lahinch.  It was a wonderful showcase for north Clare, for County Clare as a whole and for the mid-west.  It is a testament to that particular fund and shows how the funding can be used for the benefit of the whole community.  I am looking forward to work being completed on Lahinch Seaworld as part of the application.  Going back over to east Clare, to Lough Derg and Holy Island &euro;920,000 was allocated to that programme under the rural regeneration fund.  Much work is ongoing there.  Holy Island will complement the blueway that has been developed along Lough Derg and will act as a magnet to bring visitors from County Clare back over to east Clare.  That fund is hugely significant.  County Clare benefited from a &euro;1 million injection to the digital hub in Ennistymon.  I understand that project is nearing completion and I look forward to it opening in the near future.  Perhaps the Minister will come to Ennistymon and perform the duty himself.  It was one of the first projects to benefit under the rural regeneration and development fund.  <\/p> <p>  I compliment Leonard Cleary in Clare County Council, Urban McMahon, and Pat Dowling, the chief executive, who have driven this particular project.  The LEADER programme is well established in County Clare and is to the forefront.  I wish to compliment Doir&iacute;n Graham, Gloria Callinan and all the LEADER team there.  <\/p> <p>  I note the Minister has reallocated &euro;10 million to LEADER, which is welcome.  In County Clare, money is running out and several projects that still are in the pipeline might benefit from an injection of money.  The Minister will top up LEADER companies that have performed well, which is the correct approach.  Consider the job that is under way in the Tradaree Arms in the main street in Newmarket on Fergus, where &euro;1.2 million is going into the redevelopment of that building to provide a training area for chefs, a food hub, a meals-on-wheels operation, as well as a place for the youth of the village.  This wonderful project, in the middle of the street, is made possible by LEADER funding, by Obair and by the local community.  I look forward to that project nearing completion.  That is the significance of LEADER.  <\/p> <p>  Kilmihil, County Clare, was recently awarded &euro;200,000 to develop an AstroTurf ground in the village.  This is a wonderful community organisation.  It is the first time they have been in receipt of major moneys from the State.  It is another case of LEADER delivering on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  I am involved in my local Tidy Towns organisation in Clarecastle.  This year our points increased significantly, by 13.  A meeting held in Power's pub was a celebration because of the community effort across Clarecastle from the young and not so young.  The Tidy Towns competition is the best example of community development, pride in community and of improving public space.  I encourage the Minister to support the Tidy Towns movement and the competition to an even greater degree in future years.<\/p> <p>  We touched on the local improvement scheme.  I also compliment the Western Development Commission on the work it is doing.  The Minister might come back to me on the issues I have raised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#G00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I will get my officials to send the Chairman and the committee an up-to-date list of who has drawn down what in the LIS and how much they were allocated since February.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is correct; the rural regeneration scheme is a game changer.  It will give communities the opportunity, particularly with digital hubs, food hubs and different projects where there would be an allocation from other organisations.  When I came in as Minister, I spoke to the Minister of Finance and I must give him great credit.  He asked me what was the one thing we needed and I said it was funds where, sometimes bodies received funds from local authorities, LEADER or from other organisations but they needed an injection of big money to complete a project.  That is why the rural regeneration scheme and the urban regeneration scheme were set up.  I am aware that it can take some time to get some of the schemes up and running.  We have to be careful and carry out due diligence to ensure that the schemes which are allocated funding are done properly in the first instance.  We must protect taxpayers' money and we must ensure that everything is in order.  These organisations are getting substantial amounts of money.  I am pleased with the way that the scheme is working.  I am aware of a scheme in County Clare that I intend to visit in the coming weeks.  We also have responsibility for the library there.  We give substantial funding to Ennis library and we need to turn the sod on that.<\/p> <p>  The rural regeneration scheme has been receiving applications since August and will be making announcements in the next few weeks.  Other Departments have one round, we are coming into our second round.  This scheme has various categories.  Category 1 is for the big projects that are ready to go.  We have made a few changes this time, and now they have to have planning and be more ready to go than the previous occasion.  Category 2 enables people to draw down funding to get a scheme ready.<\/p><p>Both of them are working very well.  There are some fantastic projects being developed around the country at the moment.  When this is over, we will be able to say that various projects were completed under the rural regeneration scheme and people will see that we have gotten value for money and created lots of jobs.  I see it happening everywhere.  <\/p><p> On LEADER, we conducted an analysis of the programme and decided to give a further &euro;5 million to the LEADER companies.  To be honest, I could have just given a bit to everybody but that would have been wrong because some of them are performing very well but others are not performing so well.  I have put criteria in place in terms of spend and allocation and my officials administer that.  It is a very fair system and I did not get involved in it.  I have now decided that we will look at the top ten and reward them.  The Chairman has said that his LEADER company is okay, but I will also be looking at the ones at the bottom at the end of the year.  If I think there will not be a spend under the programme, I will reallocate some of that money to those that are spending.  This is Government money and European money that is available to communities and it should be spent.  Some of the companies are doing fantastically well but others are not doing so well.  I have heard a lot of criticism of the LEADER programme but my Department can only allocate the funds; it is up to the companies to complete the projects.  I cannot give money to projects that are not completed.  I cannot hand money over because at the end of the day, I am responsible.  I am answerable to this committee and my Department is answerable to Europe with regard to that funding.  When the spot checks come, if everything is not in order, then we have a problem.  We have had problems in the past and there is no point in pretending that we have not.  This year's budget allocation is &euro;30 million but I will need substantially more and I will have to take that from the schemes where the money allocated may not be spent.  I am glad to see it ramping up and going so well.<\/p><p> We have spoken previously about the Tidy Towns scheme which is also working very well.  I am delighted that for the third year in a row, I have been able to provide &euro;1.4 million for the scheme.  I am the first Minister in the first Government to reward the Tidy Towns competition.  We did it on a town, village and city basis.  Funding for Tidy Towns and for the shows has gone down really well with the voluntary groups that do immense voluntary work for their county and country.  It is only a \"\"thank you\" to them.  It is not big money but it keeps the shows going and it gives a focus to the Tidy Towns committees.  We had 918 entries this year, which is fantastic.  I attended the awards ceremony in the Helix and saw the positivity and excitement of those who work for their communities.  We are so lucky in this country to have so many people doing voluntary work.  That said, I do not know why so many people choose to spoil our countryside, towns and villages.  I do not know why they cannot do what the voluntary sector does, by way of the Tidy Towns committees, instead of throwing their rubbish out of their cars and throwing their chip bags on the ground at night.  There is a lot of talk about climate change and I hope when people are out at night that they think about the environment, about their communities and about what other people have to do to clean up their mess.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#G00400","speaker":"1500","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":884,"content":"<p>Well said.

Such funding is certainly welcome in the many communities that benefit from it, whether through the LEADER scheme, the rural regeneration scheme, town and village renewal scheme, the CL&Aacute;R programme, the walk schemes, local improvement schemes and Tidy Towns.  Every single county and community in the country is touched by funding from these schemes.  It is important to constantly evaluate their success and ensure that we are getting value for money from them.  I listened with interest to the Minister's comments about how some applicant bodies like local authorities or LEADER companies are better than others.  We must develop and progress those bodies that are not performing as well as they should be because when they are not performing well, it is the communities that suffer.  The Minister knows that and I welcome the fact that his Department intends to focus on it going forward.  As I said earlier, it is a concern of mine.  Communities depend a lot on expertise being made available to them through voluntary effort and some are better than others at providing that volunteerism.  We really need to assist those that are lagging behind because these are the communities that need assistance the most.  That is something that we all need to continually work on in terms of how the various schemes are working.<\/p><p>In the context of the rural regeneration fund, I wish to mention a couple of projects in my own county of Waterford in an effort to gauge the level of ambition expected of applicants.  This is not a criticism but in last year's allocation, Waterford did not do particularly well.  I suspect that the applicant bodies themselves will admit that they were not up to speed in terms of the ambition expected by the Minister and the Department.  I have had this discussion with them and have met them since then.  There are two very ambitious projects from Waterford under rural regeneration which deserve a mention.  I am not asking the Minister to comment on them because I understand that departmental officials are assessing applications at the moment.  One of them is in west Waterford, the Blackwater Valley application which is a unique collaboration involving LEADER, the local authority and five communities.  Five different villages in west county Waterford are aiming to create an economic development zone in rural west Waterford.  It is a very ambitious project which is seeking a lot of funding but if it is successful it will have a real impact in every one of those villages.  I like the fact that it is a collaborative effort, with the villages working together to try to bring up the whole west county Waterford area.  They are not trying to do it individually, in their own silos.  They are actually leaning on each other, sharing expertise and sharing each other's unique assets to make it a more attractive proposition overall in terms of enterprise, tourism and rural development.  It includes the villages of Cappoquin, Lismore, Tallow, Aglish and Villierstown.  The project is very ambitious and the application submitted seeks funding in the order of &euro;5 million.  In his statement announcing the rural regeneration scheme, the Minister said that the Department was looking for applications of scale and sustainability that could really make an impact.  This is possibly one such project because it will provide multifaceted benefits to an entire region of rural Waterford.  The other project involves the Mount Congreve estate which recently came into the ownership of the State.  Waterford Council has taken over the running of the estate which is a very unique rural tourism enterprise on the Waterford greenway, with which the Minister is very familiar.  The Minister has travelled along the greenway himself.  The project aims to build on the success of the greenway and extend it out into the new gardens that are being run by the council.  These gardens are a unique offering in terms of tourism and attracting international tourist footfall.  These two projects are currently being assessed by the Department and I am just trying to gauge whether the Department is interested in funding projects of that scale.  Is it the intention to fund multi-million euro projects that can have a real impact?  Under the town and village renewal scheme, for example, while there have been some success stories, most of the projects were very <i>ad hoc<\/i>and standalone.  The applications to which I refer are very collaborative and are co-ordinated across a whole region.  I am hoping that is what the Department is looking for because that is what has been submitted.  If these projects are successful, they will have a really beneficial impact on a whole swathe of communities across rural west county Waterford.<\/p><p>I also have a question on applicants who may be looking on but who are not as prepared as those that have already been submitted applications.  Will this funding continue for the next few years?  I ask this because communities are learning all of the time.  My own community of Portlaw was successful in its application for &euro;100,000 under the town and village renewal scheme.  That lifted the confidence of people in the community and showed them that when an effort is made on small projects, great things can be achieved by working with the local authority, members of the community and other stakeholders.  The same community is now considering submitting a larger scale application under the rural regeneration scheme, although not just yet.  Portlaw is my own home town.  It is unusual in being one of the only planned towns in Ireland.  It was built by a Quaker family, the Malcolmsons.  It was originally a mill town with serviced areas for the workers.  It has a very unique social history.  Unfortunately the old industrial site, of approximately ten acres, is a brownfield site right in the middle of the town.<\/p><p>As it is adjacent to the town centre, it is fully serviced.  It has all of the main services available to it, but because it is a brownfield site, there was never any interest in redeveloping or turning it into the amenity or attraction it should be.  It has tremendous potential.  I am trying to encourage Waterford City and County Council to identify the positives attached to sites such as this, derelict sites within town centre areas that are an eyesore but which have huge potential to improve the social fabric of a community and turn that community's confidence around.  Applications should be made under the rural regeneration scheme in respect of such sites.  What are the Minister's views in that regard?  This is a brownfield site which has been contaminated.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, &euro;200,000 was made available to make an assessment of the level of contamination.  A roadmap could be provided to redevelop and regenerate the site.  That is what the rural regeneration scheme should be about: regenerating derelict brownfield sites in the centre of towns throughout the country.  I mention the site to provide an example.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on whether an application could be made in respect of this site in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#H00300","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his contributions thus far.  I have a number of points to make and a number of questions to ask.  <\/p> <p>  As the Minister will be aware, we were delighted to welcome him to Castlerea recently.  I mention this in the light of the impact of programmes in category B and the achievement of value for money.  The Department provided almost &euro;1 million for the Beara-Breifne Way, a walking and cycling route from County Cork to County Cavan.  It is important that we work across Departments and agencies.  The provision of that funding is really important and we hope it will be a game changer in the development of the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands brand by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  On the day of the Minister's visit, I am sure the sense of commitment among community groups and volunteers and their pride in their area will have been more than obvious to him.<\/p> <p>  Another example we saw on that day was the provision of funding of &euro;1.5 million for the food hub in Castlerea under the rural regeneration programme which has been really important in filling a gap in the market in terms of the lack of chefs.  An Chistin which was initially provided with rural economic development zone, REDZ, funding has much larger ambitions to develop into a space to support people who want to set up businesses.  It hopes to achieve these ambitions through the voluntary group, Roscommon County Council, the Roscommon LEADER partnership, and Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.  We know that overheads are high and will prove difficult for people in the sector to meet, but on the particular day that ambition was very obvious.  LEADER programme funding has also been provided through Athleague Community Centre.<\/p> <p>  I want to mention the importance of another funding stream through the Department - CL&Aacute;R funding.  While we talk about significant funding that is really important with which to deliver bigger projects, the impact of CL&Aacute;R funding in enhancing safety should be mentioned.  We saw this on the particular day at Carrick national school, which is on the main road between Ballyhaunis and Castlerea which is an absolute death trap.  The Department provided &euro;50,000 to provide a new car park to take children away from the hard shoulder and provide a safe place in which to park for drop-off and collection.  The CL&Aacute;R funding is extremely important and just one example.  More than &euro;240,000 was provided for projects in the county this year.  It is, therefore, exceptionally important and I hope it will continue.<\/p> <p>  With reference to rural regeneration funding, the point the Minister made, that we should support the communities that need it most, is important.  Many of the challenges facing County Roscommon also arise in the north of the county.  Having seen Boyle, Castlerea, Ballaghaderreen and Tulsk all been supported with rural regeneration funding, I am satisfied that the funding is being used to support the communities that need it most.  <\/p> <p>  I have two questions, one of which is about the walks scheme on which I receive a lot of calls seeking an update.  It is really positive that the budget has been doubled, from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million.  An inspection with a view to including the Lung Valley within the Beara-Breifne way recently took place and went very well, but there is great anticipation and eagerness to have the area fall within the walks scheme.  Obviously, the inclusion of walks has to be approved by the National Trails Office.  I know that a process is under way, but will the Minister update us on when we are likely to hear the results in that regard?<\/p> <p>  My other question relates to the Western Development Commission, with which I know the Minister has been working closely.  I met its CEO, Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;in, recently and understand more staff are being recruited.  The commission is doing a significant amount of work, particularly on the Atlantic economic corridor and in encouraging working from home.  It was involved in a successful digital working hub scheme in Tulsk.  What is the Minister's view on how the commission can make further progress in developing and supporting communities in different areas?<\/p> <p>  I would like to comment on the TidyTowns competition.  In watching \"Nationwide\" on the evening the results were announced it was great to see so many people proud of their communities.  I absolutely agree with the Minister that some people could do with watching the programme, but it is dreadful to have to see volunteers having to pick up litter, as I do regularly, in bogs and along the sides of roads.  TidyTowns does so much good work in instilling a sense of pride in place.  It has also diversified so much in the context of further developments that have been supported with TidyTowns competition funding but also with funding under the town and village renewal scheme.  In my home town of Ballaghaderreen funding under the town and village renewal scheme was used to paint many derelict buildings.  The area has been given a great facelift and provided with a huge boost.  TidyTowns competition funding is provided, but the town and village renewal scheme is also important in enhancing streetscapes, making us proud of the areas in which we live and encouraging tourists to visit them.<\/p> <p>  My questions were about the walks scheme and the Western Development Commission.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for all of his work.  As we heard in his opening statement, a great deal of work has been done to make the Department highly functional.  That has not happened by accident.  I am very aware of the impact of the many schemes which have been opened and reopened.  The positive role they play in supporting volunteers, local authorities and local community groups is extremely evident.  It was more than obvious during the Minister's recent visit to Castlerea.  I thank the Minister again for his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#J00200","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Coffey for his comments on the rural regeneration scheme.  He asked a few questions and spoke about individual cases.  Naturally enough, I will not comment on individual cases.  To be fair, many applicants under the first round of the rural regeneration scheme did not really know what was expected of them.  I will outline the process, the funding, where we are going and what we have.  The first round of the scheme was new for me and for the Department.  It was new for everybody.  We all learned a great deal from it.  Many applications were received.  Forty-six applications came from one county.  I do not care how good they are.  They could not get 46 applications for a rural regeneration scheme.  Independent Deputies complained because they did not get funding.  I would love members to go in to see the quality of the applications.  It was just before the local elections.  It was a case of one for everyone in the audience.  That is not what the rural regeneration scheme is about.  It is about the issues that the Chairman and Senator Coffey have spoken about.  The Senator is right when he says that the Waterford greenway is a fantastic operation in his local countryside.  It has lifted Thomastown and other towns and villages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#K00200","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":890,"content":"<p>Kilmacthomas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#K00300","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":891,"content":"<p>Kilmacthomas.

I think the number of allocations made during the first round represented a great achievement on the part of the Department.  They are now progressing.  The Senator asked about giving guidance to applicants.  We have done that.  To be fair to my officials and staff, they went around the country.  They had meetings.  They brought in the local authorities and the LEADER companies.  They brought in anybody who had made an application.  They went through what they are expecting from the next round.  They went through where applicants went wrong in the particular round they were in.  I have to say my staff put a lot of work into getting people to participate.  They did too good of a job.  We now have applications worth a record &euro;169 million.  We do not have that kind of funding to allocate.  A really competitive process is under way now.  The evaluation committee, which evaluates and looks at the applications, will put forward the projects to me.  There is going to be real competition this time.  There has been a big improvement in the standard of applications this time.  To be fair, it was a new programme the last time.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether we are continuing with the funding.  Yes, we are.  People said it would not happen.  People said it was only a scam, in the context of the 2040 project, but that is not true.  One round is already over.  Eighty-four projects were approved in the first round.  Thirty-eight categories were approved in category 2.  To respond to another question he asked, some &euro;1 billion is being provided over ten years.  People can come in under category 2 to draw down funding to make their projects category 1 projects.  That was another omission in the past, when groups did not have the money to put an application together.  Now we are providing the funding for that.  We will be opening that again shortly.  We opened the first round and we allocated the funding.  We opened the second round in August and we will announce the successful applications in the next few weeks.  We will open it again early in the new year.  The programme will continue for ten years.  The money is there.  It has been committed by the Government.  There will be a real demand for that funding over the next few years because the quality of applications will get better, particularly now that category 2 is in place.  We did not have that in the first round because it was a new scheme.  A number of groups got money the last time to make their applications fall under category 1.  They are working.  They are coming in with fantastic applications.  There are fantastic applications around the country.  We have heard about digital hubs and food hubs.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to Senator Hopkins in a moment.  Fantastic projects are already taking place around the country.  Regardless of who is here in ten years' time, he or she will be able to identify what was done in every county under the rural regeneration scheme.  Senator Coffey spoke about rural development.  There is no doubt that the schemes which have been introduced by the Department have given a new lease of life to many communities.  We would like to have more money and more funding.  As a Department, we have done very well.  We have been in operation for two years.  I think we have achieved a great deal in the last two years.  I thank the Senator for his comments.

I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, is here too.  I welcome the improvement in the standard of applications.  That has to be noted by this committee because it is something we look at regularly when we hear from community groups.  I want us to note that.  I would like to ask the Minister about the scale of projects.  He does not need to be too specific.  If he could give us an idea of the minimum or maximum value of projects, that would help us to understand the level of ambition involved in this scheme.  Are we talking about &euro;1 million projects or &euro;2 million projects?  Does the Department have an open mind?  Does it depend on the evaluation that is done by the panel which examines these matters?  I am trying to get an idea of the scale of these projects to give communities an understanding of whether they are being too ambitious or reaching too high.  We want game changers for rural Ireland.  I am trying to get an idea of the scale of the projects being submitted.  We must remember they are being submitted by stakeholders that are collaborating.  I have mentioned an example in County Waterford.  Communities are coming together with LEADER and the council.  The entire west of the county - not just individual villages - is coming together to try to lift the region.  I wonder whether this is an example of the type of ambition the Minister is looking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#K01100","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":899,"content":"<p>The Senator is quite correct in what he says about ambition.  That is why we have asked for collaboration.  We have allowed local authorities, LEADER companies, State agencies and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to collaborate with groups.  The Senator has asked a question.  We want to get projects that involve collaboration.  We do not want to fund projects that do not have a chance.  That is why the evaluation committee is there.  We have to fund projects that have a chance.  In every walk of life, there will be things that work very well.  Regardless of what business one is in, one will come across good ideas that may not work.  We do not mind taking some risks.  The evaluation committee has to make a decision.  It has to look at what will happen if funding is provided for a project.  Will it be sustainable in the future?  Will employment be created from it in the future?  Will it need further funding from somebody else at a later stage?  All of this is considered.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coffey spoke about a development in his own county.  I have not looked at it yet.  All I am saying is that it will be very carefully looked at.  The committee will look at the criteria, at whether it is sustainable, at what it will do for communities and at what it will do for jobs.  I have to mention the work done by the evaluation committee on the last occasion.  The Senator is quite correct.  I want to make it clear that the standard of applications this time has been a big improvement on the last time.  To be fair, people know now what is expected of them.  My officials went out to talk to people and to go through these matters with them.  I have to say it is fantastic that we have so many applications.  Applications worth &euro;169 million have been received in a very short period since we allocated the funding in February.  We have funded projects from &euro;500,000 upwards.  We look at each application.  We have funded projects up to &euro;10 million.  We have funded projects of &euro;3 million, &euro;2 million, &euro;330,000, &euro;969,000 and &euro;845,000.  We look at each case.  The big thing is the collaboration with State agencies, local authorities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and LEADER companies.  When they submit their applications, they have a great deal of groundwork done to make sure they are sustainable.  That is the whole issue.  They have to be sustainable.  I will explain what we do not want.  The Senator will recall that several years ago, the big fad was the development of community centres.<\/p><p>Some were fantastic but then everybody in the audience had to have one.  As a result, we had three in places that were within a two or three-mile radius.  Now, it is only the ones that were really needed that are surviving while the others are not.  <\/p><p> Senator Hopkins asked about the walks scheme first.  We have opened the walks scheme again.  I got an extra &euro;2 million this year.  We have received 59 expressions of interest and there are 979 landowners.  I hope to announce the first phase of successful applicants shortly.  The scheme is fantastic and is run well by my Department.  Again, funding is key.  I will not close the walks scheme.  I will shortly announce the names of the successful applicants.  There was a lot of work involved with assessing whether applications were value for money and, therefore, would receive funding.  The good news is that the scheme is open, we had &euro;2 million but we got &euro;2 million so we will have &euro;4 million.  The scheme will be left open to receive expressions of interest and we will assess it on a year-to-year basis.<\/p><p> The Senator talked about the rural regeneration scheme and I agree with her.  I visited Castlerea and Athleague in County Roscommon where I saw that people appreciated the funding that the Department gave to different projects.  I visited the food hub in Castlerea, where I witnessed the enthusiasm of the people involved, as well as by their commitment and development ambitions.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the shortage of chefs and how people in the region are getting employment.  Recently I visited the Mayo Abbey Training Centre to present certificates to 14 or 15 chefs who participated in a 12 or 13-week programme.  The common denominator between the chefs is that every single one of them got a job on completion of the course and that might be lesson for the education sector and everybody else.  One needs to train people to meet demand.  In this country there is at present a demand for chefs, good quality food and digital hubs.  In my own town and county, we set up a digital hub that has a queue of people seeking to avail of.  I know of one person who runs her business from the hub and recently she won a contract from a major multinational to pay out its wages.  She is doing that work from a town in rural Ireland.  Broadband will be a game changer.  We need high-speed broadband to be rolled out to every rural community in order that people can work from home.  Many multinational companies have said they will be able to create more jobs and people can work from their homes when we have high-speed broadband, which needs to be rolled out.<\/p><p> As for the CL&Aacute;R programme, I have been blamed for its success.  I was allocated &euro;5 million in the budget and for the last few years due to making savings I allocated a further amount of money.  Recently I had to put in place categories.  The largest category is the support for schools but there is also community safety, play areas and community welfare.  I also set up a number of other schemes, such as support for first responders in terms of ambulances and established sensory gardens.  I want to fund sections of society that will not secure funding from elsewhere.  I want to give them an opportunity where there is demand and a need.  Last year, due to extra funding, I funded more projects.  This year I did not have the same amount of funding because, despite what was said by some Deputies in certain political parties, 100% of the budget for my capital programme was spent last year.  While 99% of the funding for our current programme has been spent, we made savings on services that we were using with another Department.  Originally we thought we would have to pay funding for services but then we did not have to, so we saved &euro;1.4 million and we saved money due to a reduced need for staff.  Every single penny of the capital programme was spent and 99% of the current programme has been spent so it is a great success. <\/p><p> I have spoken about the tidy towns competition and Senator Hopkins is quite correct.  I have witnessed what the competition does for communities and for this country.  We do not thank or give the deserved recognition to the organisers and volunteers for the fantastic work that they do.<\/p><p> The Senator spoke about the Western Development Commission.  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, he was not here.  He is present now so he might add to what I say.  The commission has a new CEO who is a very good person.  He is doing very well and is going in new directions.  We have a new board and more staff have been employed.  A new five-year strategy development plan for 2019 to 2024 has been put in place called \"Work Smarter, Live Better\".  Perhaps my Minister of State will comment and I thank him for coming.  As I said earlier, he was delayed because he had to respond to questions in the D&aacute;il.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#K01200","speaker":"1500","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being present.

The time of this meeting clashed with other meetings and, unfortunately, I could not be here to listen to the Minister's presentation.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development is of great interest to me as I represent the very rural constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which also includes part of County Meath.  I compliment the Minister on the work done by his Department.  The funding provided is hugely important for rural constituencies in the form of CL&Aacute;R, LIS, LEADER, digital hubs and the town and village renewal scheme.  All of the schemes are very worthy and have borne fruit in towns and villages in my constituency.  <\/p> <p>  I have spoken at length with the Minister about CL&Aacute;R funding.  One can see from the applications submitted to the Department that the vast amount of them were from schools.  Presumably, the schools cannot get funding for traffic calming measures, playgrounds and exercise facilities in any other way.  People in County Cavan are delighted to see that Drumkilly national school, Milltown national school, the alleyways in the Drumbannon estate, Bailieborough, Billis national school, Darley national school and Mullahoran national school were successful under measure 1 and measure 2 applications by Cavan County Council.  If one reads the project descriptions in the application form,s one will discover that the reasons are exactly what I mentioned in respect of schools finding it difficult to get funding for traffic calming measures, carparks, footpaths, soft play areas and all-weather pitches.  Therefore, CL&Aacute;R funding is hugely important to small communities and schools that have no other way to access funding.  <\/p> <p>  As the Minister said himself, the Department is a victim of its own success in the sense that there has been a deluge of applications.  Today, I wish to refer to Scoil Bhr&iacute;de, Killeshandra, St. Mary's boys national school, Belturbet, Shannon Gaels GAA club, Bruskey national school, Ballynarry national school, Trivia House, Swanlinbar, St. Felim's national school, Ballinagh, St. Felim's national school or the Vale school, Bailieborough, and Kingscourt community centre.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot fund them all but these are very worthy cases and the funding will be spent on groundworks, drainage, fencing, extensions to existing playgrounds, multipurpose game areas and the resurfacing of all-weather pitches.<\/p><p>They are the disappointed applicants.  In the Minister's perusal of the applications,do they need to be strengthened in any way or has it simply become so competitive that he cannot do it all?  How can we, on an all-party basis, help to ensure there will be funds in place in order that all such worthy applications will be successful?  The Minister might comment on whether it would be worth their while reapplying to him.<\/p><p> It is wonderful to see the local improvement scheme, LIS, up and running again.  As the Minister will be aware, the scheme was closed for the receipt of applications for a period of ten years during which time many local authorities did right by people by continuing to accept their applications.  For example, a man in his autumn years, Mr. Seamus Clarke, in Killinkere, County Cavan applied for the scheme almost ten years ago around the time I started in politics in 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#L00900","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy not to mention persons by name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#M00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I beg your pardon.  Such persons throughout the country are deeply frustrated.  Cavan County Council can only deliver on a small number of schemes.  On an annual basis we are in single digits through no fault of the local authority.  I appreciate that it receives a certain amount, but we are trying to fill a ten-year gap when the scheme  was not open for the receipt of applications.  However, many local authorities were good enough to continue to accept application forms in the belief and understanding that some day the scheme would be reopened for the receipt of applictions.  It is of huge importance to communities, in particular, for farmers across counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath, that funding for the scheme be increased.  Does the Minister see himself being in a position to deliver more schemes because it is our job as the local Deputies to ensure the Government provides as much funding as possible and I suppose adopts a positive bias towards counties and constituencies, the economies of which are dependent on the agriculture sector to keep young people working on farms?  That is what the LIS does.  It is the scheme that is of most importance to my constituency.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned broadband provision.  It is something about which he is passionate.  There is a successful digital hub in Cavan town.  The reason it is so successful is that a broadband connection is not available.  The further one goes from Cavan town in my neck of the woods towards Canningstown, Knockbride and Killinkere and on into west Cavan to places such as Bawnboy and Swanlinbar broadband is not available.  The digital hubs have been filling that gap by allowing people a space in which to work, network with others who are running small businesses and seek business further afield outside their own county by having access to the worldwide web.  Will the Minister comment on the digital hubs and broadband provision, indicating where he sees us going because constituencies such as mine are paralysed without a broadband service.  I meet young people in my constituency offices for whom the availability of broadband will determines whether they will live in a rural part of the county or considering exiting.  We have as a result seen an exodus of young people from counties such as Cavan, Monaghan and Meath.  Broadband provision is a huge issue for them.  If they cannot do their work and their children cannot access the Internet to carry out research in doing their homework and studying for college, they cannot consider living in a rural part of County Cavan or County Monaghan.  Will the Minister also comment on this issue?<\/p> <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund is doing tremendous work.  In Castleblaney we will have someone - the Acting Chairman has someone from his area coming too - to talk about the success of the feasibility studies in the context of the regeneration of the main streets.

The guy who has been waiting for ten years would probably need to submit a new application.  Last year the Minister allocated two tranches of funds, one early and one later in the year.  Is there a possibility that the same will happen this year?  The LIS has solved many problems where people live on roads not within the remit of the local authority, which is good.<\/p> <p>  Under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the town and village renewal scheme, great success has been achieved in places throughout the country.  Every one of us has probably been involved with Tidy Towns.  Last year the Minister announced that some Tidy Towns committees would receive &euro;1,000 and others, &euro;2,000.  Will such funding be provided again this year?  Perhaps the money was to be used for a celebration after so many years work.<\/p> <p>  The following is directed at the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.  In the programme for Government reference is made to the Atlantic economic corridor.  The Minister of State has spokem about it and I am aware that he is involved in its development.  Has an application for TEN-T funding yet been made by the Department?  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was making it, but the Minister of State was liaising with it on the inclusion of the Atlantic economic corridor.<\/p> <p>  On the LEADER programme, there were problems early on.

In County Galway, for example, there was funding made available for 12 safety measures last year.  There was funding for six such measures this year.  Is there any hope extra funding can be made available given this year?  What the CL&Aacute;R programme does is great in providing for safety measures - the case of the school in Carrick in Ballinlough was mentioned - to ensure the safety of both motorists and children.  In that regard, I wonder if there will be a second round of funding towards the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#M00900","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":917,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for her comments on the Department and acknowledging that the funding provided is helpful to rurar communities.<\/p> <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was the big issue raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  As I stated, we received 490 applications last year but were only able to fund 179.  I suppose the programme is a victim of its own success.  Last year there was a second round of funding because of savings made in the Department.  I am looking to see whether there will be savings made this year.  As I stated, I have looked at different measures under the programme such as the provision of first responders and playgrounds.  I have tried to strike a balance to provide a certain amount for each project.  This year there was a big demand from schools.<\/p> <p>  What I am finding with a lot of Departments is that everything is being thrown on my Department.  I would like to see greater collaboration with other Departments.  For example, I would like to see the Department of Education and Skills providing some funding to support projects.  I am actually funding the undertaking of works outside schools.  I do not regret this one little bit because in some areas there have been very serious accidents in which children have been badly injured.  There have also been pile-ups when parents have been dropping their children to school.  We have done a lot of work inside and outside schools which includes the provision of parking spaces.  We have undertaken some fantastic projects for schools under the safety scheme.  It is a scheme under which next year I will be looking at changing the profile of funding.  I might be able to provide more funding for schools.  I would welcome the Department of Education and Skills providing a little more in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Niamh Smyth talked about the local improvement scheme, LIS.  If Deputy Fitzmaurice does not mind, I will answer both Deputies at the same time.  Under the LIS, I provided funding early this year.  I provided it in February.  Senator Conway-Walsh also raised this question.<\/p><p>I gave them &euro;10 million.  The spend has been &euro;5.6 million to date.  How can I give them any more money when they will not spend the money they have?  It makes my job very difficult.  The Deputies are both correct that there is such a demand for the LIS.  I also referred to this when replying to the Senator earlier.  The local authorities are charging the Department 13% in some cases for carrying out work but it varies around the country.  Instead of them charging me and my Department for doing LIS roads, the time has come to have a partnership.  I could do something different with the LIS.  I would like the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the local authorities to put a bit of money into the scheme.  We have a major national problem with the LIS because more and more roads needing to be done.  I would like to have more roads done.<\/p><p> Since I came into office I have put &euro;48 million in during a short period.  It is a substantial amount for this small Department and I would like a bit of support now from the local authorities.  I could do what a previous Government and a previous Minister did - and there was nothing wrong with what he did - which was to make the local authority top it up in CL&Aacute;R areas.  If I do that, however, I would not be able to give funding to areas that do not have CL&Aacute;R.  My Department needs to have discussions with the local authorities.  They also have ways and means of getting revenue in.  It is one thing for me to give funding such as &euro;10 million but then 13% of that across the board is being paid out for local authority staffing when the staff is there.  It does not make sense when we have a need for the LIS.  I am just putting that marker down.  I want local authorities to match the funding I give.  If they are doing 30 roads in a county, they could then do 60.  I am making that call so that my officials and the CCMA will sit down and see if they can come up with a scheme where the local authorities would put some money in along with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I have asked the Chairman previously about the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in this regard.  That is the Department with responsibility for roads.  If I did not bring this scheme in, there would be no scheme.  I brought the scheme in.  I had to go to the Government looking for funding.  There was no LIS for a good many years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#M01000","speaker":"1500","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":919,"content":"<p>We certainly support the Minister on that.

Before the Minister established his Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that gave funding for local improvement schemes, which was proper order.  Since the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is not contributing to it now, I hear the point the Minister is making that local authorities should contribute, but Cavan County Council, for example, is down 50% on its annual revenue funding for roads.  It is my understanding that local authorities have nothing to give in that regard.  I take the Minister's point about the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because it is about roads.  He is correct that this is an area to which the Department should contribute.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will be aware from the list of applications I have outlined that the vast majority of applicants are schools.  They cannot get funds anywhere else.  I believe that the Department of Education and Skills should also intervene and support what the Minister is doing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to LEADER, and Breffni Integrated funding, there was some criticism in respect of getting funds out.  I attended Aughaloora Bruskey community centre recently.  They had a greenfield site and now, in the heart of the country, they have a fabulous brand new community centre with hundreds of people attending, be it for bingo on a Sunday night or for community events.  They held their opening recently.  This is down to Breffni Integrated and LEADER funding from the Minister's Department.  What people are achieving by pulling communities together in the middle of nowhere is phenomenal.<\/p> <p>  The Shercock community first responders received money and CL&Aacute;R funding from the Minister's Department and I supported them and the Minister in that.  They are saving lives.  I believe they received some &euro;14,000 or &euro;15,000, which has made such a difference.  They now have 14 volunteers on call 24-7 to respond to people who are in almost fatal situations.  The group is saving lives and the funding has made a huge difference.

Councillors also have a responsibility.  It is fine for them to throw over the blame to this Department and say they want more money, but they have a budget process.  I have not seen any council yet put funding into LIS in its budget process.  I call on all of the councils in the State to put a bit of funding into the LIS.  I have put my share of it in.

I know the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, will add to this.  My view is that it is the most important piece of infrastructure.  It is not that many years ago - some members are too young to remember - when the by-election was held in 1975.  At that time, the lack of lighting in certain places was a big issue in north Mayo.  At that time, officials in Dublin were talking about whether or not they would give lighting to rural Ireland - whether it would be economic to do so.  Broadband is the same.  It is a critical piece of infrastructure that we are going to need and want and that we should have regardless of whether it involves a child in Belmullet, Blacksod or Blackrock.  Children in all these locations deserve equality and should have the same facility.  A child in any of these areas that do not have broadband who is doing his or her leaving certificate should have the same facility that is available in other areas so that he or she does not have to go into towns to obtain information from the Internet.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#N01500","speaker":"1500","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":934,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about TEN-T.  The Atlantic economic corridor task force met with officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I sat down and discussed TEN-T and the Atlantic area.  Following on from that, we had a presentation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at a task force meeting.  Following on from that, a letter was crafted in consultation with our Department and sent to the Commissioner asking him to take on a review of the TEN-T process.  The letter cited the reasons for it, including the fact that the Atlantic economic corridor region needs to be included in TEN-T.  There will be an early review of the TEN-T process.  It has been brought forward by two years so it is with the Commission.  The process has begun.  I want to put on record that the letter from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was fully supportive of the reconfiguration of the maps to make sure the west of Ireland and all the infrastructural projects would be included in that.  I compliment the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his officials on their co-operation in getting that done.  It was a long time coming.  It took time to get there but there is a better understanding because of the collaboration on that issue between the Atlantic economic corridor task force and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p> <p>  I concur wholeheartedly with the argument that broadband is essential.  In 2019, rural broadband and regional economic development received an allocation of &euro;2.4 million.  This provided funding of &euro;42,000 to each local authority to support broadband officers, which is a total figure of &euro;1.3 million.  The role of broadband officers is to facilitate the telecommunications industry to roll out infrastructure to make sure we remove barriers and black spots for mobile phone and broadband coverage.  Some very exciting things have been done in Mayo where the broadband officer has created an app that has mapped all the existing duct work or pipes in the ground so that if any telecommunications company wants to provide a service to any town or village, it knows what is in the ground and where to find it.  That app will be rolled out to every local authority where the broadband officers will take that on board.  TII has retrofitted about &euro;12 million worth of duct work into the motorways to make sure we are prepared for anything that might happen in the future.  We are doing great work there.  The broadband officers are also a very good information point for issues such as broadband being beside a house and it not being possible to get access to it.  The broadband officers will find out what is available through the telecommunications companies and if it is not available, how long someone must wait for the intervention.  A person will get a factual answer rather than a fuzzy one and will be told about the companies that have availability within that area.  I reiterate what the Minister said about broadband and the 1.1 million people in this country - 25% of our population - who do not have access to high-speed broadband.  The national broadband plan is essential.  It is not a discussion; it is something we will be doing.  The final due diligence is being done.  The maps closed on 30 September for any private company that wanted to say that it could provide additional broadband.  That map has been sweated and the results of that will be sent to the European Commission, which must approve the final sign off of the contract.  We are working towards getting that done as quickly as possible.  Given the level of investment, it is important that we do it right and make sure we have all our i's dotted and t's crossed to make sure we protect public money and customers so that they will have high-speed broadband for the next 35 years without any slowdown or diminution of the service in ten, 15 or 20 years time.  That is the important part.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019101600002#O00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I have allocated &euro;1.4 million to Tidy Towns this year.

There is no point in me going to Government, fighting for a budget when we have a massive demand for LIS, and the councils get money they are not spending.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems is that I cannot change the rules and regulations because the LIS is a statutory scheme.  There are sometimes different reasons they do not complete the spending of the funding.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to council staff and she may be right about the outdoor staff.  I looked at figures in the past week regarding the number of staff that every local authority employs throughout the country.  We need more staff and we need more people on the ground.  The local authorities have been told that for the past number of years but it seems they feel they need more engineers than outdoor staff.  I do not agree.  If one thing came up at the local elections, it was in regard to not having enough outdoor staff.  It is about not having the services when people are paying their property tax and businesses are paying their rates.  The councils have a legal obligation in regard to some services.  While they do not deal with water or refuse anymore, they have to provide other services.  The one issue that came up on housing estates was that more outdoor staff were needed.<\/p> <p>  For example, there are areas to be cleaned.  Where I live, there are ten houses and every year we put &euro;1,500 or &euro;1,600 aside to do our own grass cutting and so on, and we pay for that ourselves, despite the fact we pay our property tax and other taxes.

In Ireland, dance has often been considered theatre's lesser sibling.  However, in recent years, Irish contemporary dance has exploded out of this shadow to stake its place strongly on the national and global stage, as artists with rich, diverse voices appear at the world's major festivals and venues and their works feature in lists such as<i>The Guardian&rsquo;s<\/i>best dance of the 21st century.<br\/><br\/>Arts and culture are cornerstones for a healthy society and dance is an elemental part of that fabric.  I would like to start this presentation with words from our younger audience members as they left the theatre, having seen David Bolger's &quot;The Wolf and Peter&quot;, to emphasise the fact that culture transforms, culture is not neutral and the language of dance is universal.<\/p> <blockquote> \t<i>From an audio-visual presentation:<\/i><br \/><br \/>I really like The Wolf and Peter;  I liked how they showed it all by dancing and not by talking;  My favourite part was when the wolf was dancing;  We thought it was really funny;  I liked when they were doing gymnastics;  The music was really good;  It was interesting when the wolf was dancing;  The piano could do anything without stopping;  It was really good;  My favourite character was the cat;  My favourite character is Peter the cat; I like all the animals;  They are all really funny;  I think everybody should go and see this show;  Me too;  There are some funny parts and scary parts and some sad parts;  I would give it ten out of ten;  I would give it 100 out of ten. <\/blockquote> <p>CoisC&eacute;im is unique in an Irish context in the way that we coherently connect performance and participation activity to broaden, deepen and diversify the public&rsquo;s engagement with the performing arts through contemporary dance.  We aim to inspire, challenge, provoke and stimulate and actively seek to collaborate at every stage.  Our work is benchmarked with the best in world and David Bolger&rsquo;s distinctive style on stage, on film and off site has accessed millions of people, introducing many to the art form for the first time.  Projects such as &quot;The Wolf and Peter&quot; with Creative Dance Tales, These Rooms and 38 Women, clearly show how an integrated approach can help to embed creative capacity into communities for the long term.  With the support of the Arts Council of Ireland and Culture Ireland, CoisC&eacute;im has had an extraordinary five years as we have magnified this reputation as creators of relevant, meaningful work at the forefront of contemporary art practice.<\/p><p>For example, the show, &quot;&quot;The Wolf and Peter&quot;&quot;, thrilled almost 20,000 children and their families from Sligo to the Sydney Opera House.  Our major four-year co-production entitled, These Rooms, brought Irish artists back to the London International Festival of Theatre for the first time in 27 years and featured in the 14-18 NOW's culmination programme to mark the centenary of the First World War.  The performance entitled, &quot;Body Language&quot;, in collaboration with Royal Hibernian Academy Gallery, enabled more than 13,000 people to encounter contemporary dance in a different context, and their response to this work was remarkable.<br\/><br\/>The primary reason behind these successes was a synergy between funding and programming cycles.  Both &quot;The Wolf and Peter&quot; and &quot;These Rooms&quot; benefited from Arts Council advance planning funding strands.  This meant that we were able to initiate and lead collaborations and co-productions with presenters, festivals and other funders to allow the full artistic potential of the works to be realised at home and abroad, thus unlocking fascinating opportunities for the future for contemporary dance made in Ireland.  For example, &quot;These Rooms&quot; brought CoisC&eacute;im together with ANU Productions and the Dublin Theatre Festival, London International Festival of Theatre, LIFT, 14-18 NOW, Shoreditch Town Hall, Tate Gallery in Liverpool, National Museum of Ireland. National Archives of Ireland, Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and Culture Ireland, doubling the Arts Council investment.<br\/><br\/>Why is dance important?  It is said that more than 65% of our communication is non-verbal.  Numerous studies describe the benefits of seeing and participating in contemporary dance.  As David Bolger notes in an interview for our new production, &quot;Francis Footwork&quot;, which has its world premiere this evening in Galway:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhen we are infants we are quite proficient at communicating with our bodies.  We learn to understand movement as a language.  We learn rhythm from the heartbeat in the womb, and carry forward that sense of rhythm.  Dancing is a natural feeling, it makes you feel stronger, happier and is hugely important for our development as adults.  It improves communication skills and has only positive benefits in every aspect of our lives. <\/blockquote><p>Dance is not just an important and fundamental component of the performing arts; it is a core ingredient for happy and healthy citizens.<br\/><br\/>It is concerning that Dance Ireland is not represented here today, given the focus of the meeting on dance as a performance art.  It is a bit like having a discussion about wages for artists without the presence the Equity union.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, dance has been disproportionately affected by funding cuts in recent years, materially impacting on the ability of artists to create work.  As an inherently non-commercial art form, State support is vital for the sector to thrive.  We call strongly on the Government to deliver on its 2017 pledge to double arts funding by 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bridget Webster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Webster for her presentation.

I worked in a number of roles before joining the council.  I shall start by defining dance.  The meaning of dance extends beyond the genres that we support through the council.  Usually, when we talk about dance in our policy, we refer to activities that are led by professional artists or companies, although these activities have a high level of involvement by audiences, such as in dance shows or participatory activities such as dance classes, local festivals or community projects.  These are the activities that we usually refer to in policy papers.  We talk about artistic productions, tourism, dance centres and services, youth practice and community projects.  We also talk about dance genres such as classical ballet, modern dance, contemporary dance, dance theatre, traditional Irish dance, hip-hop, etc.  There are many possible narratives.  All of these terms represent a vast field of practice.  However, when talking about dance, it is essential to consider an even deeper meaning - it is that represented by dance as a primordial manifestation of human emotions and the human spirit, it is that of embodied emotions and social interactions, and it is the way in which human beings have celebrated throughout history and across world cultures.  In practical terms, I am referring to simple activities such as people dancing in a club or at a wedding.  I am also referring to spontaneous street dance, someone dancing in his or her bedroom or a couple dancing a waltz.  It is important to the many manifestations of dance.  Once we consider this broad definition of dance, we can more comprehensively discuss its importance as an art form.<br\/><br\/>Dance is a vast and important topic.  I propose a narrative based on two types of benefits.  One is the importance of dance to the individual and the other is the importance of dance for society.  In terms of the importance of dance to the individual, the narrative refers to forms of psychological or physiological benefits.  I  am not a medical expert but, as an former professional, dancer, I can testify to the value of body awareness.  Many medical conditions are the result of skeletal misalignments, poor physical posture and general disregard for the signs that our bodies constantly send us.  Besides the most obvious benefits associated with a physically active lifestyle, dance is a powerful tool for acquiring body awareness, and it is particularly true of contemporary dance and all dance genres.  Over the years, contemporary dance has been associated with certified disciplines such as body-mind centering, the Feldenkrais method, the Alexander technique, somatic studies, Pilates and the more ancient disciplines of yoga and tai chi.  The latter are not types of dances but they are some of the practices that have informed contemporary dance in recent times.  I can provide some anecdotal evidence of the psychological benefits in building confidence, expressing personal emotions and mediating interaction with others.  These elements are particularly important for youth practice but they are relevant for us all.  In my professional career, I have come across specific studies on these topic and I have direct experience and heard stories of how people's lives have been transformed by dance. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the importance of dance to society, dance is a shared identity that unites specific communities.  Each type of step is a symbol that carries meaning.  It is a way to express a particular shared identity and world view.  This can be said as much for the aesthetics of ballet as for the types of step dancing that are related to different communities in Ireland.  As mentioned by Ms Catherine Foley in her book, <i>Step Dancing in Ireland<\/i>, dance can express, shape and embody different notions of cultural identity: self, affinity groups, regional, national, global or imagined. <br\/><br\/>The importance of dance can also be discussed in the context of critical discourse and international exchange.  As dance is part of a worldwide heritage, its practice allows people to connect with people in other countries and be part of a global community - one that is founded on beauty and ideas rather than blind profit and division. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I will give an overview of how funding by the Arts Council is distributed as part of the dance budget and I am open to questions on same.  In 2019, &euro;3.3 million has been allocated to dance.  With this fund, we support 11 strategically funded organisations that are of core strategic and national importance.  Crucially, this year almost &euro;500,000 has been allocated through the arts grant funding scheme, which will support an additional three production companies, three independent dance artists and one resource organisation.  This is important to the investment in dance.<\/p><p>I wish to also stress the importance of independent dance practice pursued by artists working outside formal company structures.  We support this practice throughout the country and across various genres by means of several projects and awards such as regional dance residencies, bursary awards, travel and training awards and a partnership for young emerging dance artists, entitled Step Up.  It is important to note that we provide additional supports to dance through corporate programmes such as the touring and dissemination of work scheme and the festival events scheme.  Further supports are provided from other teams' budgets such as traditional arts, young people, children and education, arts venues, arts participation and festivals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Davide Terlingo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Yurick to make her presentation on behalf of the Dance Theatre of Ireland.

Mr. Connor and I have been professional dancers, choreographers, teachers and artistic directors for both Dublin Contemporary Dance Theatre and the Dance Theatre of Ireland in the past 30 years.  We are grateful to have been able to make more than 40 works and to create, perform and teach throughout Ireland, Europe, the USA and Korea.  We are co-founders and former officers of Dance Ireland and will discuss some issues in that regard.  It was set up to represent the needs of professional dancers and choreographers.  We are founders of the Dublin Youth Dance Company, as well as the Dance Theatre of Ireland centre for dance in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is one of the first purpose-built centres for dance and which was opened by former President, Mary McAleese.  More than 2,000 members of the public dance recreationally there, with participants from the age of three to 93.  We run one of Ireland's largest educational outreach programmes in dance, which has introduced more than 80,000 adults and young people to modern dance.  Most recently, in the past five years, we were co-founders of the Well-Dance for Seniors programme and are current finalists for the 2019 national lottery good causes award.<\/p> <p>  We wish to address the needs of professional dance and what can be done better in that regard, as well as the importance of dance for health and well-being.  Dance has a major contribution to make to culture, community and people.  We are passionate about dance, but it is not a profession for the weak of heart.  Training takes many years and is costly, the hours are very long and the work is demanding and highly competitive.  Rates of pay are poor and contracts are short term.  There is little security.  That said, dance is one of the most powerful and vibrant art forms.  It can move us in a way nothing else can and helps us remember things we need to remember.  Dance matters because, through dance, we understand how we matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Loretta Yurick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>There is funding for independent projects, resource organisations and dance production companies to create on a project basis, but they are all under-funded.  What is missing in this landscape is sufficient money for dance companies to offer dancers sustained work on an ongoing basis.  Why does this matter?  The biggest problem facing dance is sustainability.  The lack of sustainability means dance artists are not able to work consistently.  Funding on a project-to-project basis provides valuable seed money, but sufficient funding for a number of production companies to employ dancers on longer contracts is needed.  That would constitute investment in the growth and development of artists and dance.<\/p> <p>  To be a choreographer and make work, one must also be a producer, recruiter, administrator, grant writer, fund raiser and gig-booker.  One must find and hire dancers and navigate the tax system or find an administrator willing to work short-term for little money.  One must find a composer, a lighting designer and a costume and graphic designer and organise everything else to get the work onstage.  Choreographers do all that at night and are in the studio during the day.  Dancers and choreographers, whether small or large, need more money to employ dancers and to invest in full-time administrative resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>The other issue we wish to raise with the committee is that dance, and contemporary dance in particular, is poised to make a significant contribution to social, physical and mental well-being for all.  What would the members say if they were offered a prescription that would make them feel less pain, improve their balance, make it easier to meet people, feel less stiff, more fluid, think clearer, breathe deeper, sleep better, reach higher, smile more and be more confident, and without any side effects?  That is what contemporary dance can do.  We have a developed an evidence-based programme that can be delivered by professional dance artists and that makes people feel good in themselves and is good for them. It is called Well-Dance for Seniors.  It is a modern dance and music programme designed and developed specifically for older adults and those with Parkinson's disease or dementia.  It addresses balance, fitness, mobility, cognitive functioning, memory and recall and, more important, it takes people into their own well of creativity.<\/p> <p>  Why dance and why now?  Ireland&rsquo;s population is shifting to one with a much higher proportion of older people, with the proportion to double by 2031.  There is a tsunami of age-related illness coming, including dementia, falls, cardiovascular disease and arthritis.  Recent studies indicate 28% of all seniors are either clinically depressed or borderline, and of those, almost 50% have a low rate of engagement; their world has shrunk.

Dance is recognised in international research, including in a two-year study by Dr. Deirdre Connolly, head of occupational therapy at Trinity College Dublin, as the most effective activity for offsetting and delaying many age-related illnesses.  People who dance frequently are 76% less likely to develop dementia.  It also reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and depression and benefits reaction times and cognitive performance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571180400,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>We need more funding for dance and health and more sustained two and three-year funding, including full-time administration, for more dance production companies.

As Isadora Duncan once said, \"If I could tell you what it meant, there would be no point in dancing it.\"  I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the importance of dance as a performance art and related matters.  I have worked at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance at the University of Limerick for 23 years, designing and directing the first masters course in ethnochoreology at any university in Europe, and designing and directing the first masters course in dance performance focusing on Irish traditional dance at any university in the world.  I am a founding director of the National Dance Archive of Ireland and founding chair of Dance Research Forum Ireland.  I am the elected chair of the International Council for Traditional Music, ICTM, study group on ethnochoreology and an elected member of the ICTM executive board.  My dance performance training and ethnochoreological research encompasses Irish dance, Irish music, archives and festivals, with particular focus on issues of dance performance, dance documentation, identity, community, cultural heritage and tourism.  I address this meeting as a performer, an academic and, more recently, a director of the Firkin Crane.<\/p> <p>  Dance as a performance art has the potential to effect change, transcend ethnic and socioeconomic boundaries, challenge popular ideologies and bridge horizons of understanding between peoples of diverse cultures.  Dance as a performance art has the power to transform, educate and challenge.<\/p><p>The Firkin Crane places great importance on dance as a performance art.  Historically, this is illustrated by the fact that since the 1980s, it has been home to two professional dance companies, the Irish Ballet Company and the Irish National Ballet, both under the artistic directorship of Joan Denise Moriarty.  In the 1990s, the development officer, Mary Brady, made the Firkin Crane home to the Institute of Choreography and Dance, which placed a focus on choreographic research and dance performance.  With this focus, new dance work was created which included Michael Keegan-Dolan's 1997 work, \"Sunday Lunch\", which was launched when he founded Fabulous Beast Dance Theatre at the Firkin Crane.  Since 2006, the Firkin Crane has developed dance, dance audiences and dance initiatives in Cork under Paul McCarthy, the current CEO.<\/p><p> The Firkin Crane programme consists of four strands, namely, professional development and training; performance and production development; Cork city dance artists in residence at Firkin Crane; and youth and community dance.  The Firkin Crane therefore has a continuing dance legacy which it aims to sustain and develop further.  As well as providing access to advanced dance training and skills for dancers to pursue careers as professional dancers and to make and present new dance works, the Firkin Crane aspires to enable this training and knowledge to filter into the wider society.  For example, the Firkin Crane is located in a poor area of Cork city where extracurricular dance tuition is financially out of reach for the majority.  The Firkin Crane is attempting to address this issue by engaging dance artists in local schools to provide opportunities for young people to dance and to assist in building further audiences for dance as a performance art.  Moreover, with an ethos of inclusivity and diversity, the Firkin Crane engages with dancers of different abilities and disabilities across diverse ethnic, gender, age and class boundaries.  Examples of these inclusive dance initiatives include the Firkin Crane&rsquo;s ReCreate partnership with the Cope Foundation's department of arts and creative arts therapies in 2019.  This partnership aims to develop and pilot a range of performing arts based classes and leadership opportunities for marginalised adults at risk or unemployed who may wish to transition to employment in the performing arts sector.  Accreditation with the education and training board is being sought.  This follows an earlier partnership project with the Cope Foundation in 2015, which related to a training programme for carers and dance teachers with people with intellectual disabilities.  Other examples include the older people in dance programme, which was developed between the Firkin Crane and the HSE.  These collaborative and outreach programmes continue to be indicative of the ethos of inclusivity and diversity of the Firkin Crane.<\/p><p> The Firkin Crane aims to continue to develop as a centre of excellence in dance.  It has a twin-track objective.  First, it aims to provide advanced vocational training and creative opportunities for dancers to produce and present new dance work in order to pursue careers as professional dancers.  Second, it aims to develop inclusive dance which engages the wider community.  To realise these objectives, the Firkin Crane is undertaking a reorganisation of management structures, an independent expert review in consultation with the Arts Council of Ireland and the appointment of a new artistic director.<\/p><p> The Firkin Crane is fortunate in that it owns the historical Firkin Crane building on the north side of Cork city with dance studio spaces and a working theatre with a stage.  It is one of the few dance facilities in Ireland where dance can be made, produced and presented.  This is a valuable resource for aspiring and professional dancers and for audience development and engagement.  To facilitate the development of an inclusive dance programme, however, the Firkin Crane is currently securing a lease on the Butter Market House building, another historical building next door to the Firkin Crane.  This will also have a dedicated dance studio space.  Continued investment will be required to maintain and sustain the Firkin Crane as a leading place for dance in Ireland.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Firkin Crane, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing today and for their presentations.  This has been very refreshing.  The arts could teach politics so much, from the voice to the body.  Working in politics, we tend to live in our heads.  We have other ways of walking here.

It is also important in light of the fact that Ireland is set to become the fattest nation in Europe in 2020.<\/p> <p>  I was also interested in what the witnesses had to say about our elders.  I congratulate the witnesses on all the outreach and collaborative programmes which were mentioned.  My own pathology kicks in here.

Has there been insufficient projection of what could happen, as Ms Webster said?  Has this sector failed to highlight resources that have been given to it and have actually worked?  <\/p> <p>  Is it also the case that the witnesses have not spoken loudly enough about elders when talking to the Department of Health?  We only think of dance in connection with the Arts Council.  We do not connect it with social welfare, Tusla, education and the HSE.  Some collaborations were mentioned.  Do we not talk about those collaborations or is nobody listening?  Apart from the development of artists trying to live and work as dancers, form contemporary companies and promote dance in the same way as oral theatre, these collaborations are the most defined issue I have heard about here.  They are the most educationally and physically useful aspect.  The organisations represented here have done extraordinary work there. <\/p> <p>  My questions are general.  What can we do?  Does the Arts Council simply lack facilities because it does not get enough money, or does it not make the right decisions?  I am not playing a blame game.  I am just trying to find out.  Since dance is one of the most important areas and disciplines in our lives, can we not prioritise it accordingly?  The witnesses are all doing this in their own way.  What are we not listening to?  <\/p> <p>  I have asked very general questions rather than specific ones because all of the witnesses have made extraordinary and well-researched contributions.  The collaborations are really something else.

Through that, I have worked with the wonderful Dr. Foley on Irish dance.  I teach ballet and contemporary dance to undergraduate and postgraduate dancers in the University of Limerick.  It goes right across the board.  We have started a youth ballet company in Cork which operates out of the Firkin Crane, which we started three years ago.  I have worked in outreach programmes, including in Knocknaheeny in north Cork, bringing in dancers with talent who would be afraid to come into a building such as the Firkin Crane.  It has become more a part of the community.  Much is going on that is similar to that.  In answer to the question about the programmes for older people, working with the HSE, I have taught beginners' ballet to adults and we all see and feel the benefits.

That is the Arts Council's annual allocation for 2019.  There are many other budgets through which dance is supported, such as arts centre.  Virtually every arts centre in the country has dance programmes.  We recently saw extraordinary work by Irish choreographers working in collaboration with other artforms.  An example would be Emma Martin, who recently worked as a choreographer with the Irish National Opera.  All of the direct expenditure on dance is not reflected in that &euro;3.3 million.  I do not have the full breakdown of the allocation across the arts teams to hand.  I can give some figures off the top of my head.  The budget for arts centres last year was &euro;5.6 million.  The budget for festivals and events, of which a number are specifically dance festivals, was approximately &euro;2.8 million.  The budget for music is approximately &euro;4.6 million.  There is a variety of budgets.<\/p> <p>  I concur that the quality and strength of dance practice in Ireland at present is very strong, especially for a country of this size.  Dance companies such as Teac Damsa, CoisC&eacute;im and the resource organisations here today do work with an impact on our audiences.  We estimate that there were as many as 20,000 engagements between the public and dance across the country in 2019.  There is real strength and I think that will absolutely benefit from further investment.  I would equally make the case that other art forms would benefit from additional investment.  It is our role as the Government's agency to shepherd and support to ensure that we are investing as far forward as we can.  Ms Webster spoke about the benefit of advance planning.

We also have our participation activity project which called Broadreach.  It accesses around 5,000 people a year from primary schools to older people.  We have many projects for people aged 50 plus who collaborate with Age and Opportunity in the Bealtaine Festival.  We run a number of different projects with Dublin City Council.<\/p> <p>  To return to the points made by everyone, the core thing is that everyone agrees the pot is not big enough, but that is the pot.  How does one use those resources most effectively to be able to deliver what one can with the capacity one has?  In our experience, it is about collaboration.  If one has time, one has the possibility to move outside one's own box, to work with the Department of Health and with national and international agencies to access other strands of funding and develop those projects that can embed creative capacity in a meaningful way.  That is how we would look at it.<\/p> <p>  I totally echo what Ms Yurick said about dance and health and the immediate benefits one sees when working with older people.  This is exactly the same with younger people and children.  With \"The Wolf and Peter\", we worked together with the St. Patrick's College, now DCU Institute of Education, where we were in residence for three years, to develop a digital resource for educators that is freely available on the arts and education portal.  It includes four lesson plans for educators to use in their own schools.  This is a series of workshop programmes for children aged six to ten.

I mean no disrespect to PE teachers.  They are marvellous and have been doing a great service by bringing dance to secondary schools.  There are university programmes, such as the one in UL, and young people go to university to obtain degrees in dance but I would like these dancers to go back into the education system.  I would like the Government to recognise dance in a serious way.  I did a PhD in dance 30 years ago.  It was the first in the world in Irish dance.  I did it because I wondered why nobody was doing it.  I knew it could be done.  I did not do it because I believed it would result in anything afterwards but because I loved it and believed in it.  I believe in it to this day.  Dance is an extraordinary field.  We have all talked around this table about the power of dance and how it crosses psychological and ideological divides.  I refer to all the agendas beyond the physicality of the body, including tackling health issues.  The power of dance is quite incredible but the Government needs to recognise that.  It can happen within the education system.  The Government needs to recognise dance as a serious school subject.<br\/><br\/>Years ago, perhaps in secondary school, I was told that if I was academic, I should do the sciences and that if I was not, I should do the softer subjects, such as music.  I asked why that should be.  I believe we are now changing but I would love to see dance in secondary schools.  As with the music system, it is not a matter of ballet or contemporary dance but of all dance.  Irish dancers, in particular, have rarely been included in this regard.  When I was at university, doing a music degree, I was told during the Irish music module that I could play a bodhr&aacute;n but that I would not be allowed to do an Irish dance.  That was when I was 20.  I believed there was something wrong when dance, as an intelligence, was not recognised.<br\/><br\/>Howard Gardner wrote a book called <i>Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences<\/i>.  Dance is an intelligence.  It upsets me to see it is not recognised as such.  It is not given the credit it deserves and it is not acknowledged for what it is.  I believe strongly in dance and I want it everywhere.  I want it to be an inclusive art and I want it in the educational system.  I want to see an advancement of the technical training of professional dancers in Ireland because it is not just a matter of one or the other; it is a question of many facets in Ireland.  Dance fulfils many functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019101600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1571180400,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Papers are currently being written on changes people would like to be made to the leaving certificate curriculum.

In the 1980s, a curriculum was developed in this regard.  I was part of the Dance Council of Ireland.  It was considered a first step towards a syllabus for primary school teachers through which to deliver dance in schools.  Then there was a focus on secondary level, where the syllabus was to have modern dance for secondary school students, but the teachers were not dancers.  There may be wonderful PE teachers but some may not be into dance.  If we are to go into schools, we should speak the language and talk the talk.  A trained dancer has a big toolbox.  We know contemporary dance and ballet.  We have done a little hip-hop.  One gets the students with the hip-hop in the schools and then develops their creativity and choreography.  There is a bigger blend of styles.<\/p> <p>  We were asked whether there has been a shift away from companies.  There was definitely a shift at the time of the recession.  Many companies suffered cutbacks.  The budget shrank and the strategy was then to spread out all the funding.  I came out of a milieu in which funding was guaranteed for three years.  One knew exactly what one had.  We were able to deliver a beautiful centre for dance in the three years.  Three parties, including the county council and the developer, were put together to do that.  It is still open and thriving.  We could not have done this had we not known that we had funding for three years.

The Government recently reversed the decision to bring history back as a core subject, having previously made the decision to make it a discrete subject.  We sometimes think we are moving on when we are actually moving 40 ft backwards.

That is a general point.  The other point is that we now use the term \"culture and heritage\" to describe art.  We no longer refer to literature, dance, drama, oracy, literacy and visual art.  We now refer to culture.  It is akin to a Tescoisation of what we are because we are afraid to refer to creative Ireland, the Arts Council and culture.  There is also increasing competition in this area.  Rather than leave the Arts Council to what it was doing, we now have the Creative Ireland Programme and its funding, with applicants now having to navigate their way through various funding streams.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses are here for good reason.
